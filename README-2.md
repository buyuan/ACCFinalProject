# Web Search Engine

A search engine is a software deployed typically on the web to perform searches and produce relevant results. Search engines typically index the web and maintain real-time information by using web crawlers. They use pattern searching algorithms to find keywords on the web pages. The web pages are ranked to produce results which are most relevant to the search query.



## Features 

- Web Crawler : It uses Jsoup which is a Java library to parse HTML documents. It is used to download .html files from the web.
- HTML to Text : It converts .html files to .txt files.
- Pattern searching : We used Ternary Search Trie (TST) for searching keywords in the .txt files.
- Page Ranking : We used merge sort to rank web pages according to the frequency of keywords in a given text file.

## Deployment

To deploy this project import it in the Eclipse IDE and run TST.java to start the search engine.
