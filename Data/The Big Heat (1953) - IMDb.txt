Bannion is tipped off after a colleague's suicide and his fellow officers' suspicious silence lead him to believe that they are on the gangsters' payroll. When a bomb meant for him kills his wife instead, Bannion becomes a furious force of vengeance and justice, aided along the way by the gangster's spurned girlfriend Debby. As Bannion and Debby fall further and further into the Gangland's insidious and brutal trap, they must use any means necessary (including murder) to get to the truth. —alfiehitchie murdersuicide notescalded facedisfigurementcorruption219 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines VICE... DICE ...and CORRUPTION! Genres Crime Film-Noir Thriller Certificate Not Rated Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia As Dave Bannion leaves The Retreat after he first sees Vince Stone face to face, the music in the background is "Put the Blame on Mame," a reference to Glenn Ford's performance in Gilda (1946). Goofs When Dave Bannion is conversing with the commissioner and things get heated, the commissioner asks Bannion, "Just what are you inferring?". This is a common mistake, because Bannion was not inferring anything; he was 'implying' - it was the commissioner who was inferring. Quotes Debby Marsh: [to Bannion] Oh, well, you're about as romantic as a pair of handcuffs. Connections Featured in Mean Streets (1973) Soundtracks It's a Blue World (uncredited) Written by Chet Forrest and Bob Wright Heard instrumentally during one of the scenes at The Retreat User reviews172 Review Top review 8/10 nice attention to detail A violent story about a detective working in a corrupt department who investigates the apparent suicide of a fellow officer. Worth seeing for Glenn Ford's prototypical performance and Gloria Grahme's show stealing portrayal of a boozing moll with a conscience. With facial disfigurement and cigarette burns it took violence up a notch from the standard gun play of the past, making it grimmer and more realistic, and giving the story more punch. Grahme's tough and tender role stands out and gives the film a tragic element, while certain of its portrayals of greed and corruption (namely the dead officer's wife) stand out for their attention to detail. In the end, it IS the details that give this formulaic story its clout, and we can thank director Fritz Lang for that. helpful•46 7 RanchoTuVu Mar 24, 2005 FAQ2 New York Opening Happened When?
