From a grand country house where a game of 'sardines' leads to some chilling revelations in a wardrobe; to a very oddly haunted house; to a blood-soaked actor's dressing room in London's West End; to the flat of an apparently happy primary school teacher who becomes the victim of a good deed; these unpredictable tales feature high comedy and claustrophobic horror by turns. —BBC anthologyensemble castblack comedywritten by starsurrealism2 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines From the Writers of The League of Gentlemen and Psychoville Genres Comedy Drama Horror Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Steve Pemberton stated in an interview (Mail February 25, 2017) that the only link between the stories is a small statue of a hare that he and Shearsmith place in each set. Connections Featured in 50 Years of BBC2 Comedy (2014) User reviews75 Review Top review 10/10 Inside No 9 .....A Classic This is the funniest half hour I have had watching TV for a long time , it started with slapstick ,turned to hilarious comedy with the two hapless burglars ,and then came the bedroom /bathroom scene ,this was worthy of the best of any of David Jason's scenes in Fools and Horses ,I had to pause the programme to wipe away the tears of laughter. No sooner had the hilarity ended then we had a moment of high drama followed by more comedy with the dumb salesman and then the grand finale which took me completely by surprise . The plot twisted and turned and was brilliantly written and acted . I can't wait for the next Inside No 9. helpful•25 6 harry-skye Feb 14, 2014 Details Edit Release date February 5, 2014 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Official site British Broadcasting Corporation (United Kingdom) Language English Also known as 9号秘事 Production company British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 30 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news Link Tank: Stream the Microsoft Windows 11 Reveal Event Live Here Jun 24Den of Geek Summer Premiere Dates For New & Returning TV Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming Jun 15Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What was the official certification given to Inside No. 9 (2014) in Canada?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
