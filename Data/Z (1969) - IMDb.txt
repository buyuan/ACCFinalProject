The organization's charismatic leader - the deputy - is scheduled to arrive in the town from the capital the day of the rally. Beyond the problems arranging the rally due to the probable incitement of violence at such a rally, the organization learns of an unconfirmed report that there will be an attempt on the deputy's life. The rally does happen, after which a three-wheeled kamikaze runs over the deputy, who eventually passes away from his injuries. The official report is that the incident was a drunken accident. In reality, the deputy's death was murder orchestrated by the secret police, the general for who likens the pacifist organization to mildew killing off agricultural crops. A magistrate is assigned to the case. Although he does have political views, he is more interested in finding out the truth, and as such has to wade through the political rhetoric and politically motivated testimony he hears. Thrown into the mix is a photojournalist who too is looking for the truth, as it, he believes, will make a great front page story. —Huggo murder investigationrallyright wingpolicegovernment188 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Enough excitement to even eclipse James Bond Genres Crime Drama History Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) M Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The actors falling off the truck had to do their own stunts as the low budget would not allow for a stuntman.

The Greek people had successfully expelled the Nazis when English forces invaded the country and put the Nazi collaborators in power. The US army took over the effort in 1947, rounding up thousands of people and putting them in reeducation camps. By 1949, the "civil war" was over, with Greece under military rule. Then, the story portrayed in "Z". Dr. Gregorios Lambrakis was beginning to speak for the people, when the junta gunned him down. In "Z", we get to see the investigation into the murder, exposing how the generals orchestrated it. They never say that the movie happens in Greece (although it clearly does), and more than simply a look at the CIA-installed regime that was ruling Greece from 1967 to 1974, it's a reminder of all totalitarian governments in the world. "Z" will very likely chill you. helpful•58 17 lee_eisenberg Aug 2, 2005 Details Edit Release date February 26, 1969 (France) Countries of origin France Algeria Official sites Criterion (United States) Official site Languages French Russian English Also known as Z - Anatomie eines politischen Mordes Filming locations St. George Hotel, 24 Avenue Soudoni Boudjemaa, Algiers, Algeria Production companies Valoria Films Reggane Films Office National pour le Commerce et l'Industrie Cinématographique (ONCIC) See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross US & Canada $83,305 Opening weekend US & Canada $10,144 Mar 15, 2009 Gross worldwide $83,305 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 2 hours 7 minutes Color Color Sound mix Mono Aspect ratio 1.66 : 1 Related news Mikis Theodorakis Dies: ‘Zorba The Greek’ Composer Was 96 Sep 2Deadline Film + TV What Does The “Parasite” Win Mean For The Future Of The Academy Awards?
