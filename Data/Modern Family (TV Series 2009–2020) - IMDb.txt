Parents Phil and Claire yearn for an honest, open relationship with their three kids, but a daughter who is trying to grow up too fast, another who is too smart for her own good, and a rambunctious young son make it challenging. Claire's dad Jay and his Latina wife Gloria are raising two sons together, but people sometimes believe Jay to be Gloria's father. Jay's gay son Mitchell and his partner Cameron have adopted a little Asian girl, completing one big -- straight, gay, multicultural, traditional -- happy family. —Jwelch5742 family relationshipsensemble castgay relationshipmockumentarygay character51 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines One big (straight, gay, multi-cultural, traditional) happy family. Genres Comedy Drama Romance Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia All the actors and actresses made a pact since the first season to always submit themselves to awards ceremonies in supporting roles, never leading. Goofs Mitchell and Cameron adopted a child from Vietnam. This is legally impossible as Vietnam's laws forbid a child to be adopted by single parents or same sex couples. They could still adopt the child illegally but then it would be impossible to bring it back to the States. Quotes Phil Dunphy: Gotta fix that step. Crazy credits At the beginning of each episode, the actors' names appear on screen in order of their character's ages.

Each and every single one. Well, just about... After pretty good first few seasons, everything that followed was getting harder and harder to watch. Jokes are so lame that elicit more and more facepalms. The only character i still respect in this show is Ed O'Neill, and that is just because he used to be a women's shoe salesman... I will never forget Al Bundy. helpful•76 57 dubravko-pavlovic Feb 21, 2017 FAQ5 I just watched the "Goodnight, Gracie" episode about Phil's mom dying. Was she ever introduced on the show? How well does this series represent the LGBT community? Is Jay widowed or divorced?
