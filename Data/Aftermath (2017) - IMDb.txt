Genres Drama Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for a scene of violence Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Based on the real-life crash of Bashkirian Airlines Flight 2937 and DHL Flight 611. The incident occurred on July 1, 2002, when the two planes crashed into each other in midair over the town of Überlingen, Germany. Goofs In the United States, the transition altitude is 18,000 ft. Flight levels, which are approximated altitudes based on standard air pressure, are only used above the transition altitude, as it simplifies operations at high altitude. However, under 18,000 ft, the actual altitude as read using the correct local air pressure is used instead, and expressed in feet, not flight levels. Therefore, an air controller would not ask an aircraft to descend to flight level 65, but rather ask to descend to 6500 ft. Correction: This statement is true for the United States, but not every country uses 18,000 ft as the transition altitude. Germany for example uses 5000 ft, and in Switzerland it's 7000 ft. So, issuing a clearance to FL 065 is correct depending on the country. This accident happened over Germany. Quotes Roman: Look at this photo. I would like for someone to say that they're sorry for killing my family.

It's strongest moments were early as the story of the crash unfolded. It was terrifyingly mundane, just another work day for Jake in which a very understandably human mistake was made. Only, this mistake resulted in the collision of two passenger planes and unspeakable tragic loss of life. Arnold Schwarzenegger does a fantastic job portraying the strong, older man who loses his family and lacks the emotional equipment to process it. Scoot McNairy is perfectly cast and conveys the guilt and depression of Jake with heart wrenching power. Unfortunately this story becomes less and less interesting as it progresses. perhaps that's a credit to the filmmakers for not adding dramatic power by adapting it too much. But, ultimately at the end I felt a sort of, "That's it...?" If you're a Schwarzenegger or McNairy fan, you might enjoy it. Otherwise, Aftermath fails to deliver. helpful•16 6 LorenBieg Jan 30, 2018 Details Edit Release date April 7, 2017 (United Kingdom) Countries of origin United Kingdom United States Languages English Thai Also known as 478 Filming locations Columbus, Ohio, USA Production companies Emmett/Furla/Oasis Films (EFO Films) Grindstone Entertainment Group Hat and Cat Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $10,500,000 (estimated) Gross worldwide $840,809 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 34 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 2.39 : 1 Related news 'Covid-19' Hits "House of the Dragon" Jul 19SneakPeek Star Wars: The Bad Batch Episode 1 Questions Answered and Theories May 6Den of Geek Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Hindi language plot outline for Aftermath (2017)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
