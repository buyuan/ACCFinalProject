The whole world is made of Styrofoam, the human body is made of rubber. Play GTA and you will have the same experience. So extremely absurd that it gets funny, if you do not sleep first...

Many shows were cancelled for good. The interviews were kind of funny and the audience in the parking lot (imagine that!!!) seemed to be having some fun, too. I was rooting for Denali then Gottmik/Rosé, but Symone is great, too. Be grateful. See you in Drag Race Down Under...

When her time comes, shall his grandchildren put her in the same institution and even in the SAME ROOM of his. Quoting the movie: "It'd be better for HER".

Well, a successful TV show is not linear: it must have love-hate polarization, drama, plot twists, resurrections... Particularly for this episode it is important that you watch "Untucked".

I didn't know exactly what Silk Road was and I really don't understand the low ratings. You must know some computer terminology to understand the plot: IP address, bitcoin. One quote defines the whole movie " He's like the first millennial gangster". If you liked it, I recommend the movies about Snowden, Wikileaks and Pirate Bay.

Dr. Giggles has on hand best funny one-liners than Arnold in Commando or Freddy Krueger in Nightmare. All the girls are pretty. Creepy scenery. Interesting revenge plot like Dr. Phibes. Cool quaint doctors wardrobe. Scary surgical devices from hell. And finally an amazing turn of tables. A must-see for all horror-comedy fans.

In order to fully understand this movie, I strongly recommend the reading of chapter XI "A antropofagia ritual dos tupinambás" in the book "A RELIGIÃO DOS TUPINAMBÁS" written by Alfred Métraux. The film is very accurate to the depiction from surviving eyewitnesses.

It is NOT a film for action and CGI fans. The protagonist is not a man, it is an illness. It depicts the horrific exploits of the most cruel and merciless gangster: sickness. Disease does not care in the least about how powerful or rich a man is. No epic drive-by shootings or liquidation of rivals with baseball bats, but: organic degeneration, torture from inside the body, mental self-implosion and madness followed by the all-redeming death. Lo and behold, it could be a despondent glimpse into anyone's future...
