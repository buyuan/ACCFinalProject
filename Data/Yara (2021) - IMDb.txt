Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Crime Drama Thriller Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia All entries contain spoilers User reviews24 Review Top review 9/10 IT'S PAINSTAKING WORK For all intents and purposes, this is a cold case but prosecutor Letizia Ruggeri's decision to embark on reverse investigation focusing on DNA analysis backed up by a database of DNA samples was crucial to unmasking the killer. As the film shows, it's a slow, painstaking process but, in the end, it yielded a perfect match. It's not all science; otherwise, it could be boring. There's genuine drama as well focusing on the family's deep grief and Ruggeri's steely determination to catch the criminal. This film is more about Ruggeri as investigator than about the victim or her grieving family but it's compelling nonetheless. The director succeeds in re-constructing a true story that doesn't sound like a documentary. Isabella Ragonese effectively portrays her role as the crusading prosecutor. A fitting message from her is, a quitter never wins. Watch this film. It's uplifting. helpful•4 2 albertval-69560 Nov 9, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 18, 2021 (Italy) Country of origin Italy Official site Official site Language Italian Also known as Яра See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 36 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Netflix to Release Top 10 Reports Weekly for English and Non-English TV and Films Nov 16Variety Film + TV ‘Red Notice’ Seizes Biggest Netflix Movie Opening Weekend Ever; Italian Pic ‘Yara’ Tops Streamer’s New Weekly Charts Nov 16Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Yara (2021) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
