Genres Action Sci-Fi Sport Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for violence, extreme sports action, sensuality, language and some drug references Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia LL Cool J admitted on LL Cool J/Joe Pantoliano/Neil Finn (2003) that the film "sucked" but that it was his duty to promote the film. Goofs Just before the game when Aurora is transferred to the Horde, the announcer says, "There are four teams in the quarter finals." When it's the quarter finals, there are always 8 teams left. Quotes Chinese Sports Announcer: It's simple, about as simple as using a name-brand condom! Alternate versions US theatrical version was edited (splashes of blood, language and a full frontal nudity scene by Rebecca Romijn) for a more commercial PG-13 rating. The DVD/VHS release features the uncut version and is rated R.

Records Inc. By Arrangement with Warner Special Products User reviews307 Review Top review Why! The original film was a masterpiece. Not only for the (at the time) over-the-top action, but for the marvelously clear look into the future. Only science-fiction would dare suggest the future holds society completely employed by six corporations! What a brilliant prophecy! In the self-centered and hedonistic 70's, isn't it amazing the true gist of the original film is the attempt to keep a famous player from becoming bigger than the game he plays? One need only peruse today's business section to see how our society now strives to eliminate the notion of the individual in favor of an identity-nullifying "team concept." So one can say the original is all about the triumph of the individual. The 2002 version is nothing more than a haphazard mess that shows what happens when a studio changes hands and a cinematic vision is compromised for a PG-13 rating that effectively destroys the film. Rollerball could do with a well-intentioned remake; this wasn't it.................by a long shot. helpful•37 13 anborn3000 Oct 31, 2004 Details Edit Release date February 8, 2002 (United States) Countries of origin United States Germany Japan Official site MGM Languages English Russian French Arabic Korean German Japanese Also known as Ölüm Pateni Filming locations Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada Production companies Atlas Entertainment Helkon Media Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $70,000,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $18,990,798 Opening weekend US & Canada $9,013,548 Feb 10, 2002 Gross worldwide $25,852,764 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 38 minutes Color Color Sound mix DTS Dolby Digital SDDS Aspect ratio 2.39 : 1 Related news Everything Coming To Netflix, Disney Plus, HBO Max, Hulu And Prime This Weekend Jan 1We Got This Covered What’s Coming to HBO Max in January 2021 Dec 30Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Rollerball (2002) officially released in Canada in French?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
