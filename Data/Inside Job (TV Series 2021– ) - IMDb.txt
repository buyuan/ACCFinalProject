From convoluted coverups to secret societies to masked orgy etiquette, navigating office culture at Cognito Inc. can be tricky, especially for anti-social tech genius Reagan Ridley. Even in a workplace filled with reptilian shapeshifters and psychic mushrooms, she's seen as the odd one out for believing the world could be a better place. Reagan thinks she can make a difference, if only she could manage her unhinged, manifesto-writing father, her irresponsible coworkers, and finally snag the promotion she's been dreaming about. conspiracyadult animationstateworkplacejob15 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Nothing to See Here.

Connections Featured in AniMat's Crazy Cartoon Cast: Sci-Fi Special Feature (2019) User reviews103 Review Top review 8/10 Starts weak-ish, ends strong-ish. Can't wait to see more. Pros The main character (Reagan) is likable enough to want the best for her, but flawed enough to be believable. She's able to be shown as unattractive, socially inept, emotionally vulnerable, megalomaniacal, and human. She's like if Rick & Morty were one smart but insecure character. Reagan is rarely at her best, but she's trying her hardest and is great. Bret is Reagan's Morty and best friend/coworker. Bret is gorgeous but stupid and has nice comedic and friend chemistry because of the similar childhoods/social ineptitudes they share. Her dad is entertaining and interesting... Cons The show feels desperate to fill time by throwing everything at the wall. It's trying too hard. Not all the jokes land but the ones that don't aren't that painful. That joke pacing gives it a Rick & Morty feel without the same punch or like Futurama with a less fleshed out supporting cast (still first season so it could get better). The emotional/self improvement stuff can be rushed and sometimes feels like it's breaking the continuity of previous episodes. Conclusion The writers did a good job but some of the episodes (in the first half) feel rushed and unpolished. If they had fewer episodes or more time this could've been (and could still be) one of the greats. helpful•5 0 grantlauzon Nov 5, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 22, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Netflix Site Language English Also known as Văn Phòng Thuyết Âm Mưu Production company Netflix Animation See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 30 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Related news Lizzy Caplan to Star in ‘Fleishman Is in Trouble’ Series at FX on Hulu Nov 16Variety Film + TV Lizzy Caplan To Star In ‘Fleishman Is In Trouble’ FX On Hulu Limited Series Nov 16Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
