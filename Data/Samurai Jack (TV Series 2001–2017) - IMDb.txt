Before he can complete his task, though, he is catapulted thousands of years into the future. He finds himself in a world where Aku now enjoys complete power over every living thing. Dubbing himself "Jack", he sets out on a new quest - to right the wrongs that have been done by his enemy, and to find a way back to his own time so he can destroy the evil for good. —Alan Back <ajback@yahoo.com> samuraiswordvillainquestcult tv60 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines In the future evil takes many forms, and our only hope is one man from the past. Genres Animation Action Adventure Drama Fantasy Sci-Fi Thriller Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Creator Genndy Tartakovsky has acknowledged taking some of his inspiration from the Frank Miller graphic novel "Ronin", including the premise of a masterless samurai warrior thrown into a dystopic future ahead of our present. Quotes Aku: Long ago in a distant land, I, Aku, the shape shifting master of darkness, unleashed an unspeakable evil. But a foolish samurai warrior wielding a magic sword stepped forth to oppose me. Before the final blow was struck, I tore open a portal in time, and flung him into the future where my evil is law. Now the fool seeks to return to the past and undo the future that is Aku. Crazy credits Season 4 ended with Episode 52, and season 5 starts with Episode 92, leaving a gap of 39 episodes to emphasize how much time has passed. Connections Featured in 100 Greatest Cartoons (2005) Soundtracks Never Forget You Performed by Zara Larsson and MNEK User reviews112 Review Top review A brilliant production on every level. It seems that Genndy Tartakovsky was only getting warmed up with "Dexter's Laboratory" and "Powerpuff Girls". With those shows he proved he was a comic genius; with "Samurai Jack" he demonstrates that he is a genius, period. Every single aspect of the movie premiere is top-notch. Phil LaMarr is wonderful as Jack. James Venable's score beautifully captures the tone and has just the right mix of traditional Oriental and electronic sounds. I liked the fact that there did not seem to be any unnecessary dialogue (in fact several scenes--most notably the beginning--have almost no dialogue at all). The animation and backgrounds are very stylish and striking, and the filmmakers even allow the art to escape the confines of the square 1.33:1 TV ratio with some split-screen and widescreen shots used to great effect. It is my hope that the series continues to be as good as the premiere is. This will be on you "must-watch" list. helpful•67 6 Figaro-8 Aug 10, 2001 FAQ3 What is Jack's real name?
