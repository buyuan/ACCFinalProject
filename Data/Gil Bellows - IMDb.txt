Personal Quote: (2010) I'm really proud of a movie that not a lot of people have seen - Love and a .45 (1994) - that was one of the first things I did. I'd say that I'm super proud of only four or five things I've done, but mostly I'd like to be remembered as a really good actor who people enjoyed watching.
