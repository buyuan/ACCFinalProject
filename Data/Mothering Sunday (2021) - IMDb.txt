User reviews6 Review Top review 6/10 A lusty, deeply melancholy portrayal of loss and its lasting impact Eva Husson's first English-language film, 'Mothering Sunday,' is a lusty, deeply melancholy portrayal of loss and its lasting impact that often feels disjointed and uneven. It's pretty to look at with impressive performances (and sizzling chemisty) from Odessa Young and Josh O'Connor but, unfortunately, doesn't offer much else. helpful•9 0 Sir_AmirSyarif Oct 4, 2021 Details Edit Release date November 12, 2021 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Official site Official site Language English Also known as Роман служанки Production companies British Film Institute (BFI) Film4 Lipsync Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 44 minutes Color Color Related news ‘Mothering Sunday’ Trailer: Odessa Young and Josh O’Connor Find Romance Painful in Interwar Britain Nov 13Indiewire Mothering Sunday Trailer: Odessa Young, Josh O’Connor, Olivia Colman & Colin Firth Lead Eva Husson’s Drama Nov 12The Film Stage Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Brazilian Portuguese language plot outline for Mothering Sunday (2021)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
