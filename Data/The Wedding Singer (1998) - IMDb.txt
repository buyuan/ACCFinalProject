He also can keep the party going in good spirit, he knows what to say and when to say it. Julia is a waitress at the events where Robbie performs. When both of them find someone to marry and prepare for their weddings, it becomes clear that they've chosen wrong partners. —Anonymous 1980syear 1985confession of lovetransvestitestockbroker94 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines He's gonna party like it's 1985. Genres Comedy Music Romance Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for sex-related material and language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The butterfly jean jacket that Julia wears throughout the movie belongs to Drew Barrymore. Director Frank Coraci liked her jacket and told her to wear it as part of her costume. Goofs Frank and Rosie are supposed to be celebrating their 50th anniversary. However, the picture on the wall of their wedding is dated 1948, which is 50 years before the film was released in 1998. However it's set in 1985, which was 37 years since 1948. Quotes Robbie: [singing] I wanna make you smile whenever you're sad / Carry you around when your arthritis is bad / All I wanna do is grow old with you. / I'll get your medicine when your tummy aches / build you a fire if the furnace breaks / Oh it could be so nice, growin old with you. / I'll miss you, kiss you, give you my coat when you are cold. / Need you, feed you, I'll even let you hold the remote control. / So let me do the dishes in the kitchen sink / Put you to bed when you've had too much to drink. / Oh I could be the man to grow old with you. / I wanna grow old with you. Crazy credits On the VHS version, after the credits there are three Karaoke style 80's songs. Alternate versions The Extended Version, available on UK DVD known as "Totally Awesome Edition" adds around three minutes to the Theatrical Version and features an uncontentious additional dialogue scene where Robbie talks to Rosie about penis size. Connections Edited into The Goldbergs: The Wedding Singer (2019) Soundtracks Somebody Kill Me Written by Adam Sandler and Tim Herlihy Performed by Adam Sandler Produced by Brooks Arthur User reviews382 Review Top review 10/10 This movie floored me I'm usually pretty cynical about cheesy movies but this movie absolutely floored me. Drew Barrymore was phenomenal playing role of Julia Sullivan. I've seen the movie at least 30 times by now and her expressions still make me cry, they're just so sincere. I don't know how else to put it. As for Adam Sandler I think that this is his best role yet, he's a real person in this movie not just some overgrown immature goofball. On top of everything it's a brilliant 80s satire, for me its right up there with American Psycho. I understand why someone would have reservations about watching this movie but my advice would be to put your cynicism aside for a couple of hours and just watch with an uncritical mind. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. helpful•152 27 sonata13 Dec 4, 2002 FAQ2 What relation is Holly to Julia? What are the differences between the Theatrical Version and the Extended Cut?
