Personal Quotes (1) When I look back, I always say, 'Oh, I never thought I'd be an actor,' and my parents always say, 'Really?' I have this image of myself as a sort of quiet, observant little girl, and they're like, 'No, no, no. You were bossy,' and all these other things, so I guess I did sort of have an eye on it. I've never felt terribly attached to acting because I always feel like the world is really big and really interesting, and there are a lot of places that I can put my energy and be fulfilled. I'm not worried about it. But for now it's really fun. I have to remind myself how long I've been doing it, because it still feels like just this little lark I went on when I went to graduate school. It used to be a side trip, but now it's the main road. I have to remind myself that this is what's happening.
