Soundtracks Half Forgotten Daydreams Written by John Cameron Courtesy of APM Music on behalf of EMI Music Publishing User reviews41 Review Top review 4/10 You should only watch the trailer The trailer made the film look much better than it is. It tried to be deep, philosophical, existential, and largely failed. It also felt so un-relatable, looking at this privileged white LA girl life. A good story is one where you root for the characters, where something resonates with you, where the themes are universal. Where you have the story on the surface, but you're also telling a deeper story through the story. Like how Jaws is about sharks but really is about 3 very different dudes learning to work together. Here, there's non of that. Characters are flat. Feels fake. At least it was short. The only good thing in this movie was Cailee Spaeny. helpful•5 2 roxlerookie Jul 29, 2021 Details Edit Release date July 20, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Нам всем конец Filming locations Los Angeles, California, USA Production company Mister Lister Films See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross US & Canada $16,104 Gross worldwide $16,104 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 22 minutes Color Color Related news Zoe Lister-Jones Joins Zach Braff’s ‘A Good Person’ At MGM Oct 25Deadline Film + TV Through Her Lens: Tribeca & Chanel Set Participants, Masterclass Advisors, Mentors & Jurors For Seventh Edition Of Program Bolstering Women Filmmakers Oct 12Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was How It Ends (2021) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
