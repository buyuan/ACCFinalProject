However, when Johnny rescues a bullied kid, Miguel, from bullies, he is inspired to restart the notorious Cobra Kai dojo. However, this revitalization of his life and related misunderstandings find Johnny restarting his old rivalry with Daniel LaRousso, a successful businessman who may be happily married, but is missing an essential balance in life since the death of his mentor, Mr. Miyagi. Meanwhile, even as this antipathy festers, it finds itself reflected in their protegees as Miguel and his comrades are gradually poisoned by Cobra Kai's thuggish philosophy. Meanwhile, while Daniel's daughter, Samantha, finds herself in the middle of this conflict amidst false friends, Johnny's estranged miscreant son, Robby, finds himself inadvertently coming under Daniel's wing and flourishes in ways worthy of Mr. Miyagi. —Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) web series30 years latersenseitv sequel to theatrical moviealliterative title45 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines The KARATE KID saga continues. (Season 1) Genres Action Comedy Drama Sport Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia During the original Karate Kid shoot, late director John G. Avildsen shot hours of tournament footage from multiple angles. The crew behind Cobra Kai searched the studio vault and found a ton of never-before-seen clips, which they were able to introduce into the series via flashbacks. One of them includes Zabka's real life mom, who was in the stands in different angles that went unseen until 2018. Ralph Macchio told Uproxx there are three brand new angles of the famous crane kick. Goofs Many people believe that Miyagi's name on his headstone is a continuity error, given that in The Next Karate Kid (1994) his name is stated to be Keisuke, but it was actually shown previously on a sign being held for him by Chozen in The Karate Kid Part II (1986) to be Nariyoshi. This means that it was The Next Karate Kid that changed his name, while Cobra Kai kept the name previously given for him. Another interesting fact, however, is that the name given in The Karate Kid Part II was not the original first name given to Miyagi. In The Karate Kid (1984), it can briefly be seen on Miyagi's dog tags, attached to the keys of the 1948 Ford given to Daniel for his birthday, that Miyagi's first name is Hideo. Connections Featured in The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon: Anthony Mackie/Ralph Macchio/Kiry Shabazz (2018) User reviews2K Review Top review 10/10 Everything You Would Hope It's corny, predictable, steeped in 1980's nostalgia, full of nods to the original... and those are just some of the reasons to LOVE it! Credit to everyone involved in the making of this series. If you are a fan of the original films then this is going to be exactly what you are looking for. John Avildsen and Pat Morita are definitely here in spirit. Perfect for binge-watching and for transporting yourself back 30 years! :) helpful•193 28 Kroshaw May 3, 2018 FAQ5 Will there be a third season? How is Johnny Lawrence allowed to reopen the business of the "Cobra Kai dojo"? Does Kreese have any rights to the name? This series is apparently directly connected to some old 80's film, so must you have seen that film to grasp the story properly?
