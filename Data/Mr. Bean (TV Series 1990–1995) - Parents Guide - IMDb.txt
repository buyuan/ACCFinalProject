Contains brief instances of very mild natural nudity and innuendo throughout the course of the series. In two episodes ("The Curse of Mr. Bean" and "Mr. Bean in Room 426"), Mr. Bean manages to get himself stranded naked in a public place. Genital nudity is comically obscured, however, his rear end is briefly exposed during these episodes. Edit In the episode "Back to School, Mr. Bean", Mr. Bean is horrified when he is expected to sketch a topless model in an art class at an adult education facility (only the model's bare back is visible to the audience). He creates a clay brassiere in order to obscure her breasts. Later, Mr. Bean's pants are unintentionally taken by another person. Mr. Bean tries to retrieve them forcefully while the man is in a cubicle at a public restroom. Edit Add an item Violence & Gore None 32 of 39 found this to have none Severity?
