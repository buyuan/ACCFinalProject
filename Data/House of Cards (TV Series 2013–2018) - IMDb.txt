Dashing, cunning, methodical and vicious, Frank Underwood along with his equally manipulative yet ambiguous wife, Claire, take Washington by storm through climbing the hierarchical ladder to power in this Americanized recreation of the BBC series of the same name. —Jacob Oberfrank breaking the fourth wallpolitical corruptiongovernment corruptionmedia manipulationmachiavellianism25 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Genre Drama Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Michel Gill (President Walker) and Jayne Atkinson (Catherine Durant) are married in real life. Quotes Francis Underwood: Such a waste of talent. He chose money over power. In this town, a mistake nearly everyone makes. Money is the McMansion in Sarasota that starts falling apart after 10 years. Power is the old stone building that stands for centuries. I cannot respect someone who doesn't see the difference. Connections Featured in The Wright Stuff: Episode #18.25 (2013) User reviews895 Review Top review 9/10 If Television Series Were Ships... If television series were ships, then "House of Cards" is without a doubt The Titanic. Both had their origins in the U. K. Both were launched amid much fanfare and had an amazing and fruitful beginning and middle run. And both slammed into an iceberg and ended in disaster! Of course this proverbial iceberg for "House of Cards" is Season 6. It's sad to see how Netflix likes to launch amazingly popular and brilliant series only to stab them to death or just dump them far too soon. And, in the case of "House of Cards", it was because of the "Cancel Culture" bullcrap that is spreading like a cancer throughout our society. Fortunately, seasons 1 through 5 can stand on their own, and they are a worthwhile watch. Kevin Spacey is one of the most talented actors out there, and what he did or didn't do 3 decades ago really doesn't matter. He made and carried "House of Cards", and without him, the show became pointless. Enjoy the first 5 seasons. Then move on. N. B. The 9/10 review is for Seasons 1 through 5 only.! helpful•16 2 marsradio May 15, 2021 FAQ1 Isn't this based on (insert name of American political figure here) Details Edit Release date February 1, 2013 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Official Facebook Official site Language English Also known as Ván Bài Chính Trị Filming locations 2601 Greenmount Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland, USA Production companies Media Rights Capital (MRC) Netflix Panic Pictures (II) See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 51 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 2.00 : 1 Related news ‘Voir’ Trailer: David Fincher’s Latest Netflix Collaboration Is A Visual Essay Series About Cinema Nov 11The Playlist Mahershala Ali Limited Series ‘The Plot’ Draws Multiple Bidders (Exclusive) Nov 5Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
