The Tontos and the Mescaleros Apaches have stirred trouble in recent months, partially to protest against settlers' incursions on Apache lands. The two drifters ride into an Apache ambush and they have to fight their way out. Shortly after, they encounter a Cavalry patrol and they inform Captain Gannon about a possible Apache revolt. Captain Gannon is skeptical about it but agrees to allow the two drifters join his column on their way to Apache Wells where the Captain expects a full report from Jim and Bill regarding their incident with the Apaches. Meanwhile, in Apache Wells, the stagecoach lines' regional manager, Hoyt Taylor, is preparing to board the stage for Lordsburg. He is carrying a large sum of money belonging to the stage lines.Aware of this, outlaws Vance Buckner, Jess Cooney and Toby Jack Saunders plan to rob the stagecoach outside the town. Two of them pose as stagecoach passengers while the third plans to join them at the next relay station. Also on the stage is another passenger, Janice MacKenzie, a saloon girl of dubious morals whom the townsfolk have shunned and ordered out of their community. The Cavalry patrol and drifters Jim Walker and Bill Gibson also arrive in town, after being harassed on the way by Apaches. When asked to provide escort to the stagecoach to Lordsburg, Captain Gannon refuses and advises against the voyage, due to concerns over the Apaches but most passengers and the stage line managers insist on making the trip. Last minute, drifters Jim and Bill join the stagecoach and ride shotgun. The perilous voyage to Lordsburg begins. —nufs68 apache wells arizonaapache territoryfort crittenden arizonayuma prisonbutterfield overland mail9 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Killer outlaws ... avenging Apaches ... and the gunslinger who fought them all ! Genre Western Certificate Approved Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia In 1964, it was announced that King Vidor would direct. Goofs At the end of the movie John Russell and Rory Calhoun are fighting. Russell slides down the hill, tearing the right rear of his pants, exposing his underwear. However, as Russell later gets up, his pants are obviously not torn. Quotes Jim Walker: Do you know what the word 'Apache' means? It means enemy. A twenty-four hours a day enemy. An enemy that's anything that walks on two legs. Connections Featured in Farewell: DeForest Kelley--A Tribute (2003) User reviews11 Review Top review 3/10 DeForest Kelley Has Issues Here I've a real affection for the A.C. Lyles westerns which gave employment to a lot of old time players who were finding work increasingly hard to get because of the decline of the studio system and in some cases a refusal to work in television. But Apache Uprising took elements from Stagecoach, Rawhide, Broken Arrow, Coroner Creek, with a little bit of English Gothic thrown in the mix and it didn't come out well. The English Gothic gets into it when the passengers of a stagecoach get held hostage in a relay station by three outlaws, with thunder and lightning flashing outside together with Apaches on the warpath. It comes right out of innumerable old English murder mysteries. Funny thing that with all the old stars like Rory Calhoun, Corinne Calvet, John Russell, Lon Chaney, Jr., Johnny Mack Brown, the one you will remember from this film is DeForest Kelley. The original Star Trek was debuting this year and I'm willing to bet this was Kelley's final work prior to becoming wise old Dr. Leonard McCoy. Toby Jack Saunders is as far from McCoy as you can get. He's reminiscent of the outlaw that Kelley played in The Law and Jake Wade. He's one hateful punk with some serious self esteem issues. I've seen every member of this cast do better work, even better work for A.C. Lyles and it's too bad the film was beneath the talents of all of them. helpful•14 15 bkoganbing Mar 14, 2007 FAQ1 Fine Western cast in horrid screenplay?
