Tired of cookie-cutter law school grads, Harvey takes a gamble by hiring Mike on the spot after recognizing his raw talent and photographic memory. Mike and Harvey are a winning team. Although Mike is a genius, he still has a lot to learn about the law; and while Harvey might seem like an emotionless, cold-blooded shark, Mike's sympathy and concern for their cases and clients will help remind Harvey why he went into law in the first place. Mike's other allies in the office include the firm's best paralegal Rachel and Harvey's no-nonsense assistant Donna. Proving to be an irrepressible duo and invaluable to the practice, Mike and Harvey must keep their secret from everyone including managing partner Jessica and Harvey's arch nemesis Louis, who seems intent on making Mike's life as difficult as possible. —USA Network lawyerphotographic memoryparalegallaw firmnew york city26 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Two lawyers. One degree. (season 1) Genres Comedy Drama Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Stephen Macht (Professor Gerrard) is the real-life father of Gabriel Macht (Harvey Specter). Gabriel Macht's inspiration to become a producer in the series (and take control in areas such as casting department) came when he was watching Sem Saída (2009), a comedy show where the actor and singer Gustavo Goulart is responsible for many departments at the same time. Macht noticed that it gave a special mark to the project, so he decided to take more control of his series too. Quotes Harvey Specter: Anyone can do my job, but no one can be me. Connections Featured in 18th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards (2012) User reviews646 Review Top review 9/10 Just what I was looking for After finishing every available episode of House, Bones, Fringe, and Prison Break, I found myself at a loss of what to watch. So as I was browsing for new TV Shows, I stumbled on this one and decided to give it a go. I am very picky about TV series' but this one really captured me. After not expecting much, it really caught me by surprise how great this was. It reminds me of Law & Order but with more drama and a following into the characters lives. It reminds me of "House" in many ways. It features a strict boss that will do anything to get the job done, and an employee willing to do anything for his boss. It is certainly a new age show that will bring in audience from all ages from teenagers to seniors. I guarantee that you will not be disappointed with this show, as many new shows have disappointed me. helpful•292 66 Aptosblue Jul 20, 2011 FAQ2 Where can I find a song I heard during the show?
