Genres Drama Horror Mystery Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for disturbing violent content and graphic nudity Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia In one shot, corn can be seen with signs of ergot, a hallucinogenic fungus that many attribute to real-life stories of possession and witchcraft. Goofs The desperately poor family is shown eating by the light of multiple candles. Candles were extremely expensive in colonial New England and would have been used very sparingly. Quotes Thomasin: Black Phillip, I conjure thee to speak to me. Speak as thou dost speak to Jonas and Mercy. Dost thou understand my English tongue? Answer me. Black Phillip: What dost thou want? Thomasin: What canst thou give? Black Phillip: Wouldst thou like the taste of butter? A pretty dress? Wouldst thou like to live deliciously? Thomasin: Yes. Black Phillip: Wouldst thou like to see the world? Thomasin: What will you from me? Black Phillip: Dost thou see a book before thee?... Remove thy shift. Thomasin: I cannot write my name. Black Phillip: I will guide thy hand. Connections Featured in Film '72: Episode #45.3 (2016) User reviews1.2K Review Top review 8/10 Great Atmosphere, Great Sound, Different Kind of Movie I found "The Witch" to be a generally unnerving film, and one which--though I would not place it in the pantheon of scariest flicks I've ever seen--had some moments that I'll not easily forget. The atmosphere Eggers creates alone is enough to wrench serious dread from scenes other directors would be otherwise unable to make even remarkable. The score, too, helps cull this dark tone and adds life to a film that can be borderline tedious. That being said, "The Witch" is not for everyone. It is strange, slow but steady, gruesome at points, and almost un-watchable at others. There are two sides to this film; one which I had hoped the director would stick to concerning the family and their struggle with religion and isolation; and another which plays as an undercurrent to most of the film and then takes charge in the end. Sadly, it is this second side which keeps me from giving the film a better score, and that ultimately hurts the film in the very final scene. Overall, I enjoyed "The Witch" and its originality. Eggers has achieved a film that, for all its low-budget and independent film background, feels richer and better made than many horror entries of late. Should you decide to see it, a word of caution: do not expect a fast-paced movie full of jump scares and creepy crawlies emerging left and right. As the opening credits remind the audience, this is a folktale. One that does not shy away from exploring the real dark places. helpful•227 141 my_anywhere Feb 18, 2016 FAQ7 During the exorcist scene, is it the boy talking or is it the witch?
