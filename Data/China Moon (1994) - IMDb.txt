Performed by Anson Funderburgh & The Rockets Featuring Sam Myers Courtesy of Black Top Records User reviews62 Review Top review 7/10 A good way to spend two hours China Moon was unexpectedly good. Whodunits usually aren't my favorites, but this one held my interest. The story has enough going for it to make for a solid mystery. Even though you know who killed whom, you're left second-guessing yourself as to motives and alliances until the very end. There are enough twists and turns to keep you off-balance, but without the story confusion that often accompanies that kind of plot complexity. A surprise final scene provides a satisfying closure. The murder and resulting forensics are on the bloody side, but it's not out of place in the story line. Harris and Stowe turn in believable performances, making for an overall rating of 7 out of 10 stars. helpful•11 0 gastonm Mar 4, 2001 FAQ5 What is 'China Moon' about? Is 'China Moon' based on a book?
