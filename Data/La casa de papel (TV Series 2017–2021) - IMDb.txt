Five months of seclusion memorizing every step, every detail, every probability culminate in eleven days locked up in the National Coinage and Stamp Factory of Spain, surrounded by police forces and with dozens of hostages in their power, to find out whether their suicide wager will lead to everything or nothing. heistrobberyspainmintprofessor25 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Action Crime Drama Mystery Thriller Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The episodes were shot in order and the actors only received the scripts for each episode as they were shooting, so they also did not know what their character's fate would be. Álvaro Morte (The Professor) said the actors would message each other with excitement when they received a new script. Goofs As we do see the character of Mónica Gaztambide in her underwear for most of the first season, it is quite obvious that her underpants change from white to black half-way through the show. Connections Featured in Jeremy Vine: Episode #3.7 (2020) Soundtracks La casa de papel or "My Life Is Going on" Written by Manel Santisteban Performed by Cecilia Krull User reviews3.3K Review Top review 9/10 Extremely Good Could not stop watching this series. What an excellent set of actors fully into their roles in a natural way. Refreshing storyline unlike most other movies or series about bank robberies. Can't wait for season two helpful•287 189 tenhovehans Dec 28, 2017 FAQ4 Why does IMDb list only 9 episodes in Season 1, while Netflix clearly lists 13 for Part 1? Are there different subtitle versions for English? The one I'm watching is very poor. The English audio soundtrack is much more accurate. The trouble is the English soundtrack sounds so artificial, like all soundtracks.Despite not understanding a word Spanish I found the English/Swedish subtitles easier to comprehend if I paid attention to the way the actors spoke in Spanish. Using the dubbed English sound didn't work at all. A lot got lost in translation.
