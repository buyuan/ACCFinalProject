Genres Action Crime Drama Sci-Fi Thriller Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia In the '90s, Quentin Tarantino wanted to make "Luke Cage: Hero for Hire" into a film, with Laurence Fishburne in the title role, but opted to make "Pulp Fiction (1994)" instead. Goofs The thumb drive that Luke Cage gives Claire, which has Reva's data on it, is a different one than the one given to him by Jessica Jones (and also shown earlier in the Luke Cage series), which is bright yellow in color and has rounded edges. Quotes Luke Cage: [after being shot at] I'm about sick of always having to buy new clothes. Crazy credits The first season has its episode titles named after a Gang Starr song. The second season has its episode titles named after a Pete Rock-C.L. Smooth song.

Method Man User reviews387 Review Top review 9/10 Not Luke warm Well for some it was I reckon, but it is tough to please everyone anyway, so this being different is either good or bad. Connected with the other shows on Netflix, this also works as stand alone, even if people from the other shows pop up (look for a timeline to watch the shows if you care, because there are some consequences that are being carried over too). The show itself has a lot of cool music, some cameos (to name but one let's take Method Man who also has a speaking role besides blessing us with his lyrical skills) and a lot of action too. I am not so familiar with the comics, so I can't really compare or tell you what the differences are if there are any. I can tell you that the plot seems unpredictable and there are quite a few twists that I did not expect myself. Very cool actors involved (all the shows have cool people in them) and while it is not without flaws and I initially thought about going with an 8 rating, having Rakim as a bookend performer to the show made me just incredibly happy! Arguably one of the best MCs (no offense KRS-One, also in performing in season 2), if not the best. The show finds an abrupt end overall, though it can be called satisfying - production values are immense to say the least and amazing too. Top notch production with a very charismatic lead actor helpful•9 1 kosmasp Sep 11, 2020 Details Edit Release date September 30, 2016 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Official Facebook Official site Languages English Spanish Polish Also known as Marvel's Luke Cage Filming locations New York City, New York, USA Production companies ABC Television Studio Disney-ABC Domestic Television Marvel Entertainment See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 55 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 1.78 : 1 Related news Mahershala Ali Limited Series ‘The Plot’ Draws Multiple Bidders (Exclusive) Nov 5Variety Film + TV Billy Preston Getting Docu Film Treatment In Paris Barclay-Helmed Film From White Horse & Homegrown Pictures Nov 4Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
