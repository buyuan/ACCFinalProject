Villanelle is a talented killer, who clings to the luxuries her violent job affords her. These two fierce women, equally obsessed with each other, will go head to head in an epic game of cat and mouse, toppling the typical spy-action thriller. dark comedybisexualitylesbian attractionfemale assassinprison22 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Action Adventure Drama Thriller Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Jodie Comer had been carousing with friends at a music festival in Barcelona (Spain), and nursing a hangover, when she got the call to audition with Sandra Oh in Los Angeles. Despite feeling her chances of landing the part were slim at best, she took a 13-hour flight to L.A. and after 5 minutes in reading with Sandra, the pair clicked. Quotes [from a promotional trailer] Villanelle: You should never call a psychopath a psychopath. It upsets them. Connections Featured in WatchMojo: Top 10 Best TV Shows of 2018 (So Far) (2018) User reviews892 Review Top review 10/10 Psych Thriller I love the show. INTRIGUING! Someone wrote that this was sloppy writing because there is no background on the characters. That's not true, if you pay attention you have everything you need. Eve is a MI5 investigator but she longs for more in her life, something trilling and something that gets her heart thumping. She secretly loves psychopaths, she wants to know how they work and why. It's a hobby of hers. Villanelle is the psychopath. She has sociopathic tendencies. She mimics emotions because she has no empathy and we see her continuing to adapt to her surroundings (smiling with the child in the ice cream shop, laughing like the lady on the radio). That's what is odd and interesting about her character. Her drive is to kill people because she easily becomes bored with every day mundane tasks. They will become each others next obsession! helpful•349 116 tgp0210 Apr 16, 2018 FAQ3 Will Killing Eve be available on Netflix Canada? Season 1 is being re-shown as 'Bonus Edition's. It looks like the episodes are longer. What's the difference - what's been added?
