He is respected by his superiors for his incredible surgical skills, envied by his peers and he is engaged to the daughter of the hospital director. But one day his bright future changes when a little boy is brought in with a serious head injury, along with his twin sister, the aftermath of a family massacre. He is faced with a huge dilemma when his superior orders him to abort the boy's surgery and operate on the mayor instead, who was brought in much later. He decides that "all life is equal" and goes against his superiors to save the boy's life (who arrived first), which ultimately results in the mayor's death. The boy survives, leaving Tenma's career in ruins, his engagement to his fiancé broken. His downward spiral begins when one night, while he is out cold in a drunken stupor, the twins vanish from the hospital and Tenma's superiors - along with the hospital director - are found dead. Tenma, having no alibi and the only one with motive, is the prime murder suspect. He goes into hiding and vows to find the twins and prove his innocence. Little did he know, that this is only the beginning of a terrifying journey through countries, buried secrets and the dark depths of the human psyche... —Playbahnosh nihilismanimeevil mangood versus evilgenocide135 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Animation Crime Drama Mystery Thriller Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Dr. Reichwein's files on patients (seen when he looks for Richard's) include files on "supposed" patients named Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders (as "Wilhelm E.

Connections Remade as Monster Soundtracks For the Love of Life Performed by David Sylvian User reviews116 Review Top review A fantastic anime that not only gets away with taking itself far to serious - but creates one of the most entertaining shows of any type I've ever seen by doing this. A dark, suspenseful and extremely entertaining anime that boldly answers back to the skeptics who think that all anime must be as brain-dead and child-oriented as the majority of prime-time viewing. (Which is, quite frankly, usually embarrassing to watch in the presence of others.) The plot of Monster is without a doubt the best part, dark but not without cheerful scenes, and centered around the story of a Dr. Tenma, a talented Nero-surgeon, who's upright morals soon send him on a rarely chosen path to correct the wrong he'd unwittingly committed in the name of justice. Unlike other anime, most of which seem to focus on super-powers, fantasy, or sci-fi horror, this one's true chillingness is in the fact that despite being animated, it is portrayed in an all-too-real manner. In reality, the most truly terrifying people are generally people who you wouldn't think out of the ordinary in a crowd, not some supernatural monster who relies on brute force or the inability of the entire world he fights to stop him. The animation isn't the best, but the story more then makes up for it, and even watching it on a 42" TV, I was far to engrossed with the story to make more then the occasional observation that perhaps the movement wasn't quite as smooth in some places as it might be. The same applies to the sound, which doesn't quite keep pace with the story either. Nonetheless, it is one of the best shows I've seen, period. helpful•61 7 benthebrat Apr 10, 2005 Details Edit Release date April 6, 2004 (Japan) Country of origin Japan Official sites NTV (Japan) VAP (Japan) Languages English Japanese Also known as Monštrum Production companies Madhouse Shogakukan Production Video Audio Project (VAP) See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 24 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 1.33 : 1 Related news The 5 Weirdest Super Hero Adaptations Ever Oct 27Cinelinx Mindy Newell: Days Of Yore Sep 11Comicmix.com Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
