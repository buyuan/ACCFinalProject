Connections Features Bobby (1973) User reviews5 Review Top review 10/10 Historic hit Godfather was the third directorial venture of successful duo Siddique-Lal after surprise hit ramji rao speaking and cult blockbuster in harihar Nagar. It marked the silver screen debut of legendary theatre artist N.N. Pilla as Anjooran. Godfather narrates the story of two rival families Anjooran and Aanapara. Problems arise when Anjooran's son ramabhadran and Aanapara girl Malu fall in love with each other. Reading this, you may wonder this is another Romeo-Juliet story but no. Even though the story is melodramatic, siddique lal gives this with their signature humour touch. Each and every comedy scene of this film is afresh in malayalee audience in mind. Though mukesh is the hero, it's the supporting cast pilla, innocent, jagadeesh, philomina etc who dominate the film. Godfather is the longest running Malayalam film ever. It ran for 400 days breaking the record of Mohanlal's Chitram. Godfather is my favorite Siddique Lal movie. helpful•0 0 vjnambu Dec 12, 2018 Details Edit Release date November 15, 1991 (India) Country of origin India Language Malayalam Also known as Крестный отец Production company Swargachitra See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 2 hours 30 minutes Color Color Related news Nicolas Cage Appreciation Society: Best Of Times (1981) Jan 13Nerdly ‘King Richard’ Finds Its Young Venus & Serena, Adds Aunjanue Ellis To Will Smith-Starring Warner Bros.
