Personal Quote: When I entered this business I think people looked at me and said, 'Here's a young, good-looking guy. He should play the romantic lead.' So I played the jock, I played those parts, and it was a good thing. But, over time, as I've gotten older, I realize I have a lot more fun as an actor when I'm doing other things. The more character-driven the role, the better. See more » Trivia: Graduated from Putnam City North High School (located in Oklahoma City) class of 1991.
