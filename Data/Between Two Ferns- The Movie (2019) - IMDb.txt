But when Will Ferrell discovered his public access TV show "Between Two Ferns" and uploaded it to Funny or Die, Zach became a viral laughing stock. Now Zach and his crew are taking a road trip to complete a series of high-profile celebrity interviews and restore his reputation. Directed by Scott Aukerman, BETWEEN TWO FERNS: THE MOVIE is a laugh-out-loud comedy that gives new insight into the curmudgeonly, beloved outsider Zach Galifianakis has created over the years. —Netflix celebrity guestroad tripinterviewcelebritycomedian Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines There's nowhere he won't go. Genre Comedy Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia This is the second time Jon Hamm is interviewed on Between Two Ferns. The first time (in 2010) the chyron says "Jon Ham, Actor, The Mad Men " Goofs When John Legend sprays Zach in the face with mace, his own face is less than a foot away. At that range the mace would have blown back into his own face and heavily affected him. Quotes Self - Host: Little trivia about my show: I originally wanted to call it Betwixt Two Ferns, but I thought that was too highbrow for the public. Connections Referenced in Lights Out with David Spade: Episode #1.9 (2019) Soundtracks Taxi Driver - Theme From feature film Taxi Driver (1976) Written by Bernard Herrmann User reviews214 Review Top review 6/10 Did not live up to the expectations, but still pretty fun. Long time fan of the original show online and had high hopes for this after the trailer. The story and some jokes seemed really predictable, but they were still fun nonetheless. The run time of only 75 minutes helps the movie not get boring as it is paced pretty fast. The celebrity interactions are the strongest point imo, but they felt rushed because of the fact that each celebrity was there for like 2 minutes at a time. Overall, if you are a fan of the show, you should give it a try and see what you think. If you've never seen or dislike the original, then this is definitely not for you. helpful•48 13 farik23 Sep 20, 2019 Details Edit Release date September 20, 2019 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Giữa Khóm Dương Xỉ: Bản Điện Ảnh Filming locations 10825 Sepulveda Blvd, Mission Hills, California, USA Production company Funny or Die See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 22 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 2.00 : 1 Related news Ozy Studios Hires Duo Of Executives, Three Executive Producers To Boost Development & Production Apr 9Deadline Film + TV Brie Larson to star in Apple TV series ‘Lessons in Chemistry’ Jan 25HeyUGuys.co.uk Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Between Two Ferns: The Movie (2019) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
