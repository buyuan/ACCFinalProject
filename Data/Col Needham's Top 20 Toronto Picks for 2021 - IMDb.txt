The list is in alphabetical order as it hard enough to pick only 20, let alone rank them! Unfortunately due to the pandemic I am unable to travel to Toronto so I will be watching virtually from home again. The scope of the festival and the quality makes it difficult to select 20 and these are all taken from my longer TIFF Interest List which contains nearly 100 movies.
