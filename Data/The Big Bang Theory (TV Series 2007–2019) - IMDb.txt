They are colleagues, best friends, and roommates, although in all capacities their relationship is always tested primarily by Sheldon's regimented, deeply eccentric, and non-conventional ways. They are also friends with their Cal Tech colleagues mechanical engineer Howard Wolowitz and astrophysicist Rajesh Koothrappali. The foursome spend their time working on their individual work projects, playing video games, watching science-fiction movies, or reading comic books. As they are self-professed nerds, all have little or no luck with women. When Penny, a pretty woman and an aspiring actress from Omaha, moves into the apartment across the hall from Leonard and Sheldon's, Leonard has another aspiration in life, namely to get Penny to be his girlfriend. —Huggo nerdgeek culturefriendroommatebest friend63 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Smart Is The New Sexy. Genres Comedy Romance Certificate (Banned) Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Most of the time, Leonard (Johnny Galecki) has no lenses in his glasses. Goofs In one episode, Sheldon states that pets are banned under the roommate agreement, but in another he adopts 25 cats. But it's regularly shown that Sheldon uses the roommate agreement to his own advantage, sometimes unaware, but more often completely ignoring, how it affects Leonard. Quotes [repeated line when someone accuses Sheldon of being crazy] Sheldon: I'm not crazy. My mother had me tested! Crazy credits One of the final cards to appear in the credit sequence is the vanity card for Chuck Lorre Productions. In keeping with his practice on Dharma & Greg (1997) and Two and a Half Men (2003), there is a different message on the card each week, written by Chuck Lorre himself.

Tuesdays are spent anxiously awaiting its posting on iTunes so I can download it, as I live in Canada & don't have cable. TBBT is a trip down memory lane for me, as it IS my high school experience (20+ years ago, I was a smarter Penny). I love the characters, especially Leonard who is adorable, and the smarmy yet surprisingly charming Wolowitz. It has the feel of "Frasier Goes To College". I do agree though that they should lose the laugh track - annoying, but not enough to make me stop watching. BTW, very smart of CBS to originally have offered the pilot as a free download or I would never have given it a look. Now I'm an addict! helpful•177 127 slr_imaging Oct 16, 2007 FAQ15 Why does Apple logo on Macbook (owned by Raj) and Mac (owned by Amy) are not clearly revealing but Dell logo (or name) is clear on laptops? Who portrays Howards mother when she is shown onscreen? What is on the wall to the left of the entryway to the bedrooms? It looks like a series of On/Off Switches.
