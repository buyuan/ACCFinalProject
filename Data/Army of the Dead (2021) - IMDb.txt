For the time being, his mountains of cash are safe behind his impenetrable casino vault; however, the US President plans to nuke the entire city in less than 96 hours. Now, Tanaka is willing to pay $50 million to the decorated former mercenary, Scott Ward, and his hand-picked team to retrieve the money before the bomb obliterates the city. Indeed, this is a life-changing offer Scott cannot refuse; nevertheless, the rules have changed, and the horde of the walking undead seems to be more organised than they might have expected. But, time is running out.
