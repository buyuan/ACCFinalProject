A rock band that can only schedule a performance at the local aquarium, is run by an eager and overambitious New Zealand buddy, and has only one fan. —swansongang new zealandnew york citydeadpangoofballsong16 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Born to folk!

Quotes Jemaine: It doesn't matter what country someone's from, or what they look like, or the colour of their skin. It doesn't matter what they smell like, or that they spell words slightly differently-some would say, more correctly. I'm a person. Bret's a person. You're a person. That person over there is a person. And each person deserves to be treated like a person. Connections Featured in The 60th Primetime Emmy Awards (2008) User reviews44 Review Top review 8/10 Not Serious, Not Controversial, but Really Funny! This show stars two characters Bret, and Jermaine who have traveled from New Zealand to New York City in order to make their band "Flight of the Conchords" the next big thing. They are managed by a fellow New Zealander Murray, who really works for the NZ consulate in the US, but runs the band on the side, constantly failing to get them "gigs". Through interactions with Americans who almost always confuse them with Brits, an obsessed fan who is constantly stalking them, a buddy with a paintball gun, and a girlfriend who likes guys who are in a band, this show has some seriously funny moments. This show is full of humor that might make you think a little bit, but at the same time, you're hit with an occasional comment that makes you laugh, not laugh out loud, but you're just like haha, that was pretty funny. If you're a fan of Laugh out loud comedy where the jokes don't make you think a little bit, then stay away. This show isn't complex by any means, but it attempts to give you a subtle humor that some run away from. This show isn't the greatest thing to ever hit television, but if you're looking for a solid 30 minutes of entertainment, then tune in. I give it a very above average 8 out of 10, because it never fails to make you laugh, but at the same time, it's not the greatest show ever made. helpful•75 45 smitty_cregger52 Jul 9, 2007 Details Edit Release date June 17, 2007 (United States) Countries of origin United States New Zealand Official site HBO (United States) Language English Also known as 痞客二人組 Filming locations New York City, New York, USA Production companies Dakota Pictures Home Box Office (HBO) See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 28 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 1.78 : 1 Related news Watch out for ‘The White Lotus’ scene stealer Murray Bartlett at the SAG Awards Nov 8Gold Derby Taika Waititi Directing Movie Adaptation of ‘The Incal’ Graphic Novel Nov 4Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Spanish language plot outline for Flight of the Conchords (2007)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
