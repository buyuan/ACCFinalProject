Filming would start early in the dawn, around 5 AM, and wrap up by about 11 AM, in order to capture the scenes in a dreamy atmosphere; the cast and crew had to arrive on location one hour before filming. In addition, an ice machine was brought from Madras to provide any additional mist if the shot didn't look romantic enough. Goofs In the song Om Namaha, that was done in a single long shot (YouTube/online versions do not show this in a single shot as in the original release), you can see a fly in the latter part of the song (right shoulder of the hero). Connections Referenced in Neninthe (2008) Soundtracks Jallanta Kavvinta Kaavaalil Sung by S.P. Balasubrahmanyam, K.S. Chithra and S. Janaki Composed by Ilaiyaraaja (as Ilyaraja) Lyrics by Veturi Sundararamamurthy User reviews14 Review Top review 10/10 Heart Touching I Like ManiRtanams movies But Geetanjali is something different and its a class of its own in the sense even if you see after 15-20 yrs its still looks fresh story. all the characters Justified it. They are lively and well suited. Ilayaraja supplimented this with excellent music. Girija acting in her first movie was the center of attraction as she suited for the role and acted very professionally. I wonder not to see her again in films. Nagarjuna did his job perfectly but the credit goes to the director who portrayed these roles and refined them. Hats Off Mani Sir. Expecting more from you like these classics. helpful•0 0 vivekdatla Apr 17, 2006 Details Edit Release date May 19, 1989 (India) Country of origin India Language Telugu Also known as Гитанджали Filming locations Ooty, Tamil Nadu, India Production company Bhagyalakshmi Enterprises See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 2 hours 30 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news Rakul Preet Singh to play weightlifter Karnam Malleswari in biopic?
