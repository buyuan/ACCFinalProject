Goofs When Ava has put on clothes/"skin", her breasts become notably smaller. Quotes Nathan: One day the AIs are going to look back on us the same way we look at fossil skeletons on the plains of Africa. An upright ape living in dust with crude language and tools, all set for extinction. Crazy credits The end credits starts with a single dot in the background which then grows and various patterns emerge from it. Alternate versions The alternatively censored cut released in China featured frequent blurs of nudity and, on occasion, violence. One scene towards the end also seemed to be zoomed for no apparent reason. Connections Featured in Film '72: Episode #44.2 (2015) Soundtracks Schubert Piano Sonata No.21 in B Flat Major, D.960 Composed by Franz Schubert Performed by Alfred Brendel Courtesy of Decca Under license from Universal Music Operations Limited User reviews1K Review Top review 10/10 Writer Director Alex Garland is a powerhouse of talent I rarely do this because there is so much rubbish out there but I'm going to recommend a movie. Writer Director Alex Garland has done an amazing job, it's beautifully shot, fantastically lit, intelligently written, brilliantly cast. the edit is original and brave, as is the direction of the edit, There is nothing superfluous, to the contrary it' has a sharp Zen like quality, clearly the application of a disciplined mind. The movie is's self is engaging, thoroughly watchable, the characters are simple and yet layered with complexity. The film strikes the perfect balance of not spoon feeding and not dumbing down but not being too arty or intellectual just for the sake of it. Best seen in a cinema I reckon. helpful•378 197 chriscrudelli-220-144403 Jan 24, 2015 FAQ6 Is this based on the anime/comic/RPG of the same name? What does the title "Ex Machina" mean ?
