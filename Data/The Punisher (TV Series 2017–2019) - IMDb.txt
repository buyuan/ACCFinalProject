(2013)" by Skye as a hacker in the Rising Tide group, and later in "Daredevil (2015)" as a disc with his name on it. Goofs In every scene in the tent in Afghanistan, the flag is hanging backwards. When hanging, the stars should always be in the top, left corner. However in a war zone this is normal. Quotes Frank Castle: One Batch, Two Batch, Penny and Dime. Connections Featured in WatchMojo: Top 10 Brutal Fight Scenes on TV (2018) User reviews809 Review Top review 9/10 So much better than I expected I really liked this show. I am not a comic book fan, but somehow found myself sucked in to Daredevil. It sux hard that Netflix cancelled all their Marvil shows. Anyway, the Punisher was a great character on Daredevil, and despite some bad reviews, we gave the show a chance. We were really surprised how much we liked it. My husband likes it much more than Daredevil. It isn't as much of a comic book show as the other. Despite lower reviews for season 2, I really liked both seasons. With so much crap on Netflix these days, it's hard for me to understand why they didn't fight harder to keep their Marvel Shows. I've heard Disney will reboot Daredevil for their streaming channel or for Hulu. But what's the point of remaking it with new actors when we love the show already? I doubt Punisher will have any chance for reboot or continuation. Very disappointing! helpful•77 14 belleverite33626 Jun 14, 2019 Details Edit Release date November 17, 2017 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Instagram Official Facebook Language English Also known as Marvel's The Punisher Filming locations Clinton Diner, Maspeth, Queens, New York City, New York, USA Production companies ABC Signature Disney-ABC Domestic Television Marvel Entertainment See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 53 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Related news Dolph Lundgren Executive Producing Documentary About Himself (Exclusive) Nov 16Variety Film + TV ‘City On A Hill’: Corbin Bernsen, Joanne Kelly, Ernie Hudson Join Showtime Drama Series As Recurring Nov 12Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
