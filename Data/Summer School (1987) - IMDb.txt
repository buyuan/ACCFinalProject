Teacher. Genres Comedy Romance Certificate PG-13 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia On Shoop's left hand, you can see that he has injured one of his fingers and it appears to have been smashed. This occurred when Mark Harmon had to actually put out the fire on the couch during the party scene that grew quickly out of control. Goofs When Rhonda stands up during first roll call and pats her pregnant stomach, the echo of the ball under her shirt is audible. Quotes Chainsaw: You passed and I failed! You asshole! How could you do that to me? Dave: It was an accident. I'll take it again. I can fail, I know I can. Alternate versions The UK VHS version was cut by 48 secs by the BBFC to remove all footage of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974). This film was banned on video at the time and so no footage could be included. Connections Featured in The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson: Mark Harmon/Barry Sobel/Charles Batton (1987) Soundtracks Happy by Oingo Boingo Written and Performed by Danny Elfman User reviews83 Review Top review There Is Just Something About This Film "Summer School" is a prime example of a film that over-achieves. It appears to be a typical teen comedy, but its screenplay is so smart that it is hard dislike. Carl Reiner's direction is substantial as he never tries to make the film more than it is. Mark Harmon does some of the best work of his ho-hum career as a high school physical education instructor who must teach a group of lazy students who all have more personality than brains. Kirstie Alley stars as the next-door teacher who teaches Harmon a few things about education. All of the students have their moments as well. However, it is Dean Cameron as "Chainsaw" who steals every scene and makes the film fun throughout. A strange over-achiever. 3.5 out of 5 stars. helpful•14 4 tfrizzell Nov 4, 2000 Details Edit Release date July 22, 1987 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Літня школа Filming locations Charles Evans Hughes Jr. High School - 5607 Capistrano, Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California, USA Production company Paramount Pictures See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross US & Canada $35,659,098 Opening weekend US & Canada $6,012,274 Jul 26, 1987 Gross worldwide $35,659,098 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 37 minutes Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news HBO Max New Releases: November 2021 Nov 1Den of Geek New on HBO Max in November 2021 Oct 25Gold Derby Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Summer School (1987) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
