Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Documentary Short Action Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Add content advisory User reviews2 Review Top review 10/10 Rated R for Violence Lets face it, no one watches this for the ecomedy. This is a graphical masterpiece that embraces its R rating perfectly. I love it. The ending leaves room for a sequil and promises further world building data. John wick finds himself at a cross-roads. I am looking forward to the next one. This is by far my favorite action flick. helpful•0 0 molobelalesedi Nov 4, 2021 Details Edit Release date April 28, 2019 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site HBO streaming link Language English Production companies Home Box Office (HBO) Lionsgate See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 13 minutes Color Color Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
