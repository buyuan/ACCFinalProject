Protectors of peace. Jean Grey is one of the most beloved X-Men. But when a mission goes wrong, Jean is exposed to a dark and ancient power. This power has destroyed everything it comes in contact with, until her. Now that this power is becoming unstable, she releases it with destruction and anger. Now that this foreign power is consuming her, and the world is threatened, the X-Men have to face an important truth: they must save either the world, or their friend who threatens it. year 1975year 1992alienmind controldirectorial debut336 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines A Phoenix will rise. The X-Men will fall. Genres Action Adventure Sci-Fi Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action including some gunplay, disturbing images, and brief strong language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia (at around 24 mins) The mutant singing during the mutant school party is Alison Blaire a.k.a. Dazzler, played by Halston Sage. She is a mutant from the comics who can change sound into light, a talent she used to further her pop-singer career. This was the character's cinematic debut. Goofs The film is set in 1992, 30 years after the events of X: First Class (2011), yet the characters have barely aged during the intervening years. A few mutants have anti-aging abilities, but not all of them. This movie is set in an alternate timeline, so all continuity errors are justified. Quotes Professor Charles Xavier: The mind is a fragile thing. Takes only the slightest tap to tip it in the wrong direction. Crazy credits When the 20th Century Fox logo fades away, the X in the logo stays for a second longer before it also fades away.

This is not Endgame so please stop comparing this to it, giving it low scores because you liked that better. Ive seen every XMen flick to date and this one is on par with most and superior to Apocalypse. The mood is dark, serious, moody no Marvel kiddie jokes every 5 mins. Action is top notch. Magneto needs his own film. helpful•70 44 Theedg3 Oct 20, 2019 FAQ3 Why do none of the main characters appear to have aged despite decades passing since they first appeared in-universe? What would be the best order to watch this and the other X-Men movies? How did Jean merge with the Phoenix Force in space when she previously manifested its power in "X-Men: Apocalypse"?
