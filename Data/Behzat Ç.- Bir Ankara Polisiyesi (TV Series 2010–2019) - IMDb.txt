Through this series I liked Ankara. Behzat Ç is a rough, violent and morally ambiguous police officer who is the head of the homicide department in Ankara. Behzat Ç and his team usually work together with the public prosecutor Esra, who later becomes his love interest. I wish though that all police officers. A series of very sincere. All the characters in the series so good. They complement each other. Array doing different from other series. 'La' word stuck in my mouth. Unfortunately, the series it was finished. I wish I had not been this way. Very more should be done like this series. It became one of the series will not be forgotten. So at least for me... 10/10 helpful•48 4 ahmetkozan Mar 28, 2016 Details Edit Release date September 19, 2010 (Turkey) Country of origin Turkey Official sites Facebook Official Blu TV Language Turkish Also known as Behzat Ç. an Ankara Detective Story Filming locations Ankara, Turkey Production companies Adam Film Inter Medya See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 30 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 16:9 HD 4:3 Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the English language plot outline for Behzat Ç.: Bir Ankara Polisiyesi (2010)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
