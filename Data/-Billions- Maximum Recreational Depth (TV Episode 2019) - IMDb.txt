Plot summary Add synopsis Genre Drama Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia The secret Wall Street society which "Wags" is invited to join - Kappa Beta Phi - really exists. And, its new members really do dress in drag. Quotes Chuck Rhoades: Digital coins you have been offering. Forgive me if I don't understand all the peculiarities of cybercurrency but without your bank knowing it you've been using its reputation to burnish these ICO scams and selling them to customers when you know damn well the coins are worthless even if they exist in the first place. You know, I guess I do understand after all because for all the ICO mumbo jumbo what we have here is an old fashioned pig-in-a-poke. Soundtracks Dangerous Performed by Fred Eaglesmith User reviews1 Review Top review 10/10 Maximum recreational depth . Another brilliantly written and acted episode of Billions. With Axe and company plotting to destroy Taylor and her father, Chuck is back to his guilty pleasures. Chuck is regaining power, but with it comes a familiar foe sitting in his old seat trying to take him down. This episode had a lot going on, but as usual it is a controlled chaos. Everything at its right time for the perfect amount of time so it all flows together brilliantly. I just can't give enough praise to the writing, and excellent acting that comes with each episode. There is going to be a whole lot of action coming in the 2nd half of season 4 !! helpful•15 4 mpboylanjr-54038 Apr 22, 2019 Details Edit Release date April 21, 2019 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Filming locations New York, USA Production companies Showtime Networks Best Available!
