Genres Comedy Romance Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia All of Lyndsy Fonseca and David Henrie's scenes as Ted (Josh Radnor)'s future children were filmed during the first season to keep them the same age throughout the series. This includes a scene for the show's eventual final episode filmed early in the second season. Goofs Marshall, Lily, and Ted went to Wesleyan, where Ted studied to be an architect, but Wesleyan does not have an architecture program. Quotes Barney: It's gonna be legen... wait for it... dary! Connections Featured in The 59th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards (2007) Soundtracks Hey Beautiful Written by The Solids Performed by The Solids User reviews881 Review Top review Good laugh for late twenty-somethings I've enjoyed the first few episodes of this post "Friends" comedy. It really captures some of the humorous albeit awkward situations that late twenty-somethings are finding themselves in these days. Alyson Hannigan once again presents her hilarious, quirky sense of style and humor. Along with her boyfriend, Marshall, they are an excellent representation of the couple who are trying to figure out an identity in the "not still partying like college kids, but trying not to be all grown up" stage of life. The lead character, Ted, provides great entertainment. Audiences will be drawn in by his sensitivity and likability. He's not desperate to get married, but merely ready to find the One, tired of game playing. Overall, I think this is a half-hour well spent. The humor is edgy, unpredictable, and you will find yourself reminiscing about those first few years after you graduated from college and struggled to find yourself out in the "Real World." helpful•245 83 kasiemahan Nov 8, 2005 FAQ27 What's the theme song and who performs it? What songs are featured on the show? Are the kids actually Ted's?
