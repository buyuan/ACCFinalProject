Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Rose Byrne and Bobby Cannavale are a real life couple. Goofs When Jake and Justine take Teddy for swimming classes the first time, Miss Jenn (swimming instructor) throws a blue colored toy float towards Jake as a sarcasm for his fear of cold water. In the next scene we see that toy float between open arms of Jenn instead of being near Jake or Teddy. Quotes Blanca: Do you always bring your pregnant sister on dates? Jake: Just when I want to guarantee I won't get laid.

Adult Beginners' plot: After becoming a pariah to just about everyone he's connected with after a failed product launch, self-centred entrepreneur Jake (played by stand-up comic Nick Kroll) returns to his childhood home where his sister, Justine (played by Rose Byrne), and brother-in-law, Danny (played by Bobby Cannavale), live with their three-year-old son. As Jake licks his wounds and contemplates his next step, he comes to appreciate the value of family and the virtue of humility. Kroll would seem to be an unlikely candidate to play a character who rediscovers their humanity in a comedic film with touchy feely leanings like Adult Beginners, considering the abrasive nature of his stand-up act and his television roles on The League and Kroll Show. His snide personality is intact initially, mind you, but that edge is gradually dulled as Jake is welcomed into his sister's home and takes on the nanny responsibilities for his nephew. The fish-out-of-water scenario rarely yields impactful results, however, be they of the moving or comedic variety, and the movie rarely goes anywhere you're not expecting it to. Kroll acquits himself decently with the limited material, as do Byrne and Cannavale, who are given their own marital issues to wrestle with as a subplot. Peripheral characters played by Jane Krakowski, Josh Charles, Paula Garces, and Joel McHale barely register, although one scene with Saturday Night Live's Bobby Moynihan playing a former classmates of Jake's delivers the movie's best laughs and will ring true for anyone who's had one of those run-ins with someone from your past that you wouldn't even want as a Facebook friend. Adult Beginners disappoints with its skimpy joke-to-laugh ratio and ability to move the viewer with Jake's transformation, adding up to a slight movie that's unlikely to stay with you for very long. helpful•33 10 MediaboyMusings Sep 17, 2014 Details Edit Release date April 24, 2015 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Official Facebook Language English Also known as Yetişkin Çaylaklar Filming locations New York, USA Production companies Burn Later Productions Duplass Brothers Productions Through Films See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross US & Canada $108,808 Opening weekend US & Canada $36,657 Apr 26, 2015 Gross worldwide $108,808 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 32 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news HBO Max New Releases: November 2021 Nov 1Den of Geek New on HBO Max in November 2021 Oct 25Gold Derby Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Adult Beginners (2014) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
