India is a potent blend of old and new. Tradition jostles with modern aspirations against the backdrop of a Big Fat Indian Wedding revealing many secrets and many lies. The supposedly liberal fabric of the upper crust unravels as the duo navigate through arranged marriages, dowry transactions and virginity tests. web seriesweddingwedding plannersrich peoplegrey characters10 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Drama Romance Certificate Not Rated Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Arjun Mathur was nominated for the best actor in the 2020 International Emmys for this series. User reviews231 Review Top review 9/10 I don't understand why series has to be relatable to be good? I love Zoya's work. It's a different concept that people aren't used to in India. People want violence and abusive language for selling. This is a very unique concept with good characters and the direction of scenes and wedding scenes are amazing. Story is engaging and you should give it a shot. helpful•39 10 dewamshah Mar 8, 2019 Details Edit Release date March 8, 2019 (India) Country of origin India Official site Amazon Prime Video Languages Hindi English Also known as Сделано на небесах Production companies Excel Entertainment Tiger Baby Films See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 50 minutes Related news ‘The Archies’ is Zoya Akhtar and Reema Kagti’s first independent production Nov 13GlamSham Netflix signs production deal with India’s Excel Entertainment Sep 1ScreenDaily Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Italian language plot outline for Made in Heaven (2019)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode Most anticipated Indian movies and shows Percentage shows amount of top page views. 1Marakkar: Lion of the Arabian Sea38.6% 2Ram Asur24.7% 3Bunty Aur Babli 28.3% 4RRR5.6% 5Antim: The Final Truth5.0% 6Matsya Kaand4.4% 7Pushpa: The Rise - Part 14.4% 8Satyameva Jayate 23.6% 9Dangerous2.9% 10Minnal Murali2.6% Updates approximately every 20 minutes.
