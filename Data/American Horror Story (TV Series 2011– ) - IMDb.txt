Baldini's work led to the closure of Pennhurst and the release of all of its patients. Pennhurst is now the location of a seasonal haunted house and has been featured on numerous shows, due to the reported extreme paranormal activity in Pennhurst's buildings. Goofs Frances Conroy ("Old" Moira O'Hara) is right-eye dominant. Many times you can see that she, as Moira, is focusing on the object she's looking at using her "blind" right eye instead of her left eye. Quotes Cordelia Foxx: In the absence of the council, as reigning Supreme of this coven, I hereby decree... for the murders of our sister witch, Cecily Pembroke and our college, Quentin Fleming... you... Myrtle Snow, are hereby sentenced to death by fire. Myrtle Snow: Delia, my sweet daughter, I have never been more proud. Cordelia Foxx: Any last words? Myrtle Snow: Only one. BALENCIAGA!

Season 1 (murder house) 9.5/10 One of the most entertaining and creepy seasons I have ever watched tate and violet were great characters and so was Jessica Lange's character this season was brilliant. Season 2 (asylum) 9.5/10 Absolutely loved this season. A very weird season with aliens, the devil, a angel, and some very twisted nuns. I feel like the ending definitely could have been better but other than that this season really didn't disappoint. Season 3 (coven) 9.3/10 Is a great season ! Tarissa farmiga and Evan peters really didn't disappoint. I loved every minute of this season and it is one of my favourites Season 4 (freak show) 7.7/10 This season was a step down but still really entertaining Emma roberts character was a let down and I didn't like a lot of the characters. I did love the fact pepper returned and Finn witrocks performance was excellent. This season had one of the best endings but overall wasn't the best season Season 5 (hotel) 8.8/10 I know a lot of people didn't enjoy this season but I found it really great. The first few episodes were a big let down but the rest was excellent. Evan peters character was really well acted and I really enjoyed lady gaga's character. Season 6 (Roanoke) I honestly couldn't watch this season. I watched the first few episodes and it was a big disappointment.from what I've saw I'd give it a 5.0/10 Season 7 (cult) 8.3/10 There is a lot of controversy on this season but I thought it was great. The first 4 or 5 episodes aren't great but I really enjoyed the rest. Its got a crazy ending and in my opinion Evan peters deserved a Emmy for his performance as Kai Season 8 (apocalypse) 9.0/10 Absolutely brilliant! The return of one of the best seasons, coven and murder house, and they handled it great unlike a lot of shows returning something would do. Evan peters character was a let down because it was a very average character and was only in a few episodes, except for his performance as tate Langton, this was one of the best seasons and didn't fail to entertain me. On of the most twisted endings this show has had Season 9 (1984) 7.9/10 A very enjoyable season but did get a little boring they made most of the season 1 night. And Emma roberts character was extremely boring and generic. I was really disappointed Evan peters wasn't in this season. Montana's character was one of the best this show has had. And a very entertaining character was the night stalker. The rest were honestly pretty boring , but overall I did really like this season helpful•32 7 ethanjjacobs Mar 22, 2021 FAQ5 Is the series available to own? I have not seen previous seasons.
