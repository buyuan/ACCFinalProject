Under license from Sony Pictures Music Group User reviews343 Review Top review 5/10 Meh I enjoyed the first film, was fresh. They didn't really offer anything new here, definitely more budget but that's about all. The first "room" dragged on and overall the rooms were not as inventive as the first film. When the solving of the puzzles involves nonstop changes in direction it loses any interest as it's just from one thing to another. More of a rental than at the movies. helpful•66 34 lucaschriskowalski Jul 10, 2021 FAQ2 Why did the release got delayed?
