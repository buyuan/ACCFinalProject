As a child, Jacinta became entangled in her mother's world of drugs and crime and has followed her in and out of the system since she was a teenager. This time, as Jacinta is released from prison, she hopes to maintain her sobriety and reconnect with her own daughter, Caylynn, 10, who lives with her paternal grandparents. Despite her desire to rebuild her life for her daughter, Jacinta continually struggles against the forces that first led to her addiction. With unparalleled access and a gripping vérité approach, director Jessica Earnshaw paints a deeply intimate portrait of mothers and daughters and the effects of trauma over generations. teenageprisonmotherdrughulu Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Hope Cannot be Confined Genre Documentary Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Add content advisory User reviews4 Review Top review 8/10 Wish her & her family all the best. I love watching documentary because it is real & tell the story better than reading in a book. After watching this film, I realize how powerful our parents' influence are. It is sad to see her life journey. After seeing her studying for her education.... so happy for her! Wish that would be the turning point of her life. helpful•4 1 ilovefoodcoma Oct 9, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 8, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Production companies ABC News Artemis Rising Foundation Impact Partners See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 45 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Related news IDA Documentary Awards Nominations: “Faya Dayi,” “Jacinta,” and More Nov 15Women and Hollywood 2021 IDA Awards Nominations Led by ‘Summer of Soul’ and ‘Faya Dayi’ Nov 15Thompson on Hollywood Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the English language plot outline for Jacinta (2020)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
