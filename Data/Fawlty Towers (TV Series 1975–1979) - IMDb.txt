He's intolerant, rude and paranoid. All hell frequently breaks loose as Basil tries to run the hotel, constantly under verbal attack (and sometime physical) from his unhelpful wife Sybil, and hindered by the incompetent, but easy target, Manuel, their Spanish waiter. —Rob Hartill manicfarceclass prejudicesnobbritish humour66 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genre Comedy Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Andrew Sachs (Manuel) was paid damages for his injuries by the BBC after a jacket was treated with acid by the special effects department to look as if it was on fire. It really did burn through to his skin and he bore the scars for a long time until they peeled off. Goofs Many times through every episode, the walls wobble, revealing them as set walls. Quotes Basil Fawlty: Where's Sybil? Manuel: ¿Que? Basil Fawlty: Where's Sybil? Manuel: Where's... the bill? Basil Fawlty: No, not a bill! I own the place! Crazy credits The Fawlty Towers hotel sign has its letters missing, or scrambled up to make new words. The sign presents a different error with each episode. Alternate versions For German TV-runs the main-theme was changed to "funnier" music. Connections Featured in The Pythons (1979) Soundtracks Fawlty Towers Written by Dennis Wilson Performed by Dennis Wilson Quartet [series theme tune] User reviews184 Review Top review All Downhill From Here Of all you'll ever see on the telly or the silver screen this has got to be the best. If you don't own this series you'll regret it - for if you rent it you'll be hard pressed to return it and everything you rent will be downhill afterwards. Donald Sinclair goes into history as the most brilliantly rude hotelier ever and John Cleese and then spouse Connie Booth go into history as the best sitcom writer duo ever. The teleplays were meticulously written and rewritten and the acting is better than superb. This series has been voted best television series of all time so many times now it's not funny. Odds are you will never laugh as hard as you do when you see this. And you won't tire of it quickly either. helpful•28 5 UACW Oct 20, 2006 Details Edit Release date September 19, 1975 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Languages English Spanish Also known as Das verrückte Hotel - Fawlty Towers Filming locations Wooburn Grange Country Club, Bourne End, Buckinghamshire, England, UK Production company British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 30 minutes Color Color Sound mix Mono Aspect ratio 4:3 Related news John Cleese Slams ‘Woke Rules’ After Cambridge Union Bans Speaker for Hitler Impersonation Nov 10Indiewire John Cleese Cancels Cambridge University Talk Over “Woke Rules” Nov 10Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Italian language plot outline for Fawlty Towers (1975)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
