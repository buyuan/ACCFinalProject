Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Originally, Leonardo DiCaprio was offered the role of Jon Peters in this film, but at the same time was also offered the lead role of Stan Carlisle in Guillermo del Toro's Nightmare Alley (2021), which led Bradley Cooper to sign on to this Paul Thomas Anderson film instead of DiCaprio. However after a few weeks in negotiations, DiCaprio's deal fell through and he had to drop out, creating the opening for Cooper to once again take over from DiCaprio.
