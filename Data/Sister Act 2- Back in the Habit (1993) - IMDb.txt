One of the girls, Rita Watson (Lauryn Hill), who is the most talented of the bunch, is forbidden to sing by her mother, Florence Watson (Sheryl Lee Ralph), although the choir has made it to the state championship. A group of monks tries to stop them. —Scott Hutchins <scottandrewh@home.com> nununruly childpart twolas vegas nevadareference to clarence thomas129 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines A comedy triumph ! Genres Comedy Family Music Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG for some mild language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Whoopi Goldberg's daughter, Alex Martin, appears in this movie as one of the classroom children. She says the "Yo Mama" line about Skittles. Goofs In the final performance of Joyful, Joyful, as the camera crane hovers over the act then changes to a shot of Whoopi Goldberg conducting and dancing with the group you can clearly see a camera move into the dancers behind Whoopi before it cuts to the next shot. Quotes Sister Mary Clarence: If you want to be somebody, if you want to go somewhere, you better wake up and pay attention. Crazy credits Sister Mary Lazarus says "Now wait a minute!" before the credits roll. Alternate versions In most TV broadcasts, the ending sequence of "Ain't No Mountain High Enough" is chopped off in order to keep the movie in its two hour time slot.

Amen. When the Nun's get sick of the unruly behaviour the kids display during school, and the lack of work that is being done, Mother Superior (Maggie Smith) calls upon Sister Mary Clarence, Deloris Van Cartier for help. So she's goin' back to the convent. She's gettin' back into that uniform, and, she's gettin' back in the habit! While there, Mary Clarence (Whoopi Goldberg) manages to transform the music class of non-listening, no attention-paying roudy little snots into a magical choir with voices of gold. It is here, that they decide to enter the regional championships for school singing (or something along those lines). However, one girl in particular, once a drop-out, with an awesome voice (played brilliantly by Fugee's frontwoman Lauryn Hill), is not intially allowed to go. Her mother (played by another R 'N' B singer Sheryl Lee Ralph, also from 'Moesha') will not allow her to. So she forges her signature and they head off to the championships. Jennifer Love Hewitt stars here, as one of the singing kids from the music class (bearing in mind, that she has since released 3 albums). Wendy Makkena and Kathy Najimy reprise their roles as two of the most-mentioned Nuns. Once again, Whoopi manages to pull off another great movie, without a great deal of trouble. Lot's of fun, but I enjoyed the first one, just a little bit more. 7./10 helpful•21 6 David, Film Freak Mar 3, 2001 Details Edit Release date December 10, 1993 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Cambio de hábito 2 Filming locations St. Peter & Paul Church - 666 Filbert Street, San Francisco, California, USA Production company Touchstone Pictures See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $38,000,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $57,319,029 Opening weekend US & Canada $7,569,219 Dec 12, 1993 Gross worldwide $57,319,029 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 47 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Phoebe Robinson Comedy Series ‘Everything’s Trash’ Ordered at Freeform Sep 30Variety Film + TV Phoebe Robinson Comedy ‘Everything’s Trash’ Lands Series Order At Freeform Sep 30Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit (1993) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
