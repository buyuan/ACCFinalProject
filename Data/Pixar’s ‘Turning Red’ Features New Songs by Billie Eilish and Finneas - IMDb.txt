Director Domee Shi says, “We needed our character Mei to be obsessed with something that her mom would not approve of. Boy bands were the first step into the world of boys for a lot of girls that age. The guys were all super pretty, polished, soft and loving, and they had of a way of bringing girls and their besties together. Plus, I thought it’d be really cool to create an animated boy band.” Eilish and Finneas contribute three new songs to 4*Town, the fictional band in the movie. “Nobody Like U” is featured in the new trailer.
