No one replaced the voice either. Goofs During the end card, if you look closely at the "The End" text, you can see the pages touching it before it wipes out.

I am 35 years old now. This is the best show for kids and older people. I think pbs did a good move adding this to the kids line up of shows. I love way Clifford and dog pals talk. The stories are the best as well. I know that people need a show for kids and not a lame one either. I loved the circus and Clifford with the elephant. Too much fun! helpful•4 0 caseyblindt May 13, 2019 FAQ2 Who sings/plays the theme song? What are the lyrics to the theme song?
