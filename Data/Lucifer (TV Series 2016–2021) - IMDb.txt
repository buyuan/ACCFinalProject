While there, he helps humanity with its miseries through his experience and telepathic abilities to bring people's deepest desires and thoughts out of them. While meeting with a Detective in his nightclub (Lux), a shootout involving him and the Detective leads him to become an LAPD consultant who tries to punish people for their crimes through law and justice. —ahmetkozan devilfemale police detectivefallen angelthe devillapd46 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines It's Good to be Bad. Genres Crime Drama Fantasy Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Tom Ellis (Lucifer) does his own singing throughout the show, although does not play the piano on screen. In early interviews for the show, he said he didn't "really know" how to. In 2019, a video of him accompanying himself on a piano whilst singing showed he's since added this skill to his repertoire (however, he has said in several interviews since that he is still only playing ¨air piano¨ in scenes as Lucifer). Goofs Sometimes when Chloe Decker answers her phone and holds it up to her ear, the phone is turned upside down. This seems to be a recurring thing within the show: Marcus turns his phone upside down to text and Lucifer turned his upside down to program access to his social media accounts for Amenadiel.
