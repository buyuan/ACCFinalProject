Forever Genres Comedy Horror Mystery Sci-Fi Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for language and some sexuality/nudity. Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The opening sequence displays the activities of an avian (bird) brood parasite, which are organisms that rely on others to raise their young. The brood parasite manipulates a host, either of the same or of another species, to raise its young as if it were its own, using brood mimicry, for example by having eggs (or pudgy, weird babies) that resemble the host's. This behavior relieves the parasitic parents from the investment of rearing young. Some bird species mitigate the risk of egg loss by distributing eggs among a number of different hosts. Goofs When Gemma and Tom are trying to leave that strange neighborhood with the car, Gemma is looking at their both cellphones. None of it have phone network. But they could have use the GPS instead, to find out where they are, and find a possible way out. Quotes Gemma: Did you see the boy? Tom: No. Gemma: He's gone missing. Tom: Well, so have we.

But then came the rest of the film. Tedious, repetitive, dull. I was SO glad when it was over.
