Connections Edited into Biography: Sherlock Holmes: The Great Detective (1995) User reviews20 Review Top review Jeremy Brett plays by far the best Sherlock until today. A good atmosphere fitting the Conan Doyle books takes you back to the days of the late 19th and early 20th century. Dialogs are often exactly or nearly the original text. Jeremy Brett plays a great Sherlock, with all the weird habits, qualities of character and humor which made this detective so popular that his return was requested after his death. Even the sense of superiority Sherlock shows is great. Watson is a good partner who is a background person, but present when necessary and so creating a good couple, and the right antipole. Just a good series for who loves the books, adding a person to a fiction character. helpful•25 4 PeeJay Oct 26, 1998 Details Edit Release date July 9, 1986 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Language English Also known as Die Wiederkehr von Sherlock Holmes Filming locations Granada Studios, Quay Street, Manchester, Greater Manchester, England, UK Production company Granada Television See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 1.33 : 1 Related news Sherlock Season 4 to premiere on New Year’s Day Oct 26Flickeringmyth Long Before Downey Jr. There Was Gillette: Lost Holmes Movie Has Been Unearthed Oct 3Alt Film Guide Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Spanish language plot outline for The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1986)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
