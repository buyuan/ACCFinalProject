Connections Referenced in Getting to know Emily, Jess, Claudia & Elysia (2018) User reviews17 Review Top review 7/10 A Typical But Fun Sports Movie That Raised the Bar A Bit This youthful gymnastic sports movie set in Australia ("Down Under") has the typical and predictable set up of an underperforming American gymnastic star outcome. With decent pacing, easy to follow storyline, this movie has a touched added bonus of actual extended edited gymnastic routines and moves that are exciting to watch that are usually omitted or excluded. There is also a nice addition of more rounded antagonistic characters. So overall, this fun, uplifting movie literally raises the bar of romance movies above average. helpful•1 0 tabuno Dec 22, 2020 Details Edit Release date May 2, 2016 (United States) Country of origin Australia Official sites Marvista Entertainment Official Facebook Language English Also known as Las chicas de oro Filming locations Adelaide, South Australia, Australia Production companies Full Twisting Double Back Glenpictures See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget A$850,000 (estimated) See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 33 minutes Color Color Related news Heath Freeman Dies; Bones Star Was 41 Nov 16TVfanatic Heath Freeman, ‘Bones’ and ‘NCIS’ Actor, Dies at 41 Nov 16The Hollywood Reporter - Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Spanish language plot outline for Raising the Bar (2016)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
