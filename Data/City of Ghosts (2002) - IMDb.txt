I recently spent a couple of weeks in Cambodia. The portrayal of Cambodia in the movie brought back many memories of the place, and I found the overall feeling to be accurate. We get a sense of the sadness and tragic history of the country, its current condition, and the wonderful warmth of its people (as portrayed by Sok, the cyclo driver, who is absolutely authentic). Some reviewers have complained that Cambodia is portrayed too negatively in this film. However, the bad elements shown - brothels, mugging and beating, corruption, Generals building casinos, and the run-down condition of Phnom Penh - are real. The film is about criminal characters who are doing some "business" in Cambodia, so it makes sense to see these seedy elements. To put it in perspective: we see many movies that show Los Angeles as a gang-ridden city with daily drive-by shootings, but that is only one slice of the city. (I do encourage everyone to visit Cambodia - it is a fantastic and beautiful place - but be aware, and pay attention to the warnings in your guidebook!) "City of Ghosts" does not sensationalize the seedy aspects of Cambodia. It merely shows them as part of the story being told. It does not get bogged down in the mud, but uses it as part of the backdrop of the story. The comparison to "The Third Man" is interesting and relevant. It points out how, in our modern world, not only is "Harry Lime" (Marvin) corrupt and soulless, but "Holly Martins" (Jimmy) is complicit in the crimes. We also see that the crimes of Harry Lime have become institutionalized and common today, not only in the third world (Generals spend tax and aid money building luxurious casinos, while Phnom Penh still looks like a war zone after twenty-five years of peace), but in the United States ("City of Ghosts" opens with massive insurance fraud perpetrated in the U.S. by Marvin). There is more depth to "City of Ghosts" than first meets the eye. Its understated style is deceptive. Rather than over-sensationalizing and over-dramatizing, it gives us something to think about. helpful•79 8 chmilar Jun 9, 2004 Details Edit Release date March 27, 2003 (Israel) Country of origin United States Official site United Artists Languages English French Central Khmer Russian Also known as Beneath the Banyan Trees Filming locations Bangkok, Thailand Production companies United Artists Mainline Pictures Banyan Tree See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $17,500,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $357,197 Opening weekend US & Canada $30,547 Apr 27, 2003 Gross worldwide $1,277,187 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 56 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Augustine Frizzell to Direct ‘The Invisible Life of Addie Larue’ Film Adaptation for eOne (Exclusive) Nov 16Variety Film + TV ‘The First Wave’ Review: A Courageous Cinematic Time Capsule That Captures How New York City Dealt With the Early Horrors of the Covid-19 Crisis Oct 8Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was City of Ghosts (2002) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
