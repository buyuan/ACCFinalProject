Genres Action Comedy Drama Fantasy Sci-Fi Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Agent Jimmy Woo produces his identification with a flick of the wrist, the card appearing in his hand as if by magic. This is a reference to the character's first appearance in Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) where he is shown to be instantly fascinated by Scott Lang's mastery of close-up magic, but completely unable to do any tricks himself. Goofs Numerous people identify the town as Westview, New Jersey, but all of the cars have Connecticut license plates. Quotes Agatha: Am I dead? Vision: No! Why would you think that? Agatha: Because YOU are. Crazy credits During the portion of the end credits that is accompanied by computer graphics, Elizabeth Olsen receives top billing in the odd-numbered episodes and Paul Bettany gets top billing in the even-numbered ones. However, they are followed by a more complete cast list in the non-animated part of the end credits in which Olsen always receives top billing. Connections Featured in AniMat's Crazy Cartoon Cast: D23 Expo 2019 Extravaganza (2019) User reviews2.5K Review Top review 10/10 Ignore every negative review before episode 4 It might have been an error on Disney's part to release only the first 2 episodes at once instead of 4 episodes. While I am on of the few people who absolutely loved the intrigue and mystery of the first three episodes, this exceptional show has been getting a lot of hate due to a lack of plot. ... And then the 4th episode came out. Not only was it an exceptional episode, but it justified the use of the first three and even gave some answers to the many questions of Wanda vision. Overall a brilliant show that shouldn't be judged on the first three episodes (especially if your only complaint is a lack of plot) helpful•1.5K 447 evansjoshyr Jan 29, 2021 FAQ9 Do you have to know about Marvel Studio's comic characters to 'get the jokes', understand the references, or will 'stuff' go over my head, and I won't get what was meant? Do you have to see this TV show before watching Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness to understand that film?
