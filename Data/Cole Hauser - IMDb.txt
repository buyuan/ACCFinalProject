Personal Quote: (On working on the set of Pitch Black (2000)) "Learning to use all of those weapons and looking like a professional mercenary. It's always fun to play someone like an action hero that you always wanted to play as a child. I think every young boy loves that as a kid. An additional positive experience I had was visiting Australia and exposing myself to that part of the world".

Warner, one of the founders of Warner Bros. Studios.
