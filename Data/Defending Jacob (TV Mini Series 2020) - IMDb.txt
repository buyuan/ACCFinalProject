He is respected in his community, tenacious in the courtroom, and happy at home with his wife, Laurie, and son, Jacob. But when a shocking crime shatters their New England town, Andy is blindsided by what happens next: His fourteen-year-old son is charged with the murder of a fellow student. Every parental instinct Andy has rallies to protect his boy. Jacob insists that he is innocent, and Andy believes him. Andy must. He's his father. But as damning facts and shocking revelations surface, as a marriage threatens to crumble and the trial intensifies, as the crisis reveals how little a father knows about his son, Andy will face a trial of his own - between loyalty and justice, between truth and allegation, between a past he's tried to bury and a future he cannot conceive. ‚Äîwaynerussell-76767 tv mini seriesinvestigationtwo killersmysterious villainmale protagonist32 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Family is Unconditional Genres Crime Drama Mystery Thriller Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Chris Evans and Jaeden Martell play father and son in this project.

Connections Featured in SportsCenter: Episode #42.124 (2020) User reviews541 Review Top review 9/10 Incredible effort - Beautifully acted - I am becoming a serious fan of Chris Evans. He's not just a pretty faced superhero. He really stood out in Gifted and I'm really excited to see more. Well done. This is a superbly designed series, I think it is a solid 9 - don't listen to the naysayers ... honestly, it's worth watching just to see the incredible segues in the opening credits. Watch it, binge it, worth it üòéüëåüèª helpful‚Ä¢178 42 hartmaa May 15, 2020 FAQ1 Just wondering if this is a update of the Neeson-Streep film "Before and After?"
