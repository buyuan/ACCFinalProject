She is surprised to find that she will be living in a convent: Nonnatus House. Working alongside fellow nurses and the medically-trained nuns, Jenny has her eyes opened to the harsh living conditions of the slums, but she also discovers the warm hearts and the bravery of the mothers. Even after Jenny leaves Nonnatus, she continues to chronicle the lives of the midwives who have become her family. —L. Hamre 1960snurseeast londonmemoirnun50 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines In 1950's London, they delivered hope for all. Genres Drama History Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The midwives are based in Nonnatus House, which is named after St. Raymond Nonnatus (nonnatus being the Latin for "not born") who was born by Caesarean section, and is the patron saint of pregnant women and childbirth. Goofs When Vanessa Redgrave (the voice of mature Jenny) appears on screen for the first time, the on-screen caption gives the date as 2005 and her husband Philip (Ronald Pickup) suggests she write her memoirs. However by 2005, the first two volumes (Call the Midwife and Shadows of the Workhouse) had already been published. Connections Featured in The Wright Stuff: Episode #17.10 (2012) User reviews101 Review Top review 10/10 TV at its best If you want history at its truth, watch a documentary. As entertainment this show has it all. Every episode has had me in tears from either laughter or poignancy. The casting is perfect and beautifully shot. It really shows the diverse community that has embedded itself in our culture today. Who cares if the docks were not in the right place! The show is about people coming together in tough times and bonding with a community regardless of class and colour. It makes me yearn for that kind of spirit in todays world where everyone has so much and yet is never satisfied. I really hope the BBC invest in a new series - I already miss Miranda! helpful•151 6 vivnista Feb 20, 2012 FAQ3 What products are referred to?
