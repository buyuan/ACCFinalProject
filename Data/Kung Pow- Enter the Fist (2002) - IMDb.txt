Writer/director Steve Oedekerk uses contemporary characters and splices them into a 1970s kung-fu film, weaving the new and old together. As the main character, The Chosen One, Oedekerk sets off to avenge the deaths of his parents at the hands of kung-fu legend Master Pain. Along the way, he encounters some strange characters, one of which is a cow trained in the martial arts. —kem kung fuchosen onemartial artsintentionally badhero145 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines From The Director Of ''Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls'' Genres Action Comedy Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for comic violence, crude and sexual humor Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Jennifer Tung (Whoa) dubbed herself. Steve Oedekerk dubbed all the other characters. Goofs When the Chosen One talks to his friends while they're wounded in the field, he has a tattoo saying "Mouth" with an arrow on his right cheek. The tattoo is given to him by an old man in a deleted torture scene, and can't be seen in any other scenes in the film. Quotes Master Betty: I have been called bad before. Many have said I do things that are not correct to do. I don't believe in talk such as this. I am nice man, with happy feelings. All of the time. First, a joke. What do you get when you cross an owl with a bungee cord? [pause] Master Betty: My ass. Nyah, haha, haha, haha, ENOUGH. Crazy credits Outtakes from the film (some real, some faked) play through the first couple minutes of the credits. Alternate versions Uses footage from Hu hao shuang xing (1976) with actors digitally inserted into original scenes, and new dialogue overdubbed. Connections Edited from Hu hao shuang xing (1976) Soundtracks From Rusholme with Love Contains elements of "Acka Raga" from the Album "Indo-Jazz Fusions" Written by Neil Claxton, Chris Baker and John Mayer Performed by Mint Royale Courtesy of Faith and Hope Records/MCA Records John Mayer appears courtesy of Universal Classics and Jazz User reviews534 Review Top review 'Enter' the theater and get ready to laugh! There's a good chance that when you saw the trailers and TV spots for this movie the first word that came to your mind was "stupid". Yes, this a stupid movie. It's one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen to be honest, but it is also one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Up until I saw this movie earlier today, I hadn't seen one good movie in 2002 so I can say that this is the best move of 2002..so far. No jokes fall flat [except the gay henchman was sort of annoying at times], the action scenes are well done, and it's always a treat to see really bad movies get spoofed. **** helpful•81 21 jellyneckr Jan 25, 2002 Details Edit Release date January 25, 2002 (United States) Countries of origin United States Hong Kong Mexico Taiwan Language English Also known as Kung Pow!
