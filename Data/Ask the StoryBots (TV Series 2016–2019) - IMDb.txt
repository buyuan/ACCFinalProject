Connections Followed by StoryBots Super Songs (2016) User reviews18 Review Top review 10/10 Storybots is Amazing I have a 4 year old daughter that can't get enough of this show, and we really hope they keep producing more episodes. I love the questions asked by the kids and how the Storybots go about solving their scientific inquiries. Heck, even I learned a thing or two when I watched the "Why is the sky blue?" episode. They don't make it cheesy or dumb it down. They break it down into parts that are easily understood by toddlers and have great humor that is safe for kids of that age, but still funny to adults. The songs are great for this age group and short for their attention spans. My daughter gets up and dances to a lot of them. Just an overall wonderful show! helpful•4 0 nicole_lewis Feb 10, 2017 Details Edit Release date August 12, 2016 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Netflix Site Language English Also known as Pregunta a los Storybots Production company JibJab Media See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 24 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news Daytime Emmy Nominations: ‘General Hospital’, ‘Sesame Street’, ‘The View’ Top List; CBS, Amazon Prime Lead Networks May 21Deadline Film + TV Berkowitz Brothers Developing Anxiety-Free Animated News Series ‘The Happy Broadcast’ Apr 7Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Ask the StoryBots (2016) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
