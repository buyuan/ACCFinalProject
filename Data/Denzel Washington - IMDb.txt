Personal Quote: [on the 2002 Academy Awards and his win] - I didn't want to go to the Oscars. After Hurricane, I was like, "I don't feel like dealing with these people. I'm just not going to go."

Colonel Nathaniel Serling in Courage Under Fire (1996) and Major Ben Marco in The Manchurian Candidate (2004). See more » Trademark: In almost all the films - e.g. Man on Fire (2004), American Gangster (2007), John Q (2002) - where he handles or uses sidearms (usually a 9mm Beretta or similar pistols), there's a scene of him swiftly ejecting a bullet from the loaded chamber by pulling back the slide assembly and subsequently catching the bullet before it falls to the ground.
