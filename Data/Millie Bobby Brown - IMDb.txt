Personal Quote: If you got to know her, I think she's just very caring and protective. And that's the only trait I could really relate to with my actual self. I'd probably say I'm very strong. If somebody says something horrible, I'm like, 'Okay, whatever.' With Eleven, people call her the weirdo and she really doesn't care. She's very badass and I think when I can be, I will be.
