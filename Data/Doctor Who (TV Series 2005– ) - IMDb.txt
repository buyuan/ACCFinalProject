(Series 3) Genres Adventure Drama Family Mystery Sci-Fi Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Julie Gardner has said that when David Tennant was approached to play the Tenth Doctor, he was immediately enthusiastic. His first response was to ask, "Can I have a long swishy coat?" Quotes [series 1 trailer] The Ninth Doctor: Do you wanna come with me? 'Cause if you do then I should warn you, you're gonna see all sorts of things. Ghosts from the past; Aliens from the future; the day the Earth died in a ball of flame; It won't be quiet, it won't be safe, and it won't be calm. But I'll tell you what it will be: the trip of a lifetime. Crazy credits During the first series, Christopher Eccleston is credited as "Doctor Who", as set in the Classic Series. Beginning with the second series - reportedly at the behest of the show's new star, David Tennant - the credit has been changed to read "The Doctor". Alternate versions In series 5, Amy has a prologue that only exists in syndicated versions and isn't present in the original UK airings. It doesn't appear on home media (DVD) either. Connections Edited into Ashens: Cybermen Call Centre (2006) Soundtracks Doctor Who Theme Written by Ron Grainer Performed by BBC National Orchestra of Wales User reviews900 Review Top review 4/10 bad writing is killing a series I love I just finished the 5th episode with Jodie Whitaker as the new doctor. The writing is so weak and the stories so dull and plodding that I can't blame the cast. I get that the transition to a new doctor takes some time both in terms of storytelling and character development. But there seems to be little continuity between the old and new doctor. They are technically the same person! I'm not asking her to be the same as the previous doctors. I get that they are trying to do some new things, take new paths and so some breaks with earlier seasons are necessary. But is feels like they have erased much of her past. Also, the old doctors used to have some fun. This doctor is kind of a grind. I get that the showrunner said they were going to stay closer to earth and old foes would not revisit the show much if at all, but the stories just feel juvenile and lack depth. I used to be excited to catch the next episode, but now it feels like drudgery just to get through it. Keep the cast, but something needs to be done about the writing! helpful•215 82 l-s-rosenblum Nov 5, 2018 FAQ13 If it was a reboot and disregarded the classic series and the 1996 TV movie what would it have been? Who is the Doctor? What is the TARDIS? And why does it look like a 1960s police box?
