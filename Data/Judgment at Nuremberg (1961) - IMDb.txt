This trial is about 4 judges who used their offices to conduct Nazi sterilization and cleansing policies. Retired American judge, Dan Haywood has a daunting task ahead of him. The Cold War is heating up and no one wants any more trials as Germany, and Allied governments, want to forget the past. But is that the right thing to do is the question that the tribunal must decide. —Tony Fontana <tony.fontana@spacebbs.com> war crimes trialnuremberg trialsallies occupation of germanywar crimes courtnuremberg germany41 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines More than a motion picture...It is an overwhelming experience in human emotion you will never forget! Genres Drama War Certificate Approved Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Spencer Tracy's eleven-minute closing speech was filmed in one take using multiple cameras shooting simultaneously. Goofs At the end of the movie a graphic states that 99 people were tried and sentenced at Nuremberg and that by the date of the movie (1961) none remained in prison. Some critics have pointed out that Nuremberg defendants Rudolf Hess and others were still imprisoned in Spandau. However, Hess and the other major defendants were tried by the International Military Tribunal (with judges and prosecutors from each of the four victorious Allied powers). The caption in the film states that the statistic refers only to the Nuremberg trials "held in the American sector." By 1961, all of the defendants sentenced in the American trials were indeed free; the graphic is therefore correct. Quotes [last lines] Ernst Janning: Judge Haywood... the reason I asked you to come: Those people, those millions of people... I never knew it would come to that. You *must* believe it, *You must* believe it! Judge Dan Haywood: Herr Janning, it "came to that" the *first time* you sentenced a man to death you *knew* to be innocent.

Unfortunately, what was done then, is being done by the leaders of our country in the name of protection from terrorists, and we, the people, sit silently by and let it happen just as the German people did seven decades ago. We need to watch films like this over and over to remind us of what is important and what we, as civilized humans, can be reduced to out of fear. This is another great film by the fantastic Abby Mann, who died last month. He won an Oscar for his screenplay, and it was well deserved. Maximilian Schell was simply fantastic, as was Spencer Tracy, Montgomery Clift, and Judy Garland. Director Stanley Kramer brought out the best in these actors, and others like Burt Lancaster, Richard Widmark, Marlene Dietrich, William Shatner, and Werner Klemperer. Don't look upon it as three hours of cinema, but as a class in humanity as only Abby Mann could write. helpful•6 0 lastliberal Apr 11, 2008 FAQ5 What is 'Judgement at Nuremberg' about?
