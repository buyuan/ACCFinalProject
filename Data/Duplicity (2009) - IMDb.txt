She burns him in Dubai. Jump ahead five years: he sees her in Grand Central and confronts her. Both now work in industrial security for corporate giants whose CEOs hate each other. Flashbacks fill us in: is it coincidence that he sees her in Grand Central? In about a week, one of the firms is going to announce a revolutionary product. Under the guise of helping that corporation's rival, can Ray and Claire work their own theft and find an independent buyer? To work together, using the corporate rivalry to their advantage, they would have to trust one another - difficult, if not impossible. Or, is one playing the other? —<jhailey@hotmail.com> spy versus spyframe upwritten by directorsplit screenscene before opening credits86 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Outwit. Outspy. Outsmart. Outplay. Then get out. Genres Comedy Crime Romance Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for language and some sexual content Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The character of Claire Stenwick is named for classic-era movie actress Barbara Stanwyck. Goofs During the opening-scene fight between the two CEOs in the airport it is supposedly raining (everybody carries umbrellas). However, Tully and Garsik do not get wet. Quotes Ray Koval: I think about you all the time. I think about you even when you're with me. I look at you, I can't stop looking at you. I look at you, and I think, "That woman... That woman knows who I am and loves me anyway." Crazy credits At the end of the movie, we see images of the supporting characters while each actor is credited. However, when Claire and Ray are shown, Julia Roberts and Clive Owen's names aren't shown.

User reviews199 Review Top review 8/10 Intelligent Film, stupid people beware. Wow, I can't believe how many people are writing that this was too complex and they got lost in the plot. This is only to be expected when movies such as Wolverine pull in +85M on opening weekend. People complain that there are too many dumbed down movies that spoon feed us and treat us like we are stupid, yet those are the movies everyone goes to see. Then we get an intelligent, well directed and well acted movie, that DOES wrap up the loose ends (despite some posters stating differently), and yet people complain it is too complex! I recommend this movie to anyone with the intellectual capacity to read a book. This is what Oceans 12 and 13 were trying so hard to be! helpful•62 47 theyearofthebengal May 4, 2009 FAQ6 Is "Duplicity" based on a book? Who and why are the two men fighting during the opening scene? Why does Garsik use a double?
