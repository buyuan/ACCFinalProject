A nobody. When two thieves break into his suburban home one night, Hutch declines to defend himself or his family, hoping to prevent serious violence. His teenage son, Blake (Gage Munroe, The Shack), is disappointed in him and his wife, Becca (Connie Nielsen, Wonder Woman), seems to pull only further away. The aftermath of the incident strikes a match to Hutch's long-simmering rage, triggering dormant instincts and propelling him on a brutal path that will surface dark secrets and lethal skills. In a barrage of fists, gunfire and squealing tires, Hutch must save his family from a dangerous adversary (famed Russian actor Aleksey Serebryakov, Amazon's McMafia)-and ensure that he will never be underestimated as a nobody again. —Universal Pictures fighting backrussian mafiahusbandblack comedyviolence303 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Never underestimate a nobody. Genres Action Crime Drama Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for strong violence and bloody images, language throughout and brief drug use Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Based on an idea by Bob Odenkirk, who dealt with a home invasion himself by trapping the trespassers in the basement. He was frustrated with how the authorities dealt with the situation and had thought about how he would take the matter into his own hands if he "was a badass." Goofs When Hutch gets his brother's text message telling him to go see the barber, his face can be seen in close-up with no scars whatsoever. Next shot, when he arrives at the barber's, his scars are back. Quotes Hutch Mansell: Give me the goddamn kitty cat bracelet, motherfucker! Crazy credits There is a bonus scene during the credits In which Hutch's dad David (Christopher Lloyd) and brother Harry (RZA) are driving in a camper van loaded with weapons.

No internet, no social media and no pc bullcrap. "Nobody" is a movie that feels like it came from another time. Just what the Expendables wanted to do but, in my opinion, failed miserably. There is no fan service, no bathing in the glory of former heroes who are way too old for that you-know-what. And no 1980 memorabilia for no reason. This movie just is what it is and the main character does what he has to do. Nothing more, nothing less. Logic? Leave it at the door! Complex plot? Read a book! This movie is just fast paced action and a welcome escape from reality. Just what we need these days. helpful•808 223 tandeki Apr 16, 2021 FAQ5 Does this movie take place in the John Wick Universe? What does the card tatoo on Hutch's wrist mean? The guy in the last tattoo parlor, who recognizes the card tattoo on Hutch's wrist looks a lot like Cillian Murphy. Especially the way his makeup was done like his role in A Quiet Place part 2. He has piercing eyes. Did he have an uncredited role?
