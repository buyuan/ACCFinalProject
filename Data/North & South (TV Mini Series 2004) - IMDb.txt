The BBC had low expectations, and didn't widely publicize the series. They were surprised when only hours after the airing of the first episode the message board on BBC crashed and had to be shut down due to the large number of visitors. Subsequently, the DVD was released on 11 April 2005, due to the huge success. Goofs In the last scene where Margaret and John are at the train station, the same woman in a brown bonnet and coat walks around or past the characters a total of eleven times. Quotes John Thornton: [When Margaret is leaving Milton in a carriage] Look back at me. Connections Featured in The Story of the Costume Drama: The Stars (2008) Soundtracks Factory By Martin Phipps User reviews118 Review Top review 10/10 a great adaptation With "North and South" the BBC has continued its fine tradition of producing great adaptations. Indeed "North and South" is one of the very best the BBC has done, capturing the nuances of the novel perfectly and bringing out the latent eroticism of the book. The only quibble is the way the screenwriter has changed the ending from that of the novel. Although this will irk some, I thought the new ending was in keeping with the story as a whole. The acting throughout is superb, especially from Richard Armitage as the brooding Mr Thornton - he captures exactly the character's pride, brutality, warmth and passion. I think Richard Armitage would be a very good James Bond. helpful•59 7 minerva-11 Mar 24, 2005 FAQ3 Is there a book available for this series? Where is Milton? I have no idea about 19th century England. What is this all about?
