While Igby's economics-studying Columbia-attending older brother Ollie Slocum has embraced and aspires to continue their wealthy life, Igby has rebelled against it, considering his brother a fascist (although he could soften that label to Republican). Because of Jason's situation, Mimi has largely left the role of male role model for Ollie and Igby to their godfather, D.H. Banes. Igby's rebellion has led to him being kicked out of one prep school after another, the latest, a military academy, from which Igby escapes before he can graduate. As such, Mimi and D.H. arrange for Igby to live in New York with Ollie for the summer while working for D.H. renovating some of his properties, before Mimi arranges for yet another strict school for the fall so that Igby can at least graduate. Igby is largely able to hide out for most of the summer with the help of Rachel, D.H.'s younger heroin addict mistress, and Sookie, a slightly older waitress with who he falls in love. An issue with Sookie and the aftermath of a joint mission with Ollie leads to Igby having a clearer picture of what his immediate future will look like. —Huggo mistresssex in bedpanties pulled downpink pantiesblack panties236 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Insanity is relative Genres Comedy Drama Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for language, sexuality and drug content Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The film is loosely based on J.D.

By Arrangement with Sony Music Licensing User reviews235 Review Top review 8/10 Quirky, Darkly Funny Coming Of Age Story With An Amazing Cast Igby caught me by surprise; I hadn't heard much of the film before seeing it and rented it on a hunch. What a beautiful, weird, sad, funny coming-of-age story and what a cast. The performances throughout are amazing. I absolutely adore this film. 8 stars out of 10 In case you're interested in more underrated masterpieces, here's some of my favorites: imdb.com/list/ls070242495 helpful•10 4 gogoschka-1 Feb 11, 2018 Details Edit Release date October 4, 2002 (United States) Countries of origin United States Germany Language English Also known as 玩酷子弟 Filming locations Central Park, Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA Production companies United Artists Atlantic Streamline Crossroads Films See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $9,000,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $4,777,465 Opening weekend US & Canada $306,705 Sep 15, 2002 Gross worldwide $6,919,198 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 38 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 Related news SNL: Kieran Culkin to Host in November Oct 24TVLine.com HBO Max New Releases: May 2021 May 1Den of Geek Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Igby Goes Down (2002) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
