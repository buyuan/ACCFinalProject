Brandon Teena is the popular new guy in a tiny Nebraska town. He hangs out with the guys, drinking, cussing, and bumper surfing, and he charms the young women, who've never met a more sensitive and considerate young man. Life is good for Brandon, now that he's one of the guys and dating hometown beauty Lana; however, he's forgotten to mention one important detail. It's not that he's wanted in another town for GTA and other assorted crimes, but that Brandon Teena was actually born a woman named Teena Brandon. When his best friends make this discovery, Brandon's life is ripped apart. —Zhe prejudicetransgendersexual assaultdrinkingsex152 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines A true story about finding the courage to be yourself. Genres Biography Crime Drama Romance Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for violence including an intense brutal rape scene, sexuality, language and drug use Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia When Hilary Swank was living as a man to prepare for the role of Brandon Teena, her neighbors believed that the young man coming and going from Swank's home (Swank in male character) was her visiting brother. Goofs The court summons Candace finds in the trash can (for which Brandon traveled to Lincoln) says "Hunt County." The courthouse building that Brandon walks into to pay the traffic ticket ALSO says "Hunt County." That would mean that Brandon walked into the very same courthouse where the bench warrant was earlier issued, but the sheriff tells Brandon that "this is what the Lincoln authorities faxed us over." Quotes Lana: Shut up. That's your business. Look, I don't care if you're half monkey or half ape, I'm gettin' you out of here. Crazy credits A special thanks to all of the transmen and butch dykes who helped, advised and auditioned for this project and supported the process of bringing this story to the screen. Alternate versions The USA version originally garnered an NC-17 from the MPAA. The film was cut and re-rated R. The European version reportedly is uncut.

The consequences of the circumstances in which we are born and then grow through, coupled with our natural predisposition, ultimately points us in a direction and path we choose to journey along. Sometimes, most often, these journeys are pretty ordinary, small peaks and troughs balance our contentment. If you're really lucky you'll find a way to squeeze a bit more happiness out than others but there are always risks that you end up with a bit more sorrow sucked in instead. On this occasion, Hilary Swank magnificently reveals the extreme consequences that can result when the choices you make about who you want to be, and who you are, deliver you into circumstances that have a considerably deeper impact than you could ever have anticipated. With a great supporting cast, a story of hate and prejudice that still echoes as loud as ever around the world today, sadly - and one that doesn't look like changing too soon either. helpful•14 6 Xstal Sep 23, 2020 Details Edit Release date March 31, 2000 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Fox Searchlight Language English Also known as Take It Like a Man Filming locations Austin, Texas, USA Production companies Fox Searchlight Pictures The Independent Film Channel Productions Killer Films See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $2,000,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $11,540,607 Opening weekend US & Canada $73,720 Oct 10, 1999 Gross worldwide $11,540,607 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 58 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Hulu New Releases: November 2021 Nov 1Den of Geek Can Will Smith avenge his Oscar loss to Denzel Washington or will he join this dubious list?
