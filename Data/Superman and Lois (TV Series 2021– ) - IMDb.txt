Genres Action Adventure Drama Romance Sci-Fi Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Some aspects are retconned from Supergirl (2015), both coming from creative liberties and as a result of the Crisis on Infinite Earths (2020) (V) events, including: Lois and Clark having two sons, Lois getting pregnant several years earlier than when she did Pre-Crisis, the Kryptonian pod appearance, Clark being able to orbit Earth (which Kara could not without a specific suit), Clark's proposal to Lois, and his heat vision now being traditionally red instead of blue. Crazy credits Superman flies by the WB logo and turns it into the DC Comics logo. Both logos are red and blue and are set on the Kent farm. Connections Featured in DC Fandome (2020) User reviews535 Review Top review 9/10 So Surprised I havent been a fan of the CW superhero shows for a long time and I watched this just to see what they had done. What a surprise! Well produced, good strong story to start, you feel the strength characters right from the begining. Just hope this doesnt end up going like the other CW shows with silly story lines, too main pointless characters and the need to add team mate after team mate. This felt like Superman lets keep that. helpful•193 44 alanm-25031 Feb 24, 2021 FAQ5 Is this actually confirmed by CW or WB? Where and when will filming began? How can Kal-El and Lois Lane as different species (which they are!) have a child, or are their boys adopted?
