I wish they do this with all the albums. As a big fan of Pink Floyd as soon as I saw the release I was excited; I just finished watching it and I love it. What you will find here is: Recent new interviews with Roger Waters, David Gilmour and Nick Mason and some material from Richard Wright before he past and some pictures and archive footage of the Great Syd Barret. They talk about each song , what it means to them and how it was created ; also Brian Humphries (sound engineer of Wish you were Here) take us through the recording process and Storm Thorgerson talks about the cover and some of the art work. The band talks about the emotional moment in which Syd appear on Abbey road and at first they didn't recognize him and there's some acoustic playing and singing by Roger and Dave in their interviews. For the fans it will a nice experience. I'm Happy :=). helpful•31 2 isaiasvalbuena Jul 1, 2012 Details Edit Release date June 25, 2012 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Official site Official Site Language English Also known as Пинк Флойд: История альбома Wish You Were Here Production company Eagle Rock Entertainment See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget £10,000 (estimated) See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 25 minutes Color Color Sound mix 6-Track Stereo Aspect ratio 1.78 : 1 Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Pink Floyd: The Story of Wish You Were Here (2012) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
