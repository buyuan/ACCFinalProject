Marvel character calls some friends for help. Marvel character finds out something they didn't know. Marvel character seems to have lost. Marvel character actually wins. Yep, standard Disney/Marvel recipe complete, put it out for people to watch, make a load of cash, rinse and repeat. I'm being really generous with my star rating because they had the guts to actually do a Black Widow movie. Still better than either of the Wonder Woman (I WONDER why I watched them) movies, but that's not saying much. It's like death and taxes now; there's bound to be an iffy Disney/Marvel movie or show along every six months or so. It's got to the point where it's like watching a soap opera because we're only still watching because we're invested in the characters. Soon enough the "normal" people will stop watching because they're not invested in the characters in the first place. helpful•39 18 gordon-mccrae Jul 15, 2021 FAQ6 Will Hawkeye be in this film? Who is the villain? How come we never got to know about the Red Guardian? Is he a super soldier like Captain America as well? If he is also a super soldier then why didn't we learn anything about him in The Falcon and The Winter Soldier?
