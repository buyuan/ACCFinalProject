TV Channel. Connections Featured in NBC Sunday Night Football: Week 1 NFL Kickoff Game: Houston Texans vs. Kansas City Chiefs (2020) User reviews22 Review Top review 1/10 Repulsive and staged What father is upset because his 30 year old daughter hasn't told her Dad she got breast implants? This is either a storyline idea that is outrageous or he's far too interested in his grown daughter's bodies. Some things you don't have to tell your Dad. They have no privacy from this large giggling idiot. He's way over animated to be believable. What grown children hang around their fathers house like this? Sorry, this show needs to go. He's barely watchable and he's downright obnoxious. helpful•10 3 sillydogsforever Oct 1, 2020 Details Edit Release date September 17, 2020 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Породица Бредшо Production company Shed Media US See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 30 minutes Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news Try Not to Laugh Watching Terry Bradshaw Visit a Renaissance Festival on The Bradshaw Bunch Nov 17E!
