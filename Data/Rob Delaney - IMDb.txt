Personal Quote: Making TV is not more important than driving a bus or making a table and chairs out of a stack of wood, but it's also not less important than that. People need their stories at the end of the day, after you've been driving the bus or making tables. You don't just want to enjoy yourself; you kind of need to. Trivia: Had filmed a cameo for Pokémon: Detective Pikachu (2019) and a cameo scene as Elvis Presley in Rocketman (2019). Both were omitted from the final cut.
