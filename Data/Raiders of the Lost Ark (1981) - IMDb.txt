An archeology professor named Indiana Jones is venturing in the jungles of South America searching for a golden statue. Unfortunately, he sets off a deadly trap but miraculously escapes. Then, Jones hears from a museum curator named Marcus Brody about a biblical artifact called The Ark of the Covenant, which can hold the key to human existence. Jones has to venture to vast places such as Nepal and Egypt to find this artifact. However, he will have to fight his enemy Rene Belloq and a band of Nazis in order to reach it. —John Wiggins ark of the covenantnaziindiana jonesarcheologistdamsel in distress271 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Indiana Jones - the new hero from the creators of JAWS and STAR WARS. Genres Action Adventure Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia When Brody first goes to Indy's house to discuss the mission, Jones is dressed the way he is because he is entertaining a young woman in his bedroom. The script originally planned to show her before moving to the next scene, to give Indy a more worldly persona (like James Bond). However, her appearance was cut, as Steven Spielberg thought that being a playboy did not fit Indy's character. Goofs In the flying scenes, the map lists several countries by their modern names instead of their 1936 names. Siam did not become Thailand until 1939. Transjordan did not become Jordan until 1949. Quotes Marion: You're not the man I knew ten years ago. Indiana: It's not the years, honey, it's the mileage. Crazy credits The mountain in the Paramount logo dissolves into the mountain in the Peruvian jungle. Alternate versions ABC edited 24 seconds from this film for its 1986 network television premiere. Connections Edited from Lost Horizon (1973) Soundtracks I am the Monarch of the Sea (1878) (uncredited) From "H.M.S. Pinafore" Music by Arthur Sullivan Lyrics by W.S. Gilbert Sung a cappella by John Rhys-Davies User reviews1K Review Top review 10/10 Great This movie has it all, action, romance, comedy, giant boulders and occult seeking Nazis. Story conceived by George Lucas and screenplay written by the same guy that wrote Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. If that doesn't sell it, then look no further than Steven Spielberg because he directed it. Awesome movie all around and definitely a genre classic. An absolute must see for any movie fan that likes fun. helpful•64 19 MR_Heraclius Feb 23, 2020 FAQ21 What are all these German soldiers doing in British controlled Egypt prior to World War II.? Appeasement aside, the British might be a little worried about a large group of armed Germans being in a League of Nations mandated British Protectorate. Did Belloq actually eat the fly that landed in his mouth towards the end? What is 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' about?
