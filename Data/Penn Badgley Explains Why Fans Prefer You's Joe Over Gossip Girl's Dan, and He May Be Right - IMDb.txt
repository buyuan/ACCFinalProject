Well, You and Gossip Girl star Penn Badgley is setting the record straight on why that may be the case, and it's sadly so cliché! In an interview with SiriusXM's Jess Cagle on Tuesday, Badgley explained that his Gossip Girl character became "increasingly irrelevant" to fans of the teen drama because they preferred to root for morally corrupt characters like Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick) and Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester) over "the nice guy." Meanwhile, on You, Joe is an obvious bad guy, and television fans are "much more accustomed to watching a show about a murder and being like, 'Woo, I love that guy'" these days. *Sigh* The bad-boy trope wins every time. Watch Badgley's full interview ahead of the Oct. 15 premiere of season three of You.
