After he misses his son's karate exposition, he tries hard to come up with a way to make it up to him. Jamie says he all he wants for Christmas is an action figure of television hero Turbo Man. Unfortunately for Howard, it is Christmas Eve, and every store is sold out of Turbo Man figures; now Howard must travel all over town and compete with everybody else including a mail man named Myron to find a Turbo Man action figure, and to make it to the Wintertainment Parade, which will feature Turbo Man. —John Wiggins christmasaction figurepostmanchristmas movie1990s216 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Two Dads, One Toy, No Prisoners. Genres Adventure Comedy Family Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG for action violence, mild language and some thematic elements Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Producer Chris Columbus wanted Joe Pesci to play Myron, but he was deemed too short at 5'3 next to Arnold Schwarzenegger who is 6'2. This was despite the fact that Schwarznegger had previously appeared in two films alongside the even-shorter Danny DeVito. Goofs There are references to radio/TV stations beginning with both "W" and "K" but the Mississippi River flows through the area, and there are stations on both sides. Quotes Howard: Put that cookie down. NOW! Crazy credits After the end credits, there is a brief heartwarming family scene, that ends with a question from Liz. She asks Howard what he got her for Christmas. Alternate versions The original UK cinema and video releases were cut by the UK censors to remove a 7 second sequence involving nunchucks. Following a review by the censors of the treatment of martial arts weaponary onscreen, this cut was restored when the film was classified for a UK DVD release in 2000.

User reviews224 Review Top review 6/10 Despite its problems, I thought it was funny 'Jingle All The Way' is a Christmas story about merchandising and family. A lot of people seemed to really hate this movie, but I did not think it was all that bad. Sure, some of the action and the story was not the best, but I thought it did provoke a lot of laughter. The scenes with Arnie at the warehouse filled with Santas and elves was funny, and it had a good ending with the father becoming the hero after all. It does represent the bad of the holiday season with all the merchandising and the over-emphasis on that one particular toy that kids must get for Christmas, and if they do not receive it, then they are outcasts. Despite its problems, I did find it a funny and worthwhile film. helpful•49 16 rebeljenn Dec 31, 2005 FAQ2 What are the differences between the Theatrical Version and the Extended Cut?
