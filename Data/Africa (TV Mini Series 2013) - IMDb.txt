Connections Featured in The Tonight Show with Jay Leno: Episode #21.69 (2013) User reviews11 Review Top review 9/10 Another BBC Wildlife Triumph Lucky enough to have seen the first three (To date) episodes in this wonderful new BBC wildlife series I can safely say that the BBC still rules the genre. This series explores not just the wildlife, which it does with brand new spectacular scenes, but also the relationship of the ecosystem with the geology and unpredictable weather systems and natural events. The production team have taken extraordinary measures to provide us with breath-taking scenes and amazing footage, using the latest technology and techniques. So far this season has kept my family, including our 4yr old granddaughter fixed, silently to the screen! The addition of the "Eye to Eye" excerpt at the end of each episode goes a little way to help us understand how these production teams make these shows, and for me, I always look forward to seeing what they are prepared to do to get "the shot of a lifetime." Wonderful stuff... helpful•27 1 Gryffonish Jan 26, 2013 Details Edit Release date January 2, 2013 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Official site Official Website - SonyLIV Language English Also known as Африка Production companies BBC Bristol Discovery Channel CCTV-9 See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 6 hours Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news Generation Africa Films Flip the Script on Stories We Tell About the Continent Sep 19MUBI ‘Seal Team’: When Will the First Paramount+ Episode Be Released?
