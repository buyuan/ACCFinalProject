Connections Featured in Radio Dolin: Hollywood surrenders to Asian movies, Sorokin's new novel and best role for Khodchenkova (2021) Soundtracks Bridal Chorus from Lohengrin Written by Richard Wagner User reviews113 Review Top review 8/10 Family entertainment I didn't see the first one. Forgive me. But I did enjoy the sequel. The effects with the rabbits are spot on, and the voices bring them to life has characters, so with the other animals. I was not quite has invested with the human characters, although Domhnall Gleason does have some funny moments, and Rose Byrne is alright in some scenes, but I became more interested in the scenes with the animals. But I believe this could be a film for kids and adults. helpful•12 6 DarkVulcan29 Jun 28, 2021 FAQ1 Why isn't Sony Pictures Animation producing Peter Rabbit 2?
