Bernard is also along for the ride, as Hacker's personal secretary. As in their previous roles, their jobs often devolve into a battle of agendas, ideals, wills and wits between Hacker and Sir Humphrey. —grantss sequelsatirebritish humour1980sbritish prime minister18 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genre Comedy Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia It is noticeable throughout the run of this show, (and particularly in the second series) that in most of Paul Eddington's scenes, he is sitting down. This was due to the fact that Eddington's health had begun to deteriorate and production changes had to be made to accommodate his condition. Quotes James Hacker: I know exactly who reads the papers. The Daily Mirror is read by people who think they run the country. The Guardian is read by people who think they ought to run the country. The Times is read by people who actually do run the country. The Daily Mail is read by the wives of the people who run the country. The Financial Times is read by people who own the country. The Morning Star is read by the people who think the country should be run by another country. And the Daily Telegraph is read by people who think it is. Sir Humphrey Appleby: Prime Minister, what about the people who read the Sun? Bernard Woolley: The Sun readers don't care who runs the country, as long as she's got big tits. Connections Featured in Comedy Connections: Yes Minister (2008) User reviews18 Review Top review Gorgeous This series is simply the best political comedy ever. From first hand experiences not with the british but the european administration and from my studies of political science I can pledge the satire to be really, really sharp. The dialogues are superb and I simply love the characters. Sir Humphrey is unbeatable. As a fellow writer already commented a must see for everyone into politics. helpful•23 3 BeEarnest Jan 20, 2004 Details Edit Release date January 9, 1986 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Language English Also known as Javisst, herr premiärminister Production company British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 30 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 1.33 : 1 Related news China’s Youku Inks Deal With BBC Studios for Scripted Series Feb 11Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Spanish language plot outline for Yes, Prime Minister (1986)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
