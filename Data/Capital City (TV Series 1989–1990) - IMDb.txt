User reviews11 Review Top review A great great series I have to agree with the other comment. This series had me spellbound from beginning to end and yet no one seems to ever have heard of it. It is a must see and I wish it would come out on DVD. I found the characters excellent and cast extremely well. You see some of them from time to time. The story was powerful and really well done. Hats off to those that wrote it and put it all together. The pressure portrayed in the series was fantastic. You agonized with the characters all the way through. I never saw the series in England but it must have been big there. It certainly was in the colonies. Again, bring it out on DVD. helpful•6 0 steve-1745 May 3, 2005 Details Edit Release date September 26, 1989 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Language English Production companies Euston Films Thames Television See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour Color Color Sound mix Mono Aspect ratio 1.33 : 1 Related news Calif.
