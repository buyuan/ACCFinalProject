Personal Quote: I really miss doing stage though, I really do. I actually prefer that, hands down to anything else and I can do it in bits and pieces but it's not that easy to commit to a play. Life's much easier if you can get work in TV or film so I don't know. I'll have a summer hiatus so maybe that's when I can do it. See more » Trivia: Her favourite actor is Tom Hanks.
