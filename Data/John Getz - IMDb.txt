Personal Quote: The world is experience, language, and stories. Collect them all, however you can. There are many ways to create and to be useful. If you want to be an actor, so be it, almost any road can take you there, and everything is grist for the mill. But get up on a stage. Study, learn, rehearse, enjoy it. Trivia: One of his earliest roles was as "Shampoo Man" in a Johnson & Johnson Baby Shampoo commercial shot in the late 70s.
