She's a straightforward high school girl who lives with her sister and her grandmother and has no qualms about letting it be known that she's uninterested in Shinto rituals or helping her father's electoral campaign. Instead she dreams of leaving the boring town and trying her luck in Tokyo. Taki is a high school boy in Tokyo who works part-time in an Italian restaurant and aspires to become an architect or an artist. Every night he has a strange dream where he becomes...a high school girl in a small mountain town. —Happy_Evil_Dude japanese high school girljapanese schoolgirlin love with a co workerjapanlove302 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Experience Japan's #1 film of 2016, from visionary director Makoto Shinkai Genres Animation Drama Fantasy Romance Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The red braided cord that Mitsuha wears represents the invisible red string of fate that is said to connect someone to their fated person, according to Japanese tradition. Goofs After Taki and Mitsuha meet on the edge of crater and Taki is left alone after end of dawn, a panoramic view shows the city's lake in its original form (before comet hits the city). It shouldn't be the case, as Taki is back to present day, where collision has occurred. Quotes Hitoha Miyamizu: Treasure the experience. Dreams fade away after you wake up. Crazy credits At the end of the film, as both the lead characters simultaneously says "Your name...", the title of the film appears. Alternate versions Although the film was not released in India in an official Hindi dubbed version, a YouTuber AnimeTM Dubbers has provided one, with the credits showing the name of Hindi voice cast instead of the original.

Not only it is emotional and feels real, it delivers a relevant message. I love the imagination and palette but also appreciate that it aims to remind us of social issues that we should be paying attention to. The only reason I don't give our heroes and their story a 10/10 is that I still feel a couple of Miyazaki movies (like Kiki, Chihiro and the racoon dogs) were just that much better and showed a little more imagination. Whatever the case I live in fear of the Hollywood announced remake by Hollywood hack JJ Abrams who has never shown any talent or vision. As with others I will ignore and boycott that coming insult and always cherish kimi no na wa. helpful•491 42 bup-53144 Nov 5, 2017 Details Edit Release date December 2, 2016 (China) Country of origin Japan Official sites CoMix Wave Films (Japan) Funimation Films (United States) Language Japanese Also known as Ni de mingzi.
