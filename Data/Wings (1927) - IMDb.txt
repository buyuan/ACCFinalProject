Jack Preston is a keen auto mechanic, building and modifying cars. David Armstrong comes from a wealthy family. They are both in love with the same woman, Sylvia. Her heart belongs to David but she doesn't let Jack know and plays along with his infatuation. Meanwhile, Jack's neighbour, Mary, is deeply in love with him but he just views her as a friend. WW1 interrupts the romantic entanglements as Jack and David enlist in the US Army Air Service (Air Service of the AEF at the time). They are initially bitter enemies, due to them both vying for Sylvia's affections. Over time, however, they become very good friends. They are both posted to the same fighter squadron in France, where being a fighter pilot means every day could easily be your last. —grantss world war onefriendshipmilitary trainingbisexualbisexual subtext67 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines An Epic of the Air Genres Drama Romance War Action Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for war violence Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Was lost for decades until a copy was discovered languishing in the Cinematheque Francaise film archive in Paris, France. Goofs The film is set during the years 1917-1918. However, most of the female civilian clothes and hairstyles are contemporary with the late 1920s, particularly the clothes worn by Clara Bow in the home sequences and in the Folies Bergère sequence. Bow and almost all the other female characters have bobbed hair, common in 1927 but almost non-existent during World War One. Quotes Sergeant in Mervale: Hey, if youse guys need kissin' *I'll* kiss you - wit' a gun-butt! Alternate versions Some showings have trimmed Clara Bow's brief topless scene. Connections Edited into The Eagle and the Hawk (1933) Soundtracks The Star Spangled Banner (credited on 2012 restored score only) Written by John Stafford Smith & Francis Scott Key User reviews104 Review Top review VHS version with Theater Organ music track For a feeling of what the silents were really like, look for the version of this film with Gaylord Carter performing the score on a Wurlitzer Theater Organ. Carter recorded this version in the 1980's when he was in his 80's. Amazing performance - basically 120 minutes of live, somewhat improvised music with establihed themes for each character. Incidental music was improvised live combining themes from the various characters. Carter was one of the last musicians that performed during the silent era. Very few musicians understand how difficult this art form was, and Gaylor was one of the best. Each showing of the film was an original, never before heard version due to the improvisational nature of the music. The stamina required to play live music, on 3, 4 or even 5 keyboards with a pedal board and dozens of stops, thousands of pipes for over two hours cannot be overstated. Especially when one of these performers were expected to do so 3 or more times a day! Orchestras are all well and good, but few theaters could afford them - Wurlitzer (and a few other companies) sold 40,000 instruments to theaters world wide during the 20's, and chances are, 90% of screenings of this film were accompanied by a theater organ. helpful•14 3 occjph Sep 12, 2004 FAQ1 What is a Bangalore Torpedo?
