Personal Quote: I would never see this movie because I'm frightened of horror movies. Ever since I was a kid, my friends who always wanted to see them would mortify me by showing me clips from a movie, and I would have to run in the other room, call my parents, and go home -- that kind of thing. (on her film The Hills Have Eyes (2006)) Trivia: Grew up in Topanga Canyon in California.
