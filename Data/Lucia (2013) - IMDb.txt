An usher at a decrepit cinema suffers from insomnia. His life changes when he starts getting weird and wonderful dreams but with a caveat. Set in the teeming young metropolis that is Bangalore, the film is a turbulent ride where the lines between dreams and reality are blurred to delirious effect. —Rakesh drugs Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Tinbeda Kammi ... Genres Drama Sci-Fi Thriller Certificate Not Rated Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The entire film has been shot in digital format on Canon 5D and GoPro. Goofs Suvarna News is the news portal used through out the movie but the jingle that plays when the TV anchors break for an ad is tv9's. Crazy credits The sequence of beginning title credits occur at reverse sequential order.

Oh my god what a movie! and Why don't these movies come into the mainstream cinema? and if i'm correct this is the first film to be "crowd funded" in India. The script is an exceptional one and the way it is executed takes the cake! This is such a technically brilliant movie in more than one dimension; not only Editing, choreography, BGM etc.. but also the story telling is just mind blowing and the treatment of the script is fresh as a blooming flower! Although there is a clear difference between the two parallel story lines as one part is in black & white, but still the way the script is executed you should have the thinking cap on your head firmly! Last but the not least this movie would invariably become a cult classic and miss this film at your own risk because invariably there will be so many clones spewed out in the near future but it would require a touch of genius as well as madness to repeat this kind of brilliance! helpful•14 4 faizermohomed5 Oct 27, 2013 Details Edit Release date September 6, 2013 (India) Country of origin India Official sites Official site Official site Language Kannada Also known as Люсия Production companies Audience films Creathma Productions SpicyChakra Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget ₹5,100,000 (estimated) See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 2 hours 15 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 Related news Birmingham Indian Film Festival ready with a spectacular line up of cutting edge films!
