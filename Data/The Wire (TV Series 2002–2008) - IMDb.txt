Seen not only through the eyes of a few policemen and drug gang members but also the people who influence and inhabit their world - politicians, the media, drug addicts and everyday citizens. —grantss urban decaybaltimore marylandcorruptionwiretappingdrug war21 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines A new case begins... (second season) Genres Crime Drama Thriller Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia While filming, Andre Royo was once approached by a Baltimore resident, who handed him a package of heroin and said he looked like he needed a fix. Royo calls this his "street Oscar." Goofs Throughout the last two seasons, Carcetti repeatedly refers to a possible gubernatorial challenge in 2008, after serving two years as Baltimore mayor. But Maryland holds gubernatorial elections in off years - 2006, 2010, etc. The new governor would have been elected the same year that Carcetti was elected mayor - 2006 - and up for re-election in four years, not two. Quotes Freamon: A life, Jimmy, you know what that is? It's the shit that happens while you're waiting for moments that never come. Crazy credits In every episode, after the opening credits a quote appears on the screen that will be spoken by a character in that episode.

A couple of weeks ago I heard an interview with a young actor from this series on NPR. It was described as a "gritty crime drama" with many Baltimore locals portraying variations on themselves. The interview made it sound interesting enough that I decided to check out the first season on DVD. After the first few episodes I became seriously hooked and devoted 36 hours of the next ten days to the show. Having now watched the first 3 seasons, I believe it to be the best television series I have seen. I do not understand why this show hasn't generated the buzz or the awards of HBO's other series, such as the Sopranos or Deadwood. It is more gripping, faster paced, and more intelligent. The other shows can be a bit plodding, with plot lines that go nowhere, and a few characters I don't much care about. That wasn't the case here. The show is a cross between the Sopranos and the old NBC show Homicide: Life on the Street. The crime/sopranos side and the law/Homicide side run in parallel. Individually, the parallel plot lines are compelling. In tandem, they are complimentary and brilliant. There is no way to avoid having "the best show ever" tag sound like anything but silly hype--regardless, what makes this show substantially better than any other realistic and compelling crime or police drama is the fact it is... searching. It doesn't just delve into the individual psychologies motivating these people (ala the Sopranos) or the complex interactions amongst the members of a community (ala Deadwood) it asks "what the hell can be done for all of these people" and points out the problems with any and all of the answers. It's truly brilliant. If you like intelligent television, I envy the enjoyment you will have watching this for the first time. helpful•766 132 jaoneal Sep 20, 2006 FAQ20 Why did Bunk cut off his colleague's necktie? What does FIve-O (5-0) mean ? The organization leaders, especially Proposition Joe, are always talking about "the connect" & "re-ups". What are they?
