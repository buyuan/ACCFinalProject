I know this will divide people with it's very slow pacing and symbolism too outlandish and sometimes weird, but this is a great film about taking advantage of the earth and all it has to offer from the animals, water, food etc. it's pretty much a cautionary tale split into chapters. I really love the cinematography and editing choices because it reminds me a lot of Raw meets Dogtooth. A lot of uncomfortable wide shots and when it needs it, closes-ups are a plus. helpful•7 0 deathgrip1234 Mar 18, 2021 Details Edit Release date November 19, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United Kingdom Official site Official site Language Welsh Also known as Gwledd Production companies British Film Institute (BFI) Ffilm Cymru Wales Great Point Media See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 33 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 2.39 : 1 Related news Movie Review – The Feast (2021) Nov 15Flickeringmyth Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the French language plot outline for The Feast (2021)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
