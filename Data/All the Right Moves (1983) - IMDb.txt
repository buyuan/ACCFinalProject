They went to separate schools, and while Cruise was spotted after just one day because someone recognized him from Taps (1981), Thompson went four days, was asked out by many guys and got caught smoking. Goofs Cruise is thrown off the team, but somehow his father and brother know about it in their hometown bar moments after the game is over; yet the team hasn't come home yet. Quotes Steff: Scholarship here, no scholarship here. Who the hell gave you that power? Connections Featured in Siskel & Ebert & the Movies: Tom Cruise: The Star Next Door (1990) Soundtracks All The Right Moves (Main Title) Performed by Jennifer Warnes and Chris Thompson Music by Tom Snow Lyrics by Barry Alfonso Produced by Tom Snow and Brooks Arthur User reviews65 Review Top review an under-rated piece of entertainment A few years ago, I bought the video version of All The Right Moves without having seen it before. I loved it! The characters kept my eyes glued to the screen for the whole 90 minutes. I emphasized with Stef's internal struggle to rise above his surroundings. Stef, played by one of my fave actors Tom Cruise, is similar to his character Joel from Risky Business. Both Stef and Joel have high hopes for their futures and almost jeopardize them. As with his character Hayden Fox on the TV series Coach, Craig T. Nelson plays a football coach who is rough around the edges but has the capacity to redeem himself later. Lea Thompson's Lisa has more value to the movie than just another girlfriend figure. She too has hopes for the future and feels cheated by the athlete-favored scholarship programs. When Stef verbally pushes her away, she doesn't immediately forgive him; she pulls him into her world first. Nobody (so far) has mentioned the sound track; it's my favorite part of the movie. The songs do a superb job of setting the tone for the given scene. For example, when Stef is rounding second base with Lisa in the car, the bus ride to the big football game, the party, and the end credits. Sometimes, I watch ATRM just to hear "Blue Skies Forever," sung by Frankie Miller. All the Right Moves is a good film to watch if you like high school football; are expecting an athletic scholarship; or if you don't like your coach. This movie paved the way for other football flicks like Varsity Blues. Look for it on The Family Channel or at used-movie stores. helpful•8 3 dek1158 Jul 21, 2001 Details Edit Release date October 21, 1983 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as All Right Filming locations Johnstown, Pennsylvania, USA Production companies Lucille Ball Productions Twentieth Century Fox See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $5,600,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $17,233,166 Opening weekend US & Canada $1,625,486 Oct 23, 1983 Gross worldwide $17,233,166 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 31 minutes Color Color Sound mix Mono Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Hulu New Releases: November 2021 Nov 1Den of Geek What’s Coming & Going From Hulu in November 2021 Oct 22TV Insider Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was All the Right Moves (1983) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
