To live rich Dushane and Sully go into partnership with top don Bobby Raikes ('Geoff Bell (I)'). Rivalry with Kamale (Scorcher) and his gang results in their loan from Raikes being stolen, and they swear revenge.

I highly recommend Top Boy for any fan of gritty, intense dramas! I didn't watch it until recently because of everything I heard about it and I'm so glad I finally gave it a chance and that Netflix made the incredible choice of bringing it back because it's as good as ever! helpful•13 1 Supermanfan-13 Mar 28, 2020 Details Edit Release date October 31, 2011 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Language English Also known as Top Boy: Summerhouse Production company Cowboy Films See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 Related news ‘King Richard’: How Director Reinaldo Marcus Green Impressed Will Smith and Scored a Dream Gig Nov 9Indiewire ‘Belfast,’ ‘The Duke’ Set U.K. Release Dates – Global Bulletin Nov 5Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
