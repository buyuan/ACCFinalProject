Connections Featured in The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon: Susan Sarandon/Elijah Wood/Little Big Town (2017) User reviews98 Review Top review 9/10 The Working Women Of La La Land Ryan Murphy managed the virtually impossible. Finding a tone and the tone has to do with the humanity of this Hollywood gargoyles. I wonder if young Joan and Bette knew where they were heading. Those women that their daughters wrote about, were they who they were or who they became. Jessica Lange throws a light on Joan Crawford that made me, already, re-think her myth. Her fear is actually tangible. Great, great performance. Susan Sarandon captures Davis's temperament and allow us a glimpse into the contradictory nature of the woman. Brilliant, succinct observation - when she throws herself into the role of wife and mother, she was thoroughly miscast. Alfred Molina is superb as Robert Aldrich and Stanley Tucci is terrific as Jack "I show you my hemorrhoids" Warner. I can't wait for the next episode. helpful•143 14 willandthomas-picturehou Mar 13, 2017 FAQ1 Why is this not on DVD? What is the hold up?
