Genres Action Biography Drama Sport Certificate Not Rated Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia After gaining 28 kg. for the initial shoot, Aamir Khan lost 25 kg. in 20 weeks to portray the younger (25 years old) character of Mahavir Singh Phogat. Goofs Teenage Babita is left-handed, which you can see from the way she claps during Geeta's Dangal matches. But she becomes right-handed when she gets older, which you can see from the way she claps during Geeta's Commonwealth games. Quotes Mahavir Singh Phogat: You have to fight in a way that people will remember you. If you win silver, sooner or later, you will be forgotten. If you win gold, you will be an example, And examples are given, child... not forgotten. See those girls? If you win tomorrow, you will not win alone. Millions of girls like them will win along with you. It will be a victory for every girl who is considered inferior to boys; who is forced into household chores, who is married off to just raise children. Tomorrow's match is the most important one. Because tomorrow, we are not fighting just that Australian, but all those people who think lesser of girls.

But he fails to achieve that, then He avow that his son will do it. However, he got disappointed when his wife gives birth to four daughters. Music: 9/10 Amazing, Very touching background. Greatly Synced Title track will give you goosebumps Direction: 9/10 Nitesh Tiwari achieved what he wanted, Got a new name, One of the best directors of Bollywood. Acting: Aamir Khan: 10/10 This time as a father, He will amaze you in every scene. His acting skills are deeply great. Whenever I watch Aamir's movies, I feel his acting. He loves acting and entertaining the world since He came to the Film Industry. Fatima Sana Shaikh: 9/10 Sometimes I still watch Chachi 420, because I love Kamal Hassan. And Fatima Sana Shaikh was the little girl in Chachi 420. Seriously I have seen her after Chachi 420. And after Dangal she will go so far. Aamir Khan and the two lead actress are the best cast roles in a long time, but overall cast done an amazing job. Dangal is humorous and Inspirational Journey. helpful•69 37 faisalfaves Dec 23, 2016 Details Edit Release date May 5, 2017 (China) Countries of origin India United States United Kingdom Australia Kenya Namibia Official site Official site (Japan) Languages Hindi English Also known as Shuai jiao ba!
