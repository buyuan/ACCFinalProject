Angel Eyes, The Bad (Lee Van Cleef), is a hitman who always commits to a task and sees it through--as long as he's paid to do so. And Tuco, The Ugly (Eli Wallach), is a wanted outlaw trying to take care of his own hide. Tuco and Blondie share a partnership making money off of Tuco's bounty, but when Blondie unties the partnership, Tuco tries to hunt down Blondie. When Blondie and Tuco come across a horse carriage loaded with dead bodies, they soon learn from the only survivor, Bill Carson (Antonio Casale), that he and a few other men have buried a stash of gold in a cemetery. Unfortunately, Carson dies and Tuco only finds out the name of the cemetery, while Blondie finds out the name on the grave. Now the two must keep each other alive in order to find the gold. Angel Eyes (who had been looking for Bill Carson) discovers that Tuco and Blondie met with Carson and knows they know where the gold is; now he needs them to lead him to it. Now The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly must all battle it out to get their hands on $200,000.00 worth of gold. —Jeremy Thomson shootoutspaghetti westernman with no namecivil warthird in trilogy219 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines They formed an alliance of hate to steal a fortune in dead man's gold Genres Adventure Western Certificate R Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia According to Eli Wallach, when it came time to blow up the bridge, Sergio Leone asked the Spanish Army Captain in charge to trigger the fuse, as a sign of gratitude for the Army's collaboration. They agreed to blow up the bridge when Leone gave the signal "Vai!" (Go!) over the walkie-talkie. Unfortunately, another crew member spoke on the same channel, saying the words "vai, vai!", meaning "it's okay, proceed" to a second crew member. The Captain heard this signal, thought it was for him, and blew up the bridge. Unfortunately, no cameras were running at the time. Leone was so upset that he fired the crewman, who promptly fled from the set in his car. The Captain was so sorry for what happened that he proposed to Leone that the Army would rebuild the bridge to blow it up again, with one condition: that the fired crewman be re-hired. Leone agreed, the crewman was forgiven, the bridge was rebuilt, and the scene was successfully shot. Goofs You can see a car passing by in the background when Tuco is balancing on the cross on the graveyard in the end of the movie. Quotes Blondie: You see, in this world there's two kinds of people, my friend: Those with loaded guns and those who dig. You dig. Crazy credits Although Eli Wallach has the most screen time and is one of the titular characters, he is credited as "...and Eli Wallach in the role of Tuco" after all the other actors' names appear. Alternate versions Syndicated on US TV in 2006 as a 95-minute truncated version, missing almost half of its original length. Connections Edited into Bellissimo: Immagini del cinema italiano (1985) Soundtracks The Story Of A Soldier by Tommie Connor User reviews1.2K Review Top review 10/10 A Cinematic Masterpiece - And Also The Most Entertaining Western Of All Time I'll keep this brief: This is simply one of the most entertaining and best looking westerns ever. Director Sergio Leone's unique use of the camera - long, uninterrupted shots in wide angle alternating with extreme close-ups - and Ennio Morricone's unique, wildly inventive soundtrack are blended to perfection. The career-making performances by Eli Wallach (hilarious), Lee Van Cleef (chilling) and Clint Eastwood (cool) are nothing short of iconic, and the film's finale is so good it will send shivers of cinematic joy down your spine. It's a movie of epic proportions; it's funny and violent, but underneath it all there is a strong anti-war message. It's a cinematic masterpiece and one of the most influential movies of all time. Oh, and it's also tons of fun, and you should see it on the biggest screen possible. 10 stars out of 10.

What was the large battle depicted later in the movie when the bridge was blown? Was it based on an actual battle? During the detonation of the bridge, you can see an object flying towards Blondie and Tuco in their bunker. It hits a sandbag about 0.8 meters to the right of Blondie and you can see the actor jump when it hits. Were the actors in danger? The object seems to be heavy like a rock and about the size of a softball. Another meter to the left and Blondie would have been hit dead center.
