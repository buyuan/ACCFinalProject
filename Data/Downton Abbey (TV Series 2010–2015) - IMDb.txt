The death of his heir aboard R.M.S. Titanic means distant cousin Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens), a Manchester lawyer, suddenly is next in line and accepts moving onto the vast estate with his even more modernist, socially engaged mother, who clashes with his Lordship's domineering, conservative mother, the dowager countess. Marrying off the daughters is another concern. Meanwhile, the butler presides over a staff which serves the family, but also lead most of their entire lives in the servants' quarters, intriguing amongst themselves. —KGF Vissers vito russo test passed1910syorkshire englandbutleremployer employee relationship51 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines War changes everything Genres Drama Romance Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia During the second season, the Abbey is turned into a recovery house for troops. At Highclere Castle, the house used for the show, the Countess of Carnarvon turned the house into a hospital in World War I. Unlike Cora Crawley (Elizabeth McGovern), the Countess eagerly opened her home and there are letters in some of the rooms from former patients thanking her for her hospitality. Goofs In episodes showing a Christmas tree inside Downton Abbey, classy all-white Christmas lights with tiny raisin-sized bulbs are lit; however, these impressive lights didn't appear for sale until the late 1960s and early 1970s. In the series' historical period, the smallest bulbs available were Mazda Lights, which are golf ball-sized.

OK so I'll admit, Downton isn't a academic study of social change, nor is it entirely original ( let's be honest) - but it doesn't pretend to be! Does that make it any less of a excellent drama? No! Does That decrease the clever, witty and delicious writing? No! Does it cloud the ( at many moments) wonderful acting? No! Admittedly it isn't hard core drama - but it was lovely, it made me feel warm, it let me get all cross and annoyed (in a nice way), it got me exited - and soothed. Honestly what more can you ask for?? Maggie Smith is excellent as the snooty Dowageress, Brendan Cole does Mr Bates very well - and Joanne Froggat (who I only manage to catch on tele occasionally sadly) who was equally lovely. It was all just lovely! helpful•138 45 fudge_factory Jan 6, 2011 FAQ14 What is the difference between the US and UK broadcasts of Downton Abbey? How did the episodes skip from 1912 to 1924? Why is Cora an American?
