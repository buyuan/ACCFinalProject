Personal Quote: (on paying $2.7 million for Mark McGwire's 70th home run ball) "Right now I'm the guy who paid $2.7 million for a piece of History. If the record is ever broken I'll be the guy who paid $2.7 million for a $2.70 baseball ball." Trivia: "Cyan" is the name of creator Todd McFarlane's daughter, while "Wanda" is the name of his wife.
