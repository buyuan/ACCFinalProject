Genres Comedy Drama Romance Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Even when she was being shot from the waist up, Kim Cattrall insisted on wearing heels. She said it made her feel more like Samantha. Goofs In the earlier series, the exterior the Carrie's apartment was another apartment block (in one episode we see a couple having sex through this windows). In later series, the exterior changes to the street outside and the other apartment seems to have moved. Quotes Samantha: You men have no idea what we're dealing with down there. Teeth placement, and jaw stress, and suction, and gag reflex, and all the while bobbing up and down, moaning and trying to breathe through our noses. Easy? Honey, they don't call it a job for nothing. Alternate versions The producers cut a scene featuring a terrorist alert from the fifth season after deciding it was inappropriate. The show's main character Carrie Bradshaw - played by Sarah Jessica Parker - was to be seen being blocked when she tried to get onto a roped off New York subway which had been closed by the authorities. Connections Featured in The 56th Annual Golden Globe Awards 1999 (1999) User reviews297 Review Top review 8/10 One of a kind Endlessly rewatchable, sex and the city is a one of a kind tv show epitomizing the early 2000s. With a long running tv show it's inevitable to have some good and not so good storylines. But for the most part, SATC got it right, showcasing four single girls navigating love and life in New York City. One of my all time favs. helpful•15 1 Calicodreamin Apr 30, 2020 FAQ4 Did sex and the city promote biphobia What is the full name of Miranda's kid? Why is he called Mr. Big?
