Quotes [first lines] Maria Bartiromo: But you took a huge bet on the housing crisis in the middle of the biggest boom in housing anybody has ever seen. Why? Robert Miller: I'm a child of the '50s. My father welded steel for the Navy, and my mother worked at the V.A. They lived through the Depression, Pearl Harbor, and the bomb. They didn't think that bad things might happen. They knew that bad things would happen. Maria Bartiromo: Is that what's happening now? Robert Miller: When I was a kid, my favorite teacher was Mr. James.

Connections Featured in Maltin on Movies: Arbitrage (2012) Soundtracks So Soft Written and performed by Gary Anderson (ASCAP) Published by Teretone Productions LLC Courtesy of Teretone Music Productions User reviews180 Review Top review 7/10 Gere simply perfect Richard Gere in his probably best performance ever, confident, tense, deep. The veteran actor used all his qualities in this very gripping "Arbitrage", a drama about crazy and cynical calculations behind Wall Street intrigues. Arbitrage asks the viewer to sympathize with a guy cheating and trying to cover terrible things and shows many different characters, such as hard-working cops, an immaculate daughter, ruthless business partners, as well as a suffering wife. There are holes in the plot but the audience doesn't mind too much, because of the perfect tension and the detailed script. Gere is perfect, he gets to show real desperation, anger and discomfort at the same time. Arbitrage is special and different from other similar movies due to its refusal to condemn this world. helpful•6 0 antoniotierno Mar 24, 2013 FAQ1 What exactly did Miller do for Grant's father that made Grant risk so much to protect him?
