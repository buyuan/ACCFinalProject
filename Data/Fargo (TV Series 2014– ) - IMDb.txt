Helping him piece things together is his father-in-law, Sheriff Hank Larsson. The investigation will lead them to a colorful cast of characters that includes Karl Weathers, the town lawyer of Luverne, Minnesota. A Korean War vet, Karl is a flowery drunk blessed with the gift of gab and the eloquence of a true con artist. Joe Bulo, the front man for the northern expansion of a Kansas City crime syndicate. The new face of corporate crime, Joe's bringing a Walmart mentality to small town America. His number two is Mike Milligan. Part enforcer, part detective, Mike is always smiling - but the joke is usually on you. Bulo and his crew have their sights set on the Gerhardt crime family in Fargo, currently led by matriarch Floyd Gerhardt. With her husband at death's door, Floyd takes over the family business, frustrating her eldest son, Dodd Gerhardt. An impatient hothead with a cruel streak to match his ambitions, Dodd can't wait for both his parents to die so he can take over and expand their business from kingdom to empire. Bear Gerhardt is the middle son, an intimidatingly large man who, although inarticulate, is the most decent of his clan. Rye Gerhardt, the youngest of the Gerhardt clan, views himself as a big shot, but in reality he's just a small dog who barks big. —FX Networks police officeranthologyinsurance salesmanvito russo test failedblack comedy80 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Aw jeez, here we go again. (Season 1) Genres Crime Drama Thriller Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Billy Bob Thornton came up with his character's hair cut on his own. The moment Noah Hawley saw him, he knew they were both on the same page regarding the character. Goofs In episode 8 when Lester recognizes Lorne in the club in the story he is telling he says: "...And it hurt but I didn't want to look stupid so I try it again..." but when the full conversation is shown in episode 9 he replaces the word "stupid" with "dumb". Quotes Lester Nygaard: Aw, heck! Connections Featured in Late Night with Seth Meyers: Kristen Wiig/Colin Hanks/Mario Batali (2014) User reviews697 Review Top review 8/10 Great series, except for season 4 which sucks... Season 1, 2 and 3 are all 8/10 seasons, but season for brings the whole series down and is only a 5/10 season at best... season 4 has multiple plot holes in multiple episodes and is honestly a disappointment. The only solice is that season 4 isn't connect to the other seasons at all in the story, and so you can just skip season 4 entirely and only watch the other seasons of the series and you'd be much better off that way. helpful•76 20 0w0 Nov 12, 2020 FAQ11 Season 3 Episode 1 when the camera switch from East Berlin to Minnesota at 6:01 there is a short music played, does anybody know the name of that song?Thanks.
