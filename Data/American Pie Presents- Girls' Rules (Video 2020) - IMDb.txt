This makes it the first American Pie movie out of all theatrical releases and spin-offs to have no male nudity. Goofs After running into the door, Michelle's teeth are red, presumably this is blood though her lips are intact and no blood drips or runs from her mouth. After a minute or so her teeth are white. Crazy credits There is a post credit scene with principal Fisher as a dominatrix and janitor Steve.

A silly film, of idiots in love Cade the real Stifler, this woman is nothing at all. helpful•182 28 recebasfreita Oct 7, 2020 FAQ1 Is there going to be another American Pie direct to DVD film?
