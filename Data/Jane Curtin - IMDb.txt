Personal Quote: [on winning the Emmy Award] You think your life's going to change; it's going to change dramatically! I'm going to be a different person, and, you know, people are going to be flocking to my door with scripts. Nothing happens. You just walk around in the evening with this really heavy weapon in your hand, and nothing changes. And yet the build-up is so huge... and nothing. Trivia: Met her husband, Patrick Lynch, at a hockey game.
