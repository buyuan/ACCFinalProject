Star Blazers Skyfall See more » Reviews Obcan Brych (1959) When times are changing 13 December 2020 Very interesting and intimate depiction of living through turbulent times. In this case during the communist coup in the Czechoslovakia. Some people are victoriously celebrating. Some are planning to emigrate. There are hippocrites turning their coats and following the new order. However, the story is centered around ordinary people not inclining to either side. They just want to live their lives. But is it possible when the society is so divided? You're either with us, or against us - they say... If you have lived through any change of regime or perhaps a coup, you will find the situations and dilemmas very familiar. If not, you can ask yourself - what would I do if I were there?

The great themes of love and honor are being dealt kind of ironically. Here, the focus is on the idea: you can be free only when you follow the rules of the society. There's nothing much wrong with that. Bad luck this movie was made in 1970's – time of strict "normalization" (renewal of communist control over Czechoslovakia). Orlie pierko is not bad or dull as propaganda films from the 50's. It just wants to show that police force is good when you are good citizen. But, when you know it was the police state, it just leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Under these circumstances, mountains and nature are not important in this movie, even thou they intended to be. They are just padding the story. See more▼See less▲ Tango s komármi (2009) Finding its place 2 January 2010 - 1 out of 1 users found this review helpful. Plot of this movie is quite strange. Man coming back to his motherland to divorce his wife he hasn't seen many years. Another guy keeping an eye on him – to make sure he really does it. There are also other interesting characters. It takes some time before they start to be connected into meaningful (yet a little bizarre) story. Anyway it turns out to be a nice movie, with decent acting, showing image of our world. Especially Central Europe – a decade or so after fall of communism. Returning or just visiting emigrants from the west, meeting those left behind. On the other side, there are already also immigrants from the east. All of them are trying to find their happiness. Do not take me wrong, this is not political movie. It's about finding a home. Building a home. Struggling with relationships. Finding a better world. This is a movie worth watching.
