Connections Featured in AniMat's Crazy Cartoon Cast: D23 Expo 2019 Extravaganza (2019) User reviews404 Review Top review 8/10 Great scenarios, but varies between episode Now that the first season is over, I can confidently say that this series has exceeded my expectations. It uses witty scripts and detailed animation to bring the fans the service they've been wanting and more. Each episode is quite varied so there are many different scenarios and you never know how it will turn out or which characters will show up. The series wastes no time explaining any of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and just gets to the point of the scenarios, and also starts to merge the scenarios without warning. This is for the fans, not casual viewers! However, the variety of episodes also means that the quality and tone also vary quite drastically. The short runtime means that many events and battles are cut short. There was a good amount of care to make everything canon and consistent, but there are still some shortcomings and the power/ability of each character seemed to be contrived based on the needs of the plot. helpful•16 7 briancham1994 Oct 10, 2021 Details Edit Release date August 11, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Disney+ dnalyrics Language English Also known as 假如······？ Production companies Marvel Studios Flying Bark Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Dolby Atmos Aspect ratio 2.20 : 1 Related news "What If...?" - One Question Changes Everything Nov 15SneakPeek Upcoming Michael B.
