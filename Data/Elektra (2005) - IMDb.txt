A strong, mysterious and a deadly sexy action heroine - a lethal synthesis of grace and power. Not long after recovering from seemingly mortal wounds, Elektra has severed all ties with the world, living only for her next assignment. But in an unexpected turn of events, she is forced to make a decision that can take her life in a new direction - or destroy her. Key players in Elektra's journey are Stick, a blind martial arts master responsible for Elektra's "resurrection," and Mark Miller and Abby Miller, a father and daughter on the run from The Hand, a powerful syndicate whose members practice the dark version of the martial art Kimagure. —Anthony Pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com} assassinheroinemartial artssamurai swordvigilante justice209 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines She's the last thing that stands between good and evil. Genres Action Adventure Crime Fantasy Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for action violence Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Jennifer Garner reportedly told a journalist that she felt this movie was terrible, and that she only filmed it because of contractual obligations from "Daredevil (2003)." Goofs (at around 12 mins) During one flashback, Elektra goes back to her ride in the ambulance when she dies. The paramedics use a defibrillator on her. A defibrillator is only supposed to be used on bare skin but they have it being used over a leather vest. (This was most likely done to help connect the flashback to her final scene in Daredevil by showing the costume she wore that night.) Quotes Stick: Some lessons can't be taught, Elektra. They must be lived to be understood. Crazy credits The Marvel Comics logo features comic-book images of Elektra in its pages. Alternate versions There is a directors cut that is three minutes longer with some extra scenes.

The effects are outstanding, the camera-work wonderful, and the acting quite good. Garner (almost always) moves like a trained fighter, and Prout looks at least well practiced. The plot was fairly fluid and interesting if not engrossing. Over all it was better than I expected. See it and enjoy it. Since concise opinions aren't allowed here, I may as well add that the costumes were quite well done. Also, the sound was peachy. Did I mention that Jennifer looked swell?
