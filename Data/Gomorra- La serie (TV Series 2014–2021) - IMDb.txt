Genres Crime Drama Thriller Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Roberto Saviano, who penned the book 'Gomorrah', on which the television series and feature film were based, has been under 24 hour armed police protection for the last decade. Saviano claimed that when the book was first released that gang members passed it around as gifts, but as it grew in popularity his life became under imminent threat. Connections Followed by L'immortale (2019) User reviews233 Review Top review 10/10 It's Ruined TV A good friend of mine said to me, 'it was the best thing he'd ever seen, and it would change my life'. I'd never even heard of it, so that was a big statement. Turns out, he wasn't lying. Me and the wife watched all 4 seasons and then the movie in less than 4 weeks and now that it is finished, I am gutted. It's left a big hole in our TV life. It has completely ruined TV for me because nothing else comes close to how good it is. We put 'Gangs of London' on straight after it, hoping it would fill a hole. We barely got to the end of Episode One, it was pathetic. Good if you're a 12-year-old boy who thinks one man can kill 15 hardened Albanian criminals in a pub like a cockney Chuck Norris! Gamorrah has none of that rubbish and is really realistic. No fighting or over the top car chases- just a bullet in the chest. The acting is beyond brilliant, the grim backdrop is dramatic, and the characters are encapsulating. I've been told by an Italian mate of mine that the area it is set in falls into the top ten of most dangerous places in the world. The programme does it justice. It is brilliantly and cleverly written; teasing you to like a character and then snatching them away from you. No one can be trusted, not even family. I've been pining for it so much since it ended that I've even been watching youtube interviews in Italian! The subtitles can sometimes be difficult to follow because the dialogue moves so fast, but it is never overly important. It is way beyond anything I have ever seen. Pure brilliance. Anyone who would give this less than 10/10 would probably enjoy Gangs of London or Ninja Turtles. helpful•30 2 ljboden May 26, 2020 FAQ1 What are the filming locations?
