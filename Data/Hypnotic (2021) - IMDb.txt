Soundtracks Nocturnes, Op. 9: No. 1 in B-Flat Minor Composed by Frédéric Chopin Courtesy of BMG Production Music Inc User reviews154 Review Top review 4/10 Terrible writing. Kate Siegel is a good actress however the writing in this film is done poorly. This is a revenge thriller since there really isn't any mystery to uncover. The film uncovers exactly what's happening within the first quarter of the film. Pervvy psychologist using hypnosis. With no mystery to solve, the film becomes very boring. Feels like your typical boring Lifetime movie. helpful•57 16 Horror_Flick_Fanatic Oct 28, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 27, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Netflix Site Language English Also known as Thôi miên Filming locations Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada Production company The Long Game See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 28 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 2.39:1 Related news Noah Centineo’s Netflix Spy Drama Adds Series Regulars and Guest Cast Nov 12Variety Film + TV Noah Centineo’s Netflix CIA Drama Series Sets Seven Series Regulars Nov 12Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What was the official certification given to Hypnotic (2021) in Brazil?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
