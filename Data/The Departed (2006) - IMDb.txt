Young undercover cop Billy Costigan is assigned to infiltrate the mob syndicate run by gangland chief Frank Costello. While Billy quickly gains Costello's confidence, Colin Sullivan, a hardened young criminal who has infiltrated the state police as an informer for the syndicate is rising to a position of power in the Special Investigation Unit. Each man becomes deeply consumed by their double lives, gathering information about the plans and counter-plans of the operations they have penetrated. But when it becomes clear to both the mob and the police that there is a mole in their midst, Billy and Colin are suddenly in danger of being caught and exposed to the enemy - and each must race to uncover the identity of the other man in time to save themselves. But is either willing to turn on their friends and comrades they've made during their long stints undercover? —Anonymous policemobsterirish mafiaorganized crimescene of the crime549 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Lies.

Genres Action Crime Drama Certificate (Banned) Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Leonardo DiCaprio described his character as being in a "constant, 24-hour panic attack." Goofs (at around 2h 5 mins) When Sullivan pulls up Costigan's record in the computer, his date of birth is initially listed as 11/7/1984. The next time he pulls up the record, the date is 11/7/1980. Quotes Lazio: [during a conference briefing about Costello and his crew] without asking too many questions do you have anyone in with Costello presently? Dignam: Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe fuck yourself. Crazy credits The title doesn't appear on screen until nearly 20 minutes into the movie. Alternate versions In India, the film was given an A (adults only) certificate after the visual of Frank Costello holding a dildo was deleted. This change is visible in the Hindi dubbed VCD which shows a slight frame jump.

User reviews2.4K Review Top review 8/10 This one is about the mark of a great director Like i said, this film is about the mark of a great director, in this case a well paced, well written, violent movie with a great choice of songs, a mark that Scorsese is known for doing so well, but this one here is not his best film (not saying it's bad, far from it) but definitely not the one he should have won the oscar for, in my opinion the film that the Academy should give his best director award, was way back for Raging Bull, also not forgetting that he wasn't even nominated for Taxi Driver, but anyway, judging this film, it have a great cast, full of good performances, especially by Leonardo Dicaprio and Mark Wahlberg. Also, this movie is a remake of a 2002 Hong Kong film called Mou gaan dou, the second time that Scorsese did a remake, the first one being Cape Fear (1991). helpful•14 2 pedroborges-90881 May 10, 2021 FAQ20 The name of the porn movie that is being shown at the theater Colin (Matt Damon) and Frank (Jack Nicholson) meets?
