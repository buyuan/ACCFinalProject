The series chronicles their descent from a complicated but thriving team to savage clans, while also tracking the lives they've attempted to piece back together nearly 25 years later, proving that the past is never really past and what began out in the wilderness is far from over. —SHOWTIME school Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Drama Horror Mystery Thriller Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia At school assembly in the gymnasium (17:41) the Principal quotes the song from the movie Footloose (1984) "Let's hear it for the boys. Let's give the boys a hand." by Deniece Williams User reviews17 Review Top review 10/10 Can't wait to see how this unfolds I wasn't sure if the plot of this initially. The beginning events in the first minute are " weird ", but after finishing the first episode, i can't wait to see how this whole story will unfold. I really need to know what happened in the woods now. I just hope it doesn't get too over the top. I have to say the casting is one of the main reason i gave 10 stars. The older current day version of the teenagers is spot on. Especially Shaunas character. I mean 2021 version legit looks just like teen one would like 25 years later. The teenaged girls acting is superb and i love the 90's vibe as well. But great show so far and i can't wait till next Sunday ! helpful•5 9 serenamariav Nov 14, 2021 Details Edit Release date November 14, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site SHOWTIME Language English Also known as Шершні Filming locations Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada Production companies Creative Engine Entertainment Entertainment One See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news Showtime TV Show Ratings (updated 11/16/2021) Nov 16TVSeriesFinale.com Yellowjackets: Season Two?
