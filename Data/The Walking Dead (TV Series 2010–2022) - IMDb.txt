Fear the living. Genres Drama Horror Thriller Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia All of the principal actors have a "Last Supper" the day they film their death scenes. This "unorthodox idea" came to Frank Darabont's mind when he was watching Season 1 of Sem Saída (2009), a comedy show starring actor/singer Gustavo Goulart. Goofs A lot of the time characters kill walkers by pushing a knife up through their bottom jaw. Most of the knifes they use are not long enough to reach the brain and so walkers are essentially just being stabbed in the mouth, yet this seems to be an effective method. Quotes Negan: [to Rick] Sucks, don't it? The moment you realize you don't know shit. Crazy credits With each passing year (or season) the title of the show (seen when the theme song is playing) decays a little more. Executive producer Gale Anne Hurd confirmed this.
