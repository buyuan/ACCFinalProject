As their owner Andy prepares to depart for college, his loyal toys find themselves in daycare where untamed tots with their sticky little fingers do not play nice. So, it's all for one and one for all as they join Barbie's counterpart Ken, a thespian hedgehog named Mr. Pricklepants and a pink, strawberry-scented teddy bear called Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear to plan their great escape. —Walt Disney Studios toyevil teddy bearrecyclingsheriffjanitor312 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines The Breakout Comedy Of The Summer Genres Animation Adventure Comedy Family Fantasy Certificate G Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia A stuffed bear resembling Lotso can be seen in Toy Story (1995) during the staff meeting. Woody asks if the toys "up on the shelf can hear" him, and we see a shot of a big, pinkish bear. John Lasseter wanted to use Lotso in the original Toy Story, but Pixar had trouble getting the fur right. Goofs During the incinerator scene Slinky Dog is first pulled to the ceiling, realizing its because of a magnet the other toys grab metal objects to get pulled up and escape the grinder. On the other side of the grinder the toys release the metal objects and fall back to the conveyor belt, inexplicably Slinky is there with them and the magnet seems to no longer affect him. Quotes [last lines] Woody: So long... partner. Crazy credits During the beginning of the ending credits, it is shown what becomes of Sunnyside and Andy's toys. Jessie turns on a Spanish version of "You've a Friend in Me" and dances a paso doble with Buzz. Alternate versions South African version was released with Jeremy Mansfield (A well known Radio Personality) as the voice of Chatter Phone.

I went in with HIGH expectations. I LOVED the first two Toy Stories movies. Toy Story is a beloved franchise that almost everyone that I know loves the first two films. Now how about the 3rd film? Well all I could say is that it lived up to my unbelievably HIGH expectations and then some. This is such a good film. It has the laughs, magic and best of all the entertainment. The new characters in the movie feel like they were in the previous two films, they were that engaging and really worked well in the movie. The best part of the movie has to be the ending, I almost cried and was moved to just about to tears. I truly believe that this is one of the best Trilogies of all time. It might even rival the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. This movie has a real chance to become the First Animated Film to win Best Picture. I surely would not be surprised. 10/10 An Amazing End to a Fantastic Series Go Watch It helpful•1K 110 The_Fifth_Echo May 27, 2010 FAQ17 What is 'Toy Story 3' about?
