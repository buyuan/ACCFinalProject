That's kinda lame". Great acting still, amazing sets, overrides the glaring flaws of the series, an enjoyable watch overall. 7/10. helpful•73 27 daniel-65836 Sep 30, 2021 Details Edit Release date September 17, 2021 (South Korea) Country of origin South Korea Official site Official Netflix Languages Korean English Urdu Also known as 鱿鱼游戏 Filming locations Seoul, South Korea Production company Siren Pictures See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 8 hours 5 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Atmos Aspect ratio 2.00 : 1 4K UHD Related news Critics Choice Awards Voters’ Guide: 2022 TV Races Heat Up, Thanks in Great Part to ‘Squid Game’ Nov 17Variety Film + TV ‘Squid Game’s Jung Ho Yeon Jung Signs With CAA Nov 17Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
