He awoke and found himself trapped in the past, facing mirror images that were not his own and driven by an unknown force to change history for the better. His only guide on this journey is Al, an observer from his own time, who appears in the form of a hologram that only Sam can see and hear. And so Dr Beckett finds himself leaping from life to life, striving to put right what once went wrong, and hoping each time that his next leap will be the leap home. alternate timelinealternate realityalternate historyaltering historybody swap30 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Action Adventure Drama Mystery Sci-Fi Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Al's cigar was the idea of Dean Stockwell, who said it was "a good way to get free cigars for five years." Goofs For the famous "mirror reflections" in which Sam sees who he leaps into, the series used the old trick of a dual set with a clear glass in the "mirror". Scott Bakula would stand on one side and the actor playing the person he leaped into on the other. If you look really close at the glass, you can see sometimes Scott Bakula's reflection. (Especially if the mirror is near a source of light like sunshine). Quotes [Repeated line] Sam: Oh, boy... Alternate versions Airings on the Comet digital channel have a recap of the previous episode at the top of some Season 2 shows, and restores Sam's end-of-episode leaps into a rerun, as originally aired, instead of the next scheduled first-run episode.

A highly imaginative idea from Donald P. Bellisario. The selection of Scott Bakula and Dean Stockwell to play the roles of Sam (the quantum leaper) and Al (Sam's advice-giving & holographic guide) was spot on. The story lines were great. The series consisted mainly of fictional plots, interspersed with the odd story based on real life events. In addition, the show's original signature tune was great! The acting, especially from Scott and Dean, was first class. In fact, you don't need to be a sci-fi buff to enjoy Quantum Leap ........ a Bellisario masterpiece! ________ 9 out of 10! ________ Carl Giwa. helpful•82 10 b_e3Kpi Aug 28, 2004 FAQ1 What's up with the show's obscure ending?
