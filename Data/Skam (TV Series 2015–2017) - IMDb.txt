Connections Remade as Skam France (2018) User reviews64 Review Top review 10/10 Incredibly Good and Progressive Show. SKAM was an experience, from beginning to end, that I firmly believe people of all ages can enjoy, though I will admit it will probably appeal most to the teenage mind. This show combines well-written characters with interesting plot lines and development to create an amazing show viewers will fall in love with. It does have its issues with a few somewhat dull scenes, including one scene that consists solely of characters eating breakfast in silence, but that can be forgiven. SKAM is the first show I've seen in a very long time that has cast teenagers to play teenagers. Not only that, but the actors are a part of the production and do get a hand in deciding things about their character. The show itself contains some great messages about standing by your friends, accepting yourself, and coming to terms with your identity, and they do it in a tasteful and realistic way. No one gets their happy ending without making a few mistakes along the way. The show does contain some themes that are often considered taboo for teenagers to do or even talk about in today's society, like drinking, sex, partying, and drugs. SKAM does a great job of portraying the teenage party scene in a realistic but still kind of tasteful way. Overall, SKAM is a great show that I would encourage most people to watch. Maybe not a show to watch with your little sibling or kid, but a good show for people over the age of thirteen. helpful•35 8 cairnholm Jan 5, 2017 Details Edit Release date September 25, 2015 (Norway) Country of origin Norway Official sites Official Facebook (Norway) Official site (Norway) Language Norwegian Also known as Shame Filming locations Oslo, Norway Production company Norsk Rikskringkasting (NRK) See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 30 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 16:9 HD 2.00 : 1 Related news Nrk’s Head of Drama Ivar Kohn Talks Stepping up International Partnerships (Exclusive) Oct 10Variety Film + TV ‘Tú no eres especial’ Producer Puy Oria on Shooting the First Netflix Original Series Filmed in Navarre Sep 15Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What was the official certification given to Skam (2015) in Italy?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
