Horrible's life is thrown for a loop when he falls in love with Penny, a beautiful and optimistic advocate for the homeless he meets at the laundromat, a situation which complicates itself even further when Penny begins dating the boorish, oafish Hammer after he apparently saves her life. Faced with the task of impressing the League, can Horrible overcome his own incompetence to ruin the day, kill the hero, and still get the girl? —Ted Z. laundromatremote control vehicleaccidental deathhomeless shelterfreeze ray15 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines He has a Ph.D. in horribleness!

Connections Featured in The Making of Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog (2008) Soundtracks My Freeze Ray (uncredited) Performed by Neil Patrick Harris User reviews83 Review Top review 10/10 Just plain awesome I honestly didn't know what I was getting myself into when I first sat down at my computer to watch this. I had heard that Joss Whedon had created it, and I was a fan of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer series, but I didn't know what it was about or anything. Forty Five minutes later, I was completely blown away. The songs, writing, and acting are just amazing. It made me laugh, and nearly cry. It's so creative, and has superheroes in it, which I love. If you're someone who isn't sure about it, just watch Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog anyway. I promise you will not be disappointed. Dr. Horrible has a P.h.D. in horribleness, and awesomeness. helpful•49 7 booth-is-my-angel Dec 11, 2008 FAQ6 What songs are featured? What about the DVD? Will there be a sequel?
