Cahalan was fortunate to be correctly diagnosed because, according to Najjar's estimates, only 10 percent of people with the disease were properly diagnosed at that time. Since then, a better understanding of the disease and its symptoms has resulted in more frequent diagnosis and treatment. Quotes [first lines] Susannah Cahalan: Have you ever been trapped? Lost in your own body, lost in your own mind, lost in time? So desperate to escape, to just... Get out. Soundtracks Song for Kirsten Dunst User reviews151 Review Top review 10/10 Incredible movie creating awareness! When I looked up this movie at first I was skeptical, due to the reviews on this website..... Boy were they wrong ! This is a hell of a movie, the acting is superb. During this movie I got so angry at the doctors, because this is how that world really works. Not only is it based on actual events, it highlights all that is wrong in the medical world today. The movie is enlightening to say the least. Watch this movie and make up your own mind! Don't always look at reviews, as clearly they can be dead wrong! helpful•59 18 jhs-99-390949 Jul 25, 2017 Details Edit Release date June 22, 2018 (United States) Countries of origin United States Canada Ireland Official sites Official site Official site (Japan) Language English Also known as Ma & Chiếc Đồng Hồ Filming locations Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada Production companies Denver and Delilah Productions Broad Green Pictures Foundation Features See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross worldwide $10,846 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 28 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 2.39 : 1 Related news Charlize Theron Signs First-Look TV Deal With HBO and HBO Max Dec 1The Wrap ‘Brain on Fire’ Trailer: Chloe Grace Moretz is Losing Her Mind and Doctors Don’t Know Why Jun 15Slash Film Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Brazilian Portuguese language plot outline for Brain on Fire (2016)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
