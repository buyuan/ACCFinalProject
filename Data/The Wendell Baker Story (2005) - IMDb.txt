His troubles? He dances around telling her that he loves her, and his idea of work is illegal. He's arrested, imprisoned, and she puts him behind her when she realizes that even prison is just a good excuse for him to play football with the guys. When he is paroled, it's to a job in the "hotel industry" at a board and care home for seniors, where the head nurse is running a scam. Three of the residents respond to Wendell's good heart. Can they expose the scam and help Wendell win back Doreen? —<jhailey@hotmail.com> nurseprisonwatching a moviedirectorial debutfantasy sequence60 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Why not call him a hero?

I just saw the world premiere at the Paramount and the crowd was wild for it. I on the other hand, along with all of my friends thought that the movie lacked a lot of what critics call believability. The characters weren't quite paper thin, more like cardboard, and there were about 20 of them. Every time Wendell's charm wained immediately another character would show up to make him look all the better. Every time Wendell had a problem another character would show up to help him. Sometimes characters just showed up for the hell of it. It was a fun movie, I laughed a lot, especially at Will Ferel's bit role. Austin, my city of residence, is also the backdrop which makes everyone feel nice. It seems though that the Wilson brothers were a little too proud of Austin, TX. At one point near the beginning Texas is mentioned, then he turns the corner in his car to show a TX license plate, then another shot as he drives into the distance and a huge Texas flag flutters above. I don't want it to sound like I hated it, but I really wished for more. Luke didn't seem to work out everything quite as well as he could have, he even threw in some random voice over to help the plot hobble along. If you are looking for a fun movie that should have maybe starred Burt Reynolds circa 1972 then this is your movie, if you are looking for a tightly formed narrative then look elsewhere. helpful•28 12 kincannon Mar 12, 2005 Details Edit Release date August 3, 2005 (Belgium) Countries of origin Germany United States Languages English Spanish Also known as Un caradura de confianza Filming locations Austin, Texas, USA Production companies Möbius Entertainment MHF Zweite Academy Film Franchise Pictures See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $8,000,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $127,414 Opening weekend US & Canada $48,120 May 20, 2007 Gross worldwide $153,169 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 39 minutes Color Color Sound mix DTS Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 Related news Billy Joe Shaver Dies: Revered Outlaw Country Singer-Songwriter Was 81 Oct 28Deadline Film + TV Pornhub Offers to Stream Germany’s Oldenburg Film Festival Amid Coronavirus Shutdown (Exclusive) May 13Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was The Wendell Baker Story (2005) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
