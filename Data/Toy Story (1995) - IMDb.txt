But, what do the toys do when Andy is not with them, they come to life. Woody believes that his life (as a toy) is good. However, he must worry about Andy's family moving, and what Woody does not know is about Andy's birthday party. Woody does not realize that Andy's mother gave him an action figure known as Buzz Lightyear, who does not believe that he is a toy, and quickly becomes Andy's new favorite toy. Woody, who is now consumed with jealousy, tries to get rid of Buzz. Then, both Woody and Buzz are now lost. They must find a way to get back to Andy before he moves without them, but they will have to pass through a ruthless toy killer, Sid Phillips. —John Wiggins toytoy comes to liferivalrycowboyclaw crane314 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines "Oooh...3-D" (USA 2009 re-release) Genres Animation Adventure Comedy Family Fantasy Certificate G Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Sid Phillips is said to be inspired by a former Pixar employee of the same last name who was known to disassemble toys and use the parts to build bizarre creations. Goofs Even though Buzz believes he is a real space ranger and not a toy, he still freezes when people are around like the other toys do. Quotes Woody: All right, that's enough! Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy. Buzz: Toy? Woody: T-O-Y, Toy! Buzz: Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is "Space Ranger". Woody: The word I'm searching for - I can't say, because there's preschool toys present. Crazy credits This is the first Pixar film to feature the "Production Babies" section, which lists babies born to the crew members during production. This would become a trademark in the following years, in films like A Bug's Life (1998), Toy Story 2 (1999), Monsters, Inc. (2001) and Finding Nemo (2003). Alternate versions Post-2009 prints of the film (including the Ultra HD Blu-ray release) has the CGI version of the Walt Disney Pictures logo (made specifically for the film and would later be used in many Pixar films at the time) replaced with the 2006 logo as well as including the current version of the Pixar logo which transitions to the opening sequence.

Toy Story is a sheer delight to view on the screen. The characters are well done, the plot is exceptional, and the best thing of all, the film is entirely produced on the computer. The animation is extraordinary in it's ability to bring such great entertainment to the screen. The film also teaches some good lessons for the kids like friendship (mainly between Woody and Buzz Light-year). Spectacular entertainment all around and one of the best films Disney has come with. helpful•54 9 Quinoa1984 Feb 13, 2000 FAQ9 Is it a coincidence Buzz Lightyear and Woody the cowboy have the same names as Woody Woodpecker and his adversary, Buzz Buzzard?As well as the boy who owned Woody and Buzz was Andy, and Woody's best friend was Andy Panda.Is all this a coincidence? What is 'Toy Story' about? Is 'Toy Story' based on a book?
