The caller demands that he release militants in exchange for information about the many bombs planted across Chennai city. The caller is obviously serious as the police find a bomb planted very close the their headquarters. The Police Commissioner is torn between releasing militants who had been responsible for killing innocent people and stopping bomb blasts around the city. What will he do? Or does he have a choice at all? —Happy_Evil_Dude terrorismrighteous ragemuslimpolice commissionercell phone7 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Genres Action Crime Drama Mystery Thriller Certificate Not Rated Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia 'Kamal Haasan' filmed his scenes in 5 days. Goofs In one of the calls made to the commissioner's mobile phone, the protagonist uses his own mobile phone which is placed to his left rather than using the array of temporary, stripped down phones that were arranged on his right exclusively to make these fake calls with fake SIM cards. He could have been easily found out during this call itself. Alternate versions The UK release was cut, the distributor chose to remove one shot in order to obtain a 12A classification. The shot removed depicted a police suspect involuntarily urinating while under interrogation. An uncut 15 classification was available. These cuts were made for the theatrical version, the uncut footage was later restored on the DVD version of the film which was classified 15 without cuts. Connections Referenced in Singam (2010) User reviews13 Review Top review 8/10 Good entertainer with gripping screenplay Brilliant performances from both legends ulaga nayagan and lalettan. This movie is better than Wednesday because of star and production value. Reason kamal gives why he plot to kill terrorists is not convincing, I feel that is the only minus point in the movie. helpful•1 0 MichaelMKR Jun 4, 2020 Details Edit Release date September 18, 2009 (India) Country of origin India Official sites Disney India (India) Official site Languages Tamil Telugu English Malayalam Also known as Someone Like You Production companies Raajkamal Films International Raajkamal Films International UTV Motion Pictures See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross worldwide ₹500,000,000 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 46 minutes Color Color Related news 'Jallikattu', 'Comali', 'Pailwaan' and other new south releases streaming online Nov 4The News Minute Madras Hc lifts stay on Nayanthara's 'Kolayuthir Kaalam' Jun 28The News Minute Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Unnaipol Oruvan (2009) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Most anticipated Indian movies and shows Percentage shows amount of top page views. 1Marakkar: Lion of the Arabian Sea39.9% 2Ram Asur24.0% 3Bunty Aur Babli 28.0% 4RRR5.6% 5Antim: The Final Truth5.1% 6Pushpa: The Rise - Part 14.2% 7Matsya Kaand4.0% 8Satyameva Jayate 23.7% 9Dangerous2.7% 10Minnal Murali2.7% Updates approximately every 20 minutes.
