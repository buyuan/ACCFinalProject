His only available transportation being his father's taxi cab, Naz sets off into Manhattan. But his party-going plans are quickly forgotten when a mysterious young woman jumps aboard in need of a ride. Charmed by her intense intrigue and good looks, Naz gets swept up by her pressures. After a mind-altering night of drugs and passion, the woman is dead, and Naz finds himself in the crosshairs of a gruesome murder investigation, panicked and shaken, but possibly with a trace of doubt as to his own innocence. —copperheadache murder investigationeczemamuslimrikers island new york citybased on british tv series12 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines What happened Genres Crime Drama Mystery Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia HBO originally passed on the pilot. HBO later picked up the series after James Gandolfini and Steven Zaillian agreed to make a mini-series instead of an open-ended series. Gandolfini died suddenly a month later. Goofs A murder like this sprays blood everywhere (as can be seen in the crime scene) but at no stage does his defense ask for an explanation of why he wasn't covered in her blood. Connections Featured in The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon: Jared Leto/John Turturro/Bishop Briggs (2016) User reviews290 Review Top review 9/10 Dramatically convincing and a pleasantly dark atmosphere (Revelry Review) HBO's new crime drama 'The Night Of' has sucked me in right from the very beginning. The pilot starts up very slow but builds suspense as it starts to tell the story, and that's where it shines; in it's storytelling. It was dramatically convincing and had a pleasantly dark atmosphere. The pilot was very long (1hr 20min) but it felt much shorter, it was tense from start to finish, in the sense of the story it was actually very predictable, but it was the acting and how the story was portrayed that made it so gripping and watchable. Not a second went by where my attention wasn't glued to the TV screen. What really made me love the pilot was how REAL the story felt, there wasn't a moment that made me think that it was a stupid story, it felt REAL. The acting was superb by everyone, the cinematography was perfect with it's overall dark tone and lighting, and the music just set the scene playing in the background to the tone of the show. The overall mood of the show has been set for the series, and if it stays at this standard for the rest of the series it will be an ultimate success. I look forward to where the rest of this series takes us!
