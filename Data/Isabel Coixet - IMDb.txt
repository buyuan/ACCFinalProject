Personal Quote: I'm comfortable with the word 'feminist' because half the world isn't getting what it deserves. Women blame themselves for everything that is wrong, and men never do that. We have to stop blaming ourselves for what we don't have and start asking for what we deserve - whether it's more money or more work or whatever.
