Willow Wilson, the co-creator of the Kamala Khan version of Ms. Marvel, told Polygon she is worried that the upcoming live-action "Ms. Marvel" series on Disney+ is going to have a hard time depicting her super-powered abilities. She said: "I think there're some characters who are very much set up for the big screen; they're very naturally sort of cinematic. But with Ms. Marvel, we really weren't interested in creating something that had very obvious film potential. She's got very comic booky powers." Ms. Marvel's superpower is the ability to make any part of her body grow much bigger. "God bless them trying to bring that to live-action. I don't know how that's going to work out in a way that doesn't look really creepy."
