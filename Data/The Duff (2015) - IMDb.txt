Goofs When Madison is giving out her party invitations, Caitlyn is supposedly recording the interaction for Madison's YouTube channel, however for the majority of the scene she is holding her phone incorrectly and her hand is covering the camera. Quotes Toby Tucker: The song was mine. Bianca Piper: Yeah I'm not surprised cause it was a piece of shit... and so are you. Crazy credits At the start of the closing credits there is a gag reel in between introducing each actor/actress. Alternate versions The UK theatrical version cuts a "strong sexual reference" to achieve a lower age rating. BBFC says: "During post-production, the distributor sought and was given advice by the BBFC on how to secure the desired classification in the UK. It was likely to receive a 15 classification but their preferred 12A could be achieved by removing a scene involving strong sex references. When the film was submitted for formal classification, this sequence had been removed and the film was classified 12A."

User reviews163 Review Top review 6/10 Not the next "Mean Girls" by any means but funny and entertaining enough Take a look around and survey your group of friends, are they all good looking? Then you might be the designated ugly fat friend, or the DUFF. Bianca's life becomes undone when someone reveals to her that she is the DUFF to her prettier and more popular high school friends. Frustrated, she retaliates by instigating the status quo and social hierarchy at her school. This comedy finds its laughs as Bianca, played by Mae Whitman, desperately tries to reinvent herself and overcome DUFF status. A chronic DUFF, she can't do it alone, and makes a deal with her neighbor Wesley (Robbie Amell) to undo the damage. A fan of Mae Whitman, Robbie Amell is the clear star of this film. Playing an endearing jock without being a cliché is quite a feat and his performance is scene stealing without being a parody. From that plot alone there is not much to the story within the high school film The Duff. The film injects an archetype antagonist, played by Bella Thorne, the most classic mean girl ever invented. This character's existence is solely responsible for the plot feasibly being stretched to feature film length – otherwise the DUFF would be relegated to a solitary episode plot line on a WB television series. Though briefly marketed as the Mean Girls of the 2010's, it really is in an inferior class in comparison to the phenom that was (and is) Mean Girls. The writing, plot and direction are all ho-hum: funny enough for a one time watch with your girlfriends with popcorn, but that's about it.
