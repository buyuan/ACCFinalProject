Personally i liked it. Kind of like nailed it but not quite. The contestants had to know what they were doing on this kind of show. I liked the fact that all the contestants cheered each other on. Fun light show to watch. helpful•6 3 shirlone Oct 9, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 6, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Netflix Site Language English Also known as مهمّة الخَبز المستحيلة See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Color Color Related news Propagate Ups Isabel San Vargas To Equity Partner; Promotes Biz Affairs Pair Sep 23Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What was the official certification given to Baking Impossible (2021) in Japan?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
