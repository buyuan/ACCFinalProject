I'll be viewing all of these films on TIFF's quite efficient screening service as the pandemic is keeping so many away from Toronto. Here's to hoping that screenings next year take place in the glorious TIFF Lightbox. PS: I did not include Denis Villeneuve's DUNE on this list because, knowing Villeneuve and the source material, that movie has to, has to, has to be seen in a theater. - Keith Simanton Refine See titles to watch instantly, titles you haven't rated, etc Genres Movies or TV IMDb Rating In Theaters Release Year Keywords Drama (24) Biography (6) Thriller (6) Comedy (5) Documentary (4) Romance (4) History (3) Horror (3) Music (3) Sci-Fi (3) Mystery (2) Adventure (1) Animation (1) Crime (1) Musical (1) War (1) Western (1) Feature Film (30) IMDb user rating (average) 1 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 3.0 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 4.0 4.1 4.2 4.3 4.4 4.5 4.6 4.7 4.8 4.9 5.0 5.1 5.2 5.3 5.4 5.5 5.6 5.7 5.8 5.9 6.0 6.1 6.2 6.3 6.4 6.5 6.6 6.7 6.8 6.9 7.0 7.1 7.2 7.3 7.4 7.5 7.6 7.7 7.8 7.9 8.0 8.1 8.2 8.3 8.4 8.5 8.6 8.7 8.8 8.9 9.0 9.1 9.2 9.3 9.4 9.5 9.6 9.7 9.8 9.9 10 to 10 9.9 9.8 9.7 9.6 9.5 9.4 9.3 9.2 9.1 9.0 8.9 8.8 8.7 8.6 8.5 8.4 8.3 8.2 8.1 8.0 7.9 7.8 7.7 7.6 7.5 7.4 7.3 7.2 7.1 7.0 6.9 6.8 6.7 6.6 6.5 6.4 6.3 6.2 6.1 6.0 5.9 5.8 5.7 5.6 5.5 5.4 5.3 5.2 5.1 5.0 4.9 4.8 4.7 4.6 4.5 4.4 4.3 4.2 4.1 4.0 3.9 3.8 3.7 3.6 3.5 3.4 3.3 3.2 3.1 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.2 2.1 2.0 1.9 1.8 1.7 1.6 1.5 1.4 1.3 1.2 1.1 1 Number of votes to » In Favorite Theaters In Theaters Near You Reset Release year or range to » Love (7) Christmas (4) Life (4) Male Nudity (4) Bare Chested Male (3) Based On Novel (3) Based On True Story (3) Blood (3) Dancing (3) Father (3) Female Protagonist (3) Male Frontal Nudity (3) Male Rear Nudity (3) Marriage (3) Mental Illness (3) Mother (3) Netflix Original (3) Parent (3) 1980s (2) 1990s (2) Bare Breasts (2) Character Name As Title (2) Character Name In Title (2) Dream Sequence (2) Female Frontal Nudity (2) Female Nudity (2) Female Rear Nudity (2) Female Serial Killer (2) Fire (2) Flashback (2) Gay (2) Home (2) Horse (2) House (2) Husband Wife Relationship (2) Journey (2) Kissing (2) London England (2) Murder (2) Nightmare (2) One Word Title (2) Playing Piano (2) Police Detective (2) Pregnancy (2) Pregnant Woman (2) Serial Killer (2) Shower (2) Suicide (2) Supernatural Horror (2) Swimming (2) Title Directed By Female (2) Title Spoken By Character (2) Town (2) Violence (2) Voice Over Narration (2) Wife (2) 1800s (1) 1880s (1) 1890s (1) 1900s (1) 1920s (1) 1924 (1) 1960s (1) 1970s (1) 19th Century (1) 20th Century (1) 30th Birthday (1) Accordion Player (1) Actor Shares First Name With Character (1) Addiction (1) Adjusting To College (1) Adulterous Affair (1) Advocacy For Lgbt (1) Affair With A Maid (1) Afghanistan (1) Agricultural Show (1) Aids (1) Aids Patient (1) Airport (1) Alarm Clock (1) Alcoholic (1) American Remake (1) American Remake Of Danish Film (1) American Remake Of European Film (1) Animal Lead (1) Animals Gone Bad (1) Annoying Roommate (1) Apple Orchard (1) Archive Footage (1) Archives (1) Artist (1) Artist As Protagonist (1) Asperger's Syndrome (1) Aspiring Singer (1) Assumed Identity (1) Assuming Someone's Identity (1) Attempted Stabbing (1) Audition (1) Autism (1) Avarice (1) Sort by: List Order Popularity Alphabetical IMDb Rating Number of Votes Release Date Runtime Date Added View: 30 titles 1.

When his brother brings home a new wife and her son, Phil torments them until he finds himself exposed to the possibility of love. Director: Jane Campion | Stars: Benedict Cumberbatch, Kirsten Dunst, Jesse Plemons, Kodi Smit-McPhee Votes: 3,948 Reasons? Campion, of course, with Cumberbatch, Dunst, Plemons. Reviews coming out of Venice have been mixed but a few, from folks I trust, have been stellar and there was that four-minute standing ovation in the Sala Grande, the large, premiere theater. And they're not pushovers in that theater. You have to earn an ovation there. 2. Belfast (2021) PG-13 | 98 min | Drama 7.8 0 Rate 1 Rate 2 Rate 3 Rate 4 Rate 5 Rate 6 Rate 7 Rate 8 Rate 9 Rate 10 Rate 0 Error: please try again. 82 Metascore A young boy and his working class family experience the tumultuous late 1960s. Director: Kenneth Branagh | Stars: Jude Hill, Lewis McAskie, Caitriona Balfe, Jamie Dornan Votes: 1,715 Every few years I'll get some drink and watch HENRY V. Some sobbing is usually involved. I imagine that, if Mr. Branagh manages to not get maudlin in this tale that sounds very autobiographical (named after the city of his birth), more sobbing will be called for. The film reminds me, without having seen it, of Boorman's HOPE AND GLORY. Early reviews from Telluride call BELFAST the first sure-fire Best Picture contender. 3. The Forgiven (III) (2021) 117 min | Drama 6.7 0 Rate 1 Rate 2 Rate 3 Rate 4 Rate 5 Rate 6 Rate 7 Rate 8 Rate 9 Rate 10 Rate 0 Error: please try again. 67 Metascore The Forgiven takes place over a weekend in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco, and explores the reverberations of a random accident on the lives of both the local Muslims, and Western visitors to a house party in a grand villa. Director: John Michael McDonagh | Stars: Caleb Landry Jones, Jessica Chastain, Ralph Fiennes, Matt Smith Votes: 69 Love John Michael McDonagh (THE GUARD, CALVARY) and this cast is a ridiculous assemblage of superb-ness. His brother, Martin, finally had his big hit with THEE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE OF EBBING, MISSOURI in 2017. Will this be John's? 4. The Eyes of Tammy Faye (2021) PG-13 | 126 min | Biography, Drama, History 6.8 0 Rate 1 Rate 2 Rate 3 Rate 4 Rate 5 Rate 6 Rate 7 Rate 8 Rate 9 Rate 10 Rate 0 Error: please try again. 55 Metascore An intimate look at the extraordinary rise, fall and redemption of televangelist Tammy Faye Bakker. Director: Michael Showalter | Stars: Jessica Chastain, Andrew Garfield, Cherry Jones, Vincent D'Onofrio Votes: 3,598 Having done a senior English paper on Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker (as they imploded, long before her redemption) I can't think of better casting for these two lost souls. Can director Showalter (THE BIG SICK) bring the gravitas needed to keep it from devolving into kitsch? 5. Dear Evan Hansen (2021) PG-13 | 137 min | Drama, Musical 6.1 0 Rate 1 Rate 2 Rate 3 Rate 4 Rate 5 Rate 6 Rate 7 Rate 8 Rate 9 Rate 10 Rate 0 Error: please try again. 39 Metascore Film adaptation of the Tony and Grammy Award-winning musical about Evan Hansen, a high school senior with Social Anxiety disorder and his journey of self-discovery and acceptance following the suicide of a fellow classmate. Director: Stephen Chbosky | Stars: Ben Platt, Julianne Moore, Kaitlyn Dever, Amy Adams Votes: 7,159 I love this Tony-winning Best Musical from Pasek and Paull (who did the music for THE GREATEST SHOWMAN). And yes, I admit, I flinched seeing the remarkable Ben Platt looking like a digital botox victim in the trailer. And I'm worried about having Stephen Chbosky at the helm because he seems to be able to make one-half of a great film (WONDER, PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER). But damn all that. I won't care and I'll love it. I hope. 6. Encounter (III) (2021) R | 108 min | Sci-Fi, Thriller 6.6 0 Rate 1 Rate 2 Rate 3 Rate 4 Rate 5 Rate 6 Rate 7 Rate 8 Rate 9 Rate 10 Rate 0 Error: please try again. 61 Metascore Two brothers embark on a journey with their father, who is trying to protect them from an alien threat. Director: Michael Pearce | Stars: Janina Gavankar, Rory Cochrane, Octavia Spencer, Riz Ahmed Votes: 184 It opened Telluride to reviews that clearly indicated confusion on the part of the critics. What was this film supposed to be? That sounds a lot like the early reviews for SOUND OF METAL and NIGHTCRAWLER, both which transcended the early misgivings, both with the incredible Riz Ahmed. 7. Verdens verste menneske (2021) R | 127 min | Comedy, Drama 8.2 0 Rate 1 Rate 2 Rate 3 Rate 4 Rate 5 Rate 6 Rate 7 Rate 8 Rate 9 Rate 10 Rate 0 Error: please try again. 88 Metascore The chronicles of four years in the life of Julie, a young woman who navigates the troubled waters of her love life and struggles to find her career path, leading her to take a realistic look at who she really is. Director: Joachim Trier | Stars: Renate Reinsve, Anders Danielsen Lie, Mia McGovern Zaini, Maria Grazia Di Meo Votes: 2,458 Enraptured. That's what the reviews coming out of Cannes felt like. That the reviewers had been enraptured. It also landed Renate Reinsve a win for Best Actress. From director Joachim Trier (OSLO, AUGUST 31st, THELMA). 8. Last Night in Soho (2021) R | 116 min | Drama, Horror, Mystery 7.5 0 Rate 1 </div> Rate 2 Rate 3 Rate 4 Rate 5 Rate 6 Rate 7 Rate 8 Rate 9 Rate 10 Rate 0 Error: please try again. 65 Metascore An aspiring fashion designer is mysteriously able to enter the 1960s where she encounters a dazzling wannabe singer. But the glamour is not all it appears to be and the dreams of the past start to crack and splinter into something darker. Director: Edgar Wright | Stars: Thomasin McKenzie, Anya Taylor-Joy, Matt Smith, Diana Rigg Votes: 23,719 Writer/director Edgar Wright (SHAUN OF THE DEAD, BABY DRIVER) seems out on a limb here but that's usually where he flourishes. I'm a big fan of both Anya Taylor-Joy and Thomasin McKenzie (the girl in JOJO RABBIT) and it appears to be the last role for Diana Rigg. Unmissable. 9. Yi miao zhong (2020) 104 min | Drama, History 7.2 0 Rate 1 Rate 2 Rate 3 Rate 4 Rate 5 Rate 6 Rate 7 Rate 8 Rate 9 Rate 10 Rate 0 Error: please try again. 79 Metascore A movie fan in a remote farmland strikes a relationship with a homeless female vagabond. Director: Yimou Zhang | Stars: Yi Zhang, Haocun Liu, Wei Fan, Ailei Yu Votes: 931 All of the powers of legendary director, Zhang Yimou (RAISE THE RED LANTERN, HOUSE OF THE FLYING DAGGERS), appear to be on display here. Near the end of China's Cultural Revolution a man escapes a labor camp for a glimpse of his beloved daughter. She has been immortalized onscreen in a propaganda newsreel as a model worker for the very political system which enslaves him. 10. Spencer (2021) R | 117 min | Biography, Drama 7.3 0 Rate 1 Rate 2 Rate 3 Rate 4 Rate 5 Rate 6 Rate 7 Rate 8 Rate 9 Rate 10 Rate 0 Error: please try again. 77 Metascore During her Christmas holidays with the royal family at the Sandringham estate in Norfolk, England, Diana Spencer, struggling with mental health problems, decides to end her decade-long marriage to Prince Charles. Director: Pablo Larraín | Stars: Kristen Stewart, Timothy Spall, Jack Nielen, Freddie Spry Votes: 6,892 I'll admit, I'm hoping director Larrain, who made the impressive still-life that was JACKIE, gooses this movie up a bit. Makes it move. Injects some passion instead of restraint. Regardless I'm sure it will be a signature tour de force by Stewart, who has, to our collective shame, never been nominated for an Oscar (or even a lousy Globe! not that she probably laments that). Let's fix that. 11. Ghahreman (2021) PG-13 | 127 min | Drama, Thriller 6.9 0 Rate 1 Rate 2 Rate 3 Rate 4 Rate 5 Rate 6 Rate 7 Rate 8 Rate 9 Rate 10 Rate 0 Error: please try again. 78 Metascore Rahim is in prison because of a debt he was unable to repay. During a two-day leave, he tries to convince his creditor to withdraw his complaint against the payment of part of the sum. But things don't go as planned . Director: Asghar Farhadi | Stars: Amir Jadidi, Mohsen Tanabandeh, Fereshteh Sadre Orafaiy, Sarina Farhadi Votes: 6,023 I adore Asghar Farhadi. A SEPARATION was one of my favorite films of the first 20 years of the new millennium. Plus the guy won the Grand Prix at Cannes, so there's that. 12. The Middle Man (2021) 95 min | Drama 6.6 0 Rate 1 Rate 2 Rate 3 Rate 4 Rate 5 Rate 6 Rate 7 Rate 8 Rate 9 Rate 10 Rate 0 Error: please try again. Frank Farrelli takes on the job as a middle man in the God-forsaken town of Karmack, USA, a community in a depression so deep that they need a middle man to professionally communicate more of the bad news. Director: Bent Hamer | Stars: Don McKellar, Kenneth Welsh, Nina Andresen Borud, Nicolas Bro Votes: 79 Director Bent Hamer did FACTOTUM, a film based on the book by Charles Bukowski starring Matt Dillon. While FACTOTUM is no BARFLY it's still a terrific movie about a shambling mess of man, a terrific drunk, who is also quite gifted as a writer. Hamer is quite gifted as a director. 13. Becoming Cousteau (2021) PG-13 | 94 min | Documentary, Adventure, Biography 6.9 0 Rate 1 Rate 2 Rate 3 Rate 4 Rate 5 Rate 6 Rate 7 Rate 8 Rate 9 Rate 10 Rate 0 Error: please try again. 75 Metascore A look at the life, passions, achievements and tragedies surrounding the famous explorer and environmentalist Jacques Cousteau, featuring an archive of his newly restored footage. Director: Liz Garbus | Stars: Vincent Cassel, Jacques-Yves Cousteau Votes: 187 Liz Garbus has been nominated twice for an Oscar, for 1998's THE FARM: ANGOLA, USA, and 2015's WHAT HAPPENED, MISS SIMONE. She's a thoughtful and fluid filmmaker and she's looking into the life of a man I didn't fully appreciate at the time. 14. Titane (2021) R | 108 min | Drama, Horror, Sci-Fi 6.8 0 Rate 1 Rate 2 Rate 3 Rate 4 Rate 5 Rate 6 Rate 7 Rate 8 Rate 9 Rate 10 Rate 0 Error: please try again. 74 Metascore Following a series of unexplained crimes, a father is reunited with the son who has been missing for 10 years. Titane: A metal highly resistant to heat and corrosion, with high tensile strength alloys. Director: Julia Ducournau | Stars: Vincent Lindon, Agathe Rousselle, Garance Marillier, Laïs Salameh Votes: 15,749 Not often you see the winner of the Palme d'Or in the Midnight Madness section. This is also, a must. 15. Montana Story (2021) 113 min | Drama 7.8 0 Rate 1 Rate 2 Rate 3 Rate 4 Rate 5 Rate 6 Rate 7 Rate 8 Rate 9 Rate 10 Rate 0 Error: please try again. 78 Metascore Follows two estranged siblings as they return home to the sprawling ranch they once knew and loved. Directors: Scott McGehee, David Siegel | Stars: Haley Lu Richardson, Owen Teague, Gilbert Owuor, Kimberly Guerrero Votes: 38 McGehee and Siegel, a well-regarded duo who attract undeniable talent came closest to breaking out from beyond the festival circuit with WHAT MAISE KNEW. Perhaps this will be their true breakout. Plus Richardson and Teague are pretty great. 16. The Survivor (2021) 129 min | Biography, Drama 7.5 0 Rate 1 Rate 2 Rate 3 Rate 4 Rate 5 Rate 6 Rate 7 Rate 8 Rate 9 Rate 10 Rate 0 Error: please try again. 68 Metascore Post World War II, Harry Haft is a boxer who fought fellow prisoners in the concentration camps to survive.

See full summary » Director: Barry Levinson | Stars: Billy Magnussen, Peter Sarsgaard, Danny DeVito, John Leguizamo Votes: 56 Is there a more talented actor out there than Ben Foster? Happy to debate. Plus, I'd love to see Barry Levinson have one more ride around the crazy pole of a popular movie. 17. Jagged (2021) 99 min | Documentary, Music 5.7 0 Rate 1 Rate 2 Rate 3 Rate 4 Rate 5 Rate 6 Rate 7 Rate 8 Rate 9 Rate 10 Rate 0 Error: please try again. Documentary centers on the life and work of Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette while making her breakout album 'Jagged Little Pill' Director: Alison Klayman | Stars: Alanis Morissette, Taylor Hawkins, Shirley Manson, Kevin Smith Votes: 42 Director Alison Klayman directed Ai Weiwei's NEVER SORRY plus I'm a sucker for music docs. 18. Listening to Kenny G (2021) 97 min | Documentary, Music 8 0 Rate 1 Rate 2 Rate 3 Rate 4 Rate 5 Rate 6 Rate 7 Rate 8 Rate 9 Rate 10 Rate 0 Error: please try again. 85 Metascore An examination of the most popular instrumentalist of all time, Kenny G, and why he is polarizing to so many. Director: Penny Lane | Stars: Kenny G, James Gardiner Votes: 23 The plot synopsis on this has me intrigued with a question I often ask myself: "what makes music good or bad?" Penny Lane directed HAIL SATAN, btw. 19. Ich bin dein Mensch (2021) R | 108 min | Comedy, Romance, Sci-Fi 7.1 0 Rate 1 Rate 2 Rate 3 Rate 4 Rate 5 Rate 6 Rate 7 Rate 8 Rate 9 Rate 10 Rate 0 Error: please try again. 78 Metascore In order to obtain research funds for her studies, a scientist accepts an offer to participate in an extraordinary experiment: for three weeks, she is to live with a humanoid robot, created to make her happy. Director: Maria Schrader | Stars: Maren Eggert, Dan Stevens, Sandra Hüller, Hans Löw Votes: 2,598 I eagerly await the film that finally leverages all of the skills that Dan Stevens possesses. 20.

Director: Antoine Fuqua | Stars: Jake Gyllenhaal, Riley Keough, Peter Sarsgaard, Christina Vidal Votes: 85,861 It will be hard, even for talents like Fuqua, Pizzolatto, and Gyllenhaal, to match the one-man-act, force of nature that director Gustav Möller and Jakob Cedergren brought to bear in the original 2018 GUILTY from Denmark. 21. Wolf (II) (2021) R | 98 min | Drama, Mystery, Thriller 4.2 0 Rate 1 Rate 2 Rate 3 Rate 4 Rate 5 Rate 6 Rate 7 Rate 8 Rate 9 Rate 10 Rate 0 Error: please try again. A high-concept arthouse drama about a boy who believes he is a wolf. Director: Nathalie Biancheri | Stars: Lily-Rose Depp, George MacKay, Paddy Considine, Martin McCann Votes: 253 George MacKay, one of our finest, most electric young actors (CAPTAIN FANTASTIC, 1917) is in it. 22. Mothering Sunday (2021) R | 104 min | Drama, Romance 6.3 0 Rate 1 Rate 2 Rate 3 Rate 4 Rate 5 Rate 6 Rate 7 Rate 8 Rate 9 Rate 10 Rate 0 Error: please try again. 70 Metascore A maid living in post-World War I England secretly plans to meet with the man she loves before he leaves to marry another woman. Director: Eva Husson | Stars: Olivia Colman, Colin Firth, Josh O'Connor, Odessa Young Votes: 352 Sony Pictures Classics has this so it already has the "need to check it out" stamp. O'Connor and Young sound like a magnetic pair. 23.

Perfect except for one thing: everyone is going to die. Director: Camille Griffin | Stars: Annabelle Wallis, Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, Lily-Rose Depp Votes: 263 Well, this sounds irresistible. On Christmas Eve friends and family head to the home of Nell (Keira Knightley) and Simon (Matthew Goode) to celebrate. But, in a twist either delicious or grotesque, everyone knows they're going to die. A poisonous gas cloud is descending on the UK and no one will be spared. Ho-ho-ho. As a fan of SEEKING A FRIEND AT THE END OF THE WORLD I'm wondering what drew Knightley to slightly familiar ground. And I have to assume it's because it's damn original. 24.

Director: Terence Davies | Stars: Jeremy Irvine, Kate Phillips, Julian Sands, Peter Capaldi Votes: 158 Okay, okay, I'll admit that I often find the films of Terence Davies to be a bit...um, stuffy, but I think I could use stuffy in these crazed times. 25. The Electrical Life of Louis Wain (2021) PG-13 | 111 min | Biography, Drama, History 6.8 0 Rate 1 Rate 2 Rate 3 Rate 4 Rate 5 Rate 6 Rate 7 Rate 8 Rate 9 Rate 10 Rate 0 Error: please try again. 62 Metascore English artist Louis Wain rises to prominence at the end of the 19th century for his surreal cat paintings that seemed to reflect his declining sanity. Director: Will Sharpe | Stars: Benedict Cumberbatch, Claire Foy, Andrea Riseborough, Toby Jones Votes: 3,254 A "dazzling, career-best performance" The TIFF guide called it Louis Wain, "dazzling, career-best performance?" Well, I'm put my BIG EYES reservations aside. 26.

Director: Thyrone Tommy | Stars: Thomas Antony Olajide, Emma Ferreira, Andrea Davis, Andrea Pavlovic Votes: 18 This is the feature debut of the director Tommy but its two leads, Thomas Antony Olaj and Emma Ferreira, are two of TIFF's Rising Stars (which recognizes, often quite accurately, talent on the rise whose names you'll know several years from now). 27.

While quarantining, the relationship between a mother and daughter takes an unexpected turn. Director: Mong-Hong Chung | Stars: Alyssa Chia, Gingle Wang, Lee-zen Lee, Yi-wen Chen Votes: 210 Director Chung Mong-hong made A SUN, a film that seemingly was only discovered domestically once it hit Netflix, landing in the Oscar Short List for Best International Features (though it didn't make the final five). 28.

And will I be able to NOT imagine that this is really THE ICE STORM sequel? 29.
