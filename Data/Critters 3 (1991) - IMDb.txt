Connections Edited from Critters (1986) User reviews55 Review Top review 5/10 Flesh-eating alien hedgehogs versus li'l Leo. A group of people find themselves face-to-face with the ravenous, intergalactic toothy terrors known as Krites, and must battle for their lives—this time in a run down, inner-city tenement block. Help eventually arrives in the form of heavily armed Krite hunter Charlie (Don Opper) and chaos ensues. Critters 3 is most notable for being the less-than-auspicious movie debut of triple Oscar-nominated, Hollywood A-lister Leonardo DiCaprio. Unsurprisingly, Leo acquits himself rather well, doing all one could really ask of a kid acting opposite crap hand puppets, but with the script being little more than an uninspired rehash of elements from the previous two efforts, even the acting talent of DiCaprio cannot prevent this from being very mediocre B-movie nonsense. Also starring a young Aimee Brooks, the total hottie from 2003 horror flick Monster Man, and Joseph and Christian Cousins, who played the sickeningly cute kid from Kindergarten Cop. helpful•2 2 BA_Harrison May 20, 2011 Details Edit Release date January 24, 1992 (Turkey) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Critters 3: You Are What They Eat Filming locations Los Angeles, California, USA Production companies New Line Cinema OH Films See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 26 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Netflix Is Adding 3 Great Leonardo DiCaprio Movies Next Month Dec 17We Got This Covered ‘Ammonite’ Director Francis Lee Reveals He’s Working On A Horror Movie Next Dec 12The Playlist Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Critters 3 (1991) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
