Connections Featured in IMDb on the Scene - Interviews: Invincible (2021) User reviews711 Review Top review 9/10 I don't like it, I love it. Great voice cast and a very good story makes this series a must if you are a fan of the superhero genre . I know this is from a comic dated around 2003 but i never read it and it doesn't matter. You can enjoy this without any prior info; its still pretty darn good. Maybe you will need to be a bit patient for the story to clearly develop at the end of the 1st episode. From that point on, it's a winner. The story arc between mother, father and son is excellent. And further on some of the characters which you will encounter are just phenomenal; Machine head, Robot, Rexplode and Cecil are just a few. They are also voiced by an amazing selection of actors which will entertain you. Let alone the world building; one of the best in the superhero genre. And yes...it's super woke, but so what? It didn't affect the main story line and the connection between the characters. Just keep in mind that this is an adult show due to the violence. 9/10 for the great voice cast and good story. Give it a go. helpful•193 60 ThomDerd May 3, 2021 Details Edit Release date March 26, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Невколупний Filming locations Chicago Illinois, USA Production companies Amazon Studios Image Comics Skybound Entertainment See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 50 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news UK-Ireland box office preview: ‘Cry Macho’, ‘Mothering Sunday’ take on strong holdovers Nov 12ScreenDaily Every IndieWire TV Review from 2021 So Far, Ranked by Best to Worst Grade Nov 8Indiewire Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
