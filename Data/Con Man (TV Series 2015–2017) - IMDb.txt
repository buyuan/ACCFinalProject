Wray's good friend Jack Moore, who starred as the ship's captain, has become an A-list movie star. Frustrated by Jack's success and his lack thereof, Wray travels the science fiction convention circuit, makes appearances at comic book stores, and visits pop culture events. He navigates the odd people and incidents he encounters along the way while learning to love the fans he has. —Anonymous web seriesfansactorblack comedysci fi convention5 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Because "Convention Man" doesn't sound as cool. Genre Comedy Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia Series stars Nathan Fillion and Alan Tudyk (who both appeared in the sci-fi series "Firefly") raised money for this project through crowdfunding on Indiegogo. Originally asking for about $425,000 they ended up with $3,156,179 pledged. Alternate versions In mid-2017, SyFy Channel showed an all-day marathon of Season 1, claiming that the series was left completely uncut. However, while the language is left uncut, the nudity is censored. Connections Referenced in Geeks Who Drink: iJustine vs. Alan Tudyk (2015) User reviews17 Review Top review 10/10 I think it's hilarious The show feels a lot like Spiner's Fresh Hell or at least the basic idea does. However, the production value and the list of guest stars (which is basically the a Who's Who list of fan favorites in the sci-fi / fantasy genre) are miles ahead in Con Man and the story and characters are overall a lot funnier. The premise of the show is about a sci-fi actor who's entire career is defined by his role in a short lived TV show and how he struggles with this "creative-stigma" on a daily basis. The humor mostly comes from scenes between Tudyk and convention fans, convention volunteers, his booking agent and other actors in his circle. And the anecdotal aspect of it (since Tudyk plays a parody of himself) makes this show extremely funny and I had to pause a couple of times to recover from laughter before continuing to watch. Though, in my opinion it also has enough funny material for people who aren't familiar with Firefly and Tudyk to make it just as entertaining to watch. helpful•53 6 tmf084 Oct 15, 2015 Details Edit Release date September 15, 2015 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Конмэн Production companies Con Man Productions Redbear Films, Inc See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 12 minutes Color Color Sound mix Mono Aspect ratio 1.33 : 1 Related news ‘New-Gen’: Henry Rollins Joins Voice Cast Of Animated Series As Deadalus Sep 21Deadline Film + TV Maya Rudolph becomes first actor in Emmy history to be nominated against herself for guest acting Jul 28Gold Derby Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Con Man (2015) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
