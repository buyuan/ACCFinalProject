Michael Palin was asked to be the host, but he didn't feel he was right for the role. After Fry and Davies settled into their roles, the idea of having two teams was discarded. Goofs The photograph of the piece of knitting with "I woolly love you" in Morse Code knitted into it is shown upside down. This is particularly noticeable because the O in you (dash dash dash) and the I (dot dot), are in the wrong places. Quotes Stephen Fry: [quoting Albert Einstein] Only two things are infinite - the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not so sure about the universe. Crazy credits The researchers who provide the questions and information for Stephen Fry are credited as "QI Elves" which is how they are referred to on the show. Occasionally they are also given other interesting titles like "Curator of Jack and Jill" These can be seen in the "Cast And Crew". Alternate versions Occasionally the arrangement of the opening/end credits music would be modified slightly to match the theme of that particular show. So, for instance, when the given topic was something like "All things french", an accordion would be heard prominently in the mix. But perhaps the most obvious case of modification would be in the "Holiday Special", where in addition to jingle-bells being added, the first two lines from the song by that same name were cleverly integrated into the music - thus adding three more notes to the second line of the main melody. Connections Featured in TV's 50 Greatest Stars (2006) User reviews26 Review Top review Very good I have often heard Stephen Fry accused of being pleased with himself for being so clever. This implies that there is something intrinsically wrong with being clever. QI is a perfect vehicle for Fry and others to show how clever and witty they are. And why not? You know, if I was as clever and witty as Stephen Fry. I would be pleased with myself too. As for the complaints about the intelligence and wit being sullied by smut, remember that many of us LIKE smut. The difference between fans and opponents of smut, is that you are unlikely to hear comments on 'Points Of View' complaining about a paucity of dirty jokes. So keep the smut forthcoming please. There should be enough facts in the world to keep this show going for a while yet. helpful•68 4 tonygillan Nov 6, 2003 FAQ2 What is visible in the opening sequence?
