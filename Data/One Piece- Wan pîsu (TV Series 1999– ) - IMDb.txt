Roger. He obtained wealth, fame, and power to earn the title of Pirate King. When he was captured and about to be executed, he revealed that his treasure called One Piece was hidden somewhere at the Grand Line. This made all people set out to search and uncover the One Piece treasure, but no one ever found the location of Gol D. Roger's treasure, and the Grand Line was too dangerous a place to overcome. Twenty-two years after Gol D. Roger's death, a boy named Monkey D. Luffy decided to become a pirate and search for Gol D. Roger's treasure to become the next Pirate King. —J LeGault pirateanimetreasurenavigatordoctor57 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Set sail for One Piece! Genres Animation Action Adventure Comedy Drama Fantasy Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia In a Manga collaboration with Dragon ball, Luffy was able to ride Goku's cloud which means Luffy had a pure heart. Goofs Leo shows an eager reaction when Sugar picks the poisoned grape out of her grape bowl. All the grapes look identical so from the spot where he and Robin are hiding it would be impossible to see which grape was the spiked one. Quotes Monkey D. Luffy: I'm the man who's going to be the Pirate King! Alternate versions The US version from 2004-2006 is heavily edited over the Japanese version. All blood is removed, all guns are changed to non-lethal weapons (pop guns, squirt guns, etc.), all alcohol is changed to juice, and all cigarettes are changed to lollipops, among other changes. When Funimation took over the dub production in 2007, it was a lot more faithful to the original.

One piece recently celebrated it's 20th anniversary which started it's legacy in 1999 by the creator eiichiro oda. It is set in a beautiful yet harsh world where pirates raise their flags high Expressing their freedom and sail the waters in the search of the grand treasure "One Piece" left behind by the Pirate King Gol d. Roger which marks the beginning Of "the great pirate era." While the marines fend off pirates in order to protect civilians with their own sense of justice. The ruling system has it's very own dark side which strives the pirates to struggle and fight against it for their freedom. The story follows an ambitious and high spirited young boy Monkey d. Luffy who aims to become the "King of Pirates" by conquering the seas and finding one piece. As he ventures on his quest he makes many allies with never ending bonds and stumbles across enemies, kicking their ass for good and more importantly his crewmates who swore their loyalty to him as their captain and work hard to make their dreams come true. The crew starts their journey in the grand line, the toughest seas that are feared by everyone which only Gol d. Roger was managed to conquer. The Grand line is described as hell and as a nightmare for every pirate which the crew rocks in as the "Strawhat Pirates" named after their captain's hat. One piece has the best adventures, high action, drama and comedy that you can ask for. The bonds and relations between the characters are well built in such a way that if you follow them close enough you are sure to wet your tissues. With beautiful seas, islands and breath taking stunts, nerve wracking epic battles, loads of laughter, great openings and ending tracks and addictive OST's you will never want to miss this out anymore. I am sure you will be loving the crew while they progress towards their goal. Finally One Piece is a best source for inspiration and motivation, the theme of "never give up on your dreams no matter what the cost is" gets the good expression here. Every character of one piece whether it be protagonists or antagonists have their own believes, sense of justice and vision of the world for which they fight for putting them on high stakes. If you want to change your approach or view towards the world then you must watch one piece. It can be undoubtedly crowned as Best of the best shounen series. Their adventures still continue as they unfold various mysteries and cruel fates. At the end of the day don't expect the crew to be all kind, gentle and selfless, they're PIRATES after all helpful•81 6 chandradkiran May 30, 2019 FAQ34 What is the currency in the One Piece world?
