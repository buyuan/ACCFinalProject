Michelle Carter Storyline Edit A groundbreaking six-part documentary directed and produced by Andrew Jarecki and produced and shot by Marc Smerling (the Oscar nominated behind "Capturing the Friedmans (2003)") delves into the strange history of real estate heir Robert Durst, long suspected in the still-unsolved 1982 disappearance of his wife as well as the subsequent murders of family friend Susan Berman and neighbor Morris Black. It features an extended, revealing interview with Durst himself, with whom Jarecki developed a unique relationship following the release of "All Good Things (2010)", Jarecki's 2010 feature about Durst's life starring Ryan Gosling and Kirsten Dunst. "The Jinx" results from nearly a decade of research by the filmmakers, who expose police files, key witnesses, never-before-seen footage, private prison recordings, and thousands of pages of formerly hidden documents. —Jwelch5742 suspicion of murderhusband suspected of murdering his wifehusband suspected of killing his wifetv mini seriesreenactment Plot summary Plot synopsis Genres Documentary Crime Mystery Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia Robert Durst used Doe-Eyed contact lenses during the filming of the documentary to make him appear innocent like a baby deer.

Murder Performed by Eels Courtesy of Vagrant Records User reviews48 Review Top review 10/10 More dramatic than anything you'll find on TV or theater I don't typically watch documentaries and many I often find boring. I also don't typically write reviews. The Jinx however, is the most compelling and dramatic thing I've ever seen. On one side it has the feel of a featured film murder mystery like Gone Girl. Almost seeming written, and even features an amazing intro and theme song similar to True Detective. On the other side you acknowledge this is actually a documentary, and the interviews from the man himself are chilling. For lack of a better comparison , It's like an episode of Dateline NBC on super steroids and 10 times more interesting. I love how it was broken into separate episodes rather than a lengthy one piece.This gives them the ability to leave cliff hangers for the next episode and that makes you want to binge watch(which I did). This series also leaves you wanting more, and you'll find yourself searching the internet for other details about Robert at the case itself. This puts anything else that calls itself "reality television" to shame. Overall, I find it to be more powerful and dramatic than anything I've ever watched in a feature film or on television. helpful•54 5 kumpfcorey Apr 14, 2015 FAQ1 What is happened to Robert Durst after listening to the last record?
