But her boyfriend ditches her when he comes to know that she would be disinherited. Kalyani's father Ramachandra Menon, who stays in US, is unaware of the broken engagement and comes to India to spend his vacation with his newlywed daughter and son in law. This prompts Kaimail (Nedumudi Venu), who takes care of Kalyani, to hire a stranger named Vishnu (Mohanlal) to play the role of Kalyani's husband. But Kalyani's cousin Bhaskaran (Sreenivasan) is aware that Vishnu is not Kalyani's husband and tries to inform Menon about the truth with proof so that he can inherit Menon's wealth. Meanwhile Vishnu and Kalyani never get on well and keep on fighting. But later she develops an affection for him and wishes that she could marry him. But the arrival of a mysterious stranger (M. G. Soman) gives the story a twist as it unfolds Vishnu's past. —Dhanya man wears underweartragic eventimpersonationofficeoffice romance41 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Comedy Drama Musical Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia Holds the record as the longest-running Malayalam film.

Chithram (1988) : Brief Review - A screwball Rom-Com of 30s Hollywood meets bitter facts of Life to form a Timeless Malayalam Classic. Chithram has been considered as one of the finest romantic drama of Mohanlal and Priyadarshan's careers by their fans but is it really a Romantic Drama? Or is it really even a Rom-com? The answer should have been No but seems like that Malayalam audience of 80s wasn't aware of 30s & 40s Hollywood Classics. Indian TVs wouldn't show those Hollywood films then so it was obvious and considering the regional limits of global cinema viewing makes this equation completely irrelevant. For me, Chithram is more easy film review in 2021 that too after seeing almost 1000+ old Hollywood classics because i understand those tactics and know those cliches which were formed almost 50 years before this film was released. I won't name any Old Holywood classic to avoid the comparison but i could feel that Screwball Formula all over while watching Chithram. A woman hires a stranger to pose as her husband because she doesn't want her ailing father to know that her fiance broke their engagement. Well, it doesn't end like those happily ended films to leave audience smiling. Instead, it brings some bitter facts and mistakes of life to leave audience with a stunning reality-check against the mainstream entertainers. The film is not funny actually, i don't know why people even call it a comedy. I'd better say it's an engaging rom-com with sweet and adorable cliches. Mohanlal, Ranjini and Nedumudi Venu are best performers in the film. Dialogues are decent, screenplay is very nicely shaped, music is good and direction is immensely dedicated. Priyadarshan dares to go for a climax which he would know that family audience may not accept but sometimes a gutsy attempt brings you more success than expected. Chithram is prime example of that. Overall, a Classic Drama with no expiry date.
