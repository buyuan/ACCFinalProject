A coastal tanker leaves the Öresund waterway and is headed straight for the Øresund Bridge. When the Coast Guard board the ship they discover there is no crew, and three Swedish and two Danish youths are chained below deck. Saga Norén, County Police, Malmö, is put in charge of the case and contacts Martin Rohde, who is still haunted by the death of his son. Soon it turns out the chained youths were just the beginning... Someone wants to direct our attention to the changing climate and the use of our planet's resources, and will stop at nothing to do it. It all turns into a race against the clock to prevent a disaster where many lives are at stake... —Nimbus Film female protagonistnordic noircopenhagen denmarkbridgebilingual12 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Crime Mystery Thriller Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Danes and Swedes do not always understand each other's languages as well as the series may have you believe. But the creators decided to ignore this fact for the sake of a fluent dialogue. Also when people enunciate their respective languages as well as television actors do, people in the Malmö/Copenhagen region usually do understand each other. Goofs In the opening credits some of the traffic footage is mirrored causing the traffic to be driving on the left instead of the right side of the road and taking the roundabout in a clockwise fashion instead of counter-clockwise. Crazy credits The opening and closing credits appear in both Swedish and Danish, including the series title and descriptive character names.

I would advice readers not to listen to people who didn't even bother watching at least half the series before writing a review. Truth is, the show is a bit of a slow starter. At the end of episode one, I was left with the impression of a fairly mediocre show with an annoying female lead character that is poorly acted. However, one soon realizes that her restrained and unemotional manner is part of her character. Underneath this, Sofia Helin adds subtle nuances and complexity to her character that shows that she is a good actress. The plot also picks up and gets gradually more exciting and entertaining. Contrary to what others suggested, Kim Bodnia (who plays the danish cop) was actually very enthusiastic about this project and had nothing but praise for his female co-star. Needless to say, he is also very good in his role here. So my opinion is that this is a well made series with a complex and entertaining plot, interesting characters and good cinematography. On the negative side, some of the actors playing minor roles are sometimes less than stellar, the plot is far-fetched in places and the sound quality leaves some things to be desired in a few scenes. But with that said, Bron is a very good and well made series. Just make sure to give it a chance beyond the first couple of episodes or so before you decide what to think. Especially the main female character is somewhat unusual and requires some time to get a grasp of. But give it (and her) a chance and you won't regret it. helpful•126 12 SamusPirate Nov 17, 2011 FAQ2 Will there be a fourth season? Will there be a Third Season?
