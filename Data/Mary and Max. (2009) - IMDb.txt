She's Mary Dinkle, the only child of an alcoholic mother and a distracted father. He's Max Horowitz, an overweight man with Asperger's, living alone in New York. He writes back, with chocolate. Thus begins a 20-year correspondence, interrupted by a stay in an asylum and a few misunderstandings. Mary falls in love with a neighbor, saves money to have a birthmark removed and deals with loss. Max has a friendship with a neighbor, tries to control his weight, and finally gets the dream job. Will the two ever meet face to face? —<jhailey@hotmail.com> stop motionblack comedystop motion animationasperger's syndromemale nudity146 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Two unlikely people.

Goofs Part of the movie is set in Australia and part of the movie is set in New York, however, the cars always drive on the left side of the road, even the scene in New York. Quotes Max Jerry Horovitz: The reason I forgive you is because you are not perfect. You are imperfect. And so am I. All humans are imperfect.
