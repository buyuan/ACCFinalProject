Connections Featured in The 33rd Annual Daytime Emmy Awards (2006) User reviews78 Review Top review best talk show yet Normally I am not a big fan of talk shows, not so with Ellen! I love Ellen, her dry humor about everyday situations is hilarious. I love how she opens each show by dancing, and watching the show just puts me in a great mood. I notice most of her guests can't help but laugh at some of her comments! All in all, I have never watched the show without laughing, and I need that every day!!! Nothing is too heavy or depressing, or controversial. I watch this show at every opportunity I have. She is easily one of my favorite comedians, and I am happy to see she has succeeded where many have failed in the talk show business. Keep up the great work Ellen! helpful•23 38 lindahaycock Jan 22, 2005 FAQ2 Is it true that Ellen never invited Cybill Shepherd to her show? How many members are there in the show's audience?
