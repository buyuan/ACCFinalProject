Every negative review is deleted day by day! King Richard is the fantasy story of the father of Venus and Serena Williams. While everyone knows the truth is that their father was a very hard and disciplined taskmaster/father, here in this movie, the father is more like Forest Gump of tennis. King Richard is just a nice goofy dad, making funny jokes and keeping the kids attending their tennis lessons. This movie is a vanity project, all about Will Smith, not really about the Williams sisters. helpful•14 9 Johnny_West Nov 10, 2021 Details Edit Release date November 19, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Official site Language English Also known as King Richard: Huyền Thoại Nhà Williams Filming locations Los Angeles, California, USA Production companies Overbrook Entertainment Star Thrower Entertainment Warner Bros.
