Personal Quote: A lot of practical things keep me motivated, like taking care of my family. On an artistic level, there are stories that I want to tell. I grew up in a storytelling-rich community. It is important to me as a consumer of art and I guess in some ways a wannabe artist to continue that tradition, and acting is my chosen genre at this point to do that.
