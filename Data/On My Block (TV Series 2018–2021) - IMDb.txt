Connections Featured in MsMojo: Top 10 Most Underrated Teen Shows (2019) User reviews181 Review Top review 8/10 Cute Show With Some Serious Topics After the first episode and getting use to the flow, loved it! I watched the entire season in less than 24 hours. The show beings up some serious and modern topics, but more lite. The show focuses more on friendships. helpful•60 7 brneechk Mar 19, 2018 Details Edit Release date March 16, 2018 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Official Netflix Language English Also known as 洛城南區，我的青春 Filming locations Los Angeles, California, USA Production company Crazy Cat Lady Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 30 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 1.78 : 1 Related news Video Exclusive: ‘On My Block’ Star Julio Macias On Showing Leadership In The Latino Community Nov 11Uinterview ‘Squid Game’ Dominance Continues In U.S. Streaming; Dave Chappelle, ‘Seinfeld’, ‘Ted Lasso’ Show Strength Nov 4Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
