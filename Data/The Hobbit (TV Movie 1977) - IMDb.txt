One by one, a whole group of dwarves drop in, and before he knows it, Bilbo has joined their quest to reclaim their kingdom, taken from them by an evil dragon named Smaug. The only problem is that Gandalf has told the dwarves that Bilbo is an expert burglar, but he isn't.... —Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au> treasuremiddle earthbutterflychoruscheer104 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Based on the original version of the Hobbit. Genres Animation Adventure Family Fantasy Musical Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia In the book, Bilbo is knocked unconscious by a falling rock during the Battle of Five Armies immediately after seeing the eagles arrive to help. In the movie, perhaps due to an anti-war bias at the time of filming, Bilbo states that he "simply doesn't understand war" and then hides behind a stone, using the ring to become invisible and watching the entire battle. When asked about his whereabouts Bilbo lies and says that he had "a bump to the head" and was "out for hours". Goofs When Elrond reveals the moon runes on the dwarves' map, he reads the phrased as quoted directly from the book "Stand by the grey stone...", however the phrase shown is "Five feet high the door and three may walk abreast." This is a phrase which was not written in the moon runes. Quotes Bard: Black arrow! You've never failed me, and I've always recovered you. I had you from my father, and he from of old. If ever you came from the forges of the true King under the Mountain, go now and speed well! Crazy credits In the closing credits, an illustration of Bilbo residing in his house is shown as the background. Alternate versions The 2001 DVD release by Warner Brothers omited a number of sound effects from the origianl Sony VHS release. The sound when characters die; when Sting attacks the Spiders in Mirkwood; Smaug's screams as he attacks Lake Town; the flapping of the Thrush's wings in all scenes; when the arrows bounce off of Smaug and when the Black Arrow pierces Smaug's belly; and the howling of the Wargs during the Battle of Five Armies. Connections Featured in Hewy's Animated Movie Reviews: The Top 10 Scariest Animated Monsters (2009) Soundtracks The Greatest Adventure Composed and Performed by Glenn Yarbrough User reviews147 Review Top review 9/10 Rankin-Bass's best ever production... They pulled out all the stops on this one. A glorious ensemble of voices including the legendary John Huston and Otto Preminger gave life to Tolkien's creation while the outstanding folk and fantasy score illuminates the story. You'll see why Frodo was supposed to be an actor in his 50's for the LOTR trilogy (though Peter Jackson's opus was well cast anyway in every position). This will whet your appetite until "Hobbit" is a full-length feature in theatres (fingers crossed) and no doubt, Mr. Jackson and his screenwriters will pull visuals and more from this timeless adaptation. The only shame of it is annually, Rankin-Bass's Christmas offerings are still aired while The Hobbit and its sister production of Return Of The King (starring Roddy McDowell as Samwise The Brave!) aren't. Catch that feature too as it picks up where the Ralph Bakshi stab at The Fellowship Of The Rings/Two Towers left off. -Matt Sherman helpful•24 2 ms-34 Jan 30, 2005 FAQ1 What was Durin's Day?
