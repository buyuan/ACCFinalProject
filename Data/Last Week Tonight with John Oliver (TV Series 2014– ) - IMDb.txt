In doing so, he provides a wry perspective that punctures pomposity and cuts through all pretensions with comically outrageous audacity. In doing so, he can get to the heart of the matter of the world's most serious and absurd problems with plenty of laughs along the way. —Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) news satirehbocurrent affairssatirereenactment9 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Breaking news.

Genres Comedy History News Reality-TV Talk-Show Certificate (Banned) Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia After hosting The Daily Show (1996) for eight weeks, John Oliver's reviews were so overwhelmingly positive that he was offered a job by HBO to do a weekly talk show, which they were not planning to do until they saw Oliver host. Quotes [repeated line] John Oliver - Host: The point is. Alternate versions It is illegal in Great Britain to use video footage of Parliament for comedic purposes. Initially when episodes featuring such footage aired there the screen cut to black without explanation. For later episodes producers would substitute bizarre footage including for example comedian Gilbert Gottfried reading three-star Yelp reviews for restaurants in Boise, Idaho.
