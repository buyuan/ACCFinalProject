Connections Featured in MsMojo: Top 10 Animated Series to Binge Watch While Quarantined (2020) User reviews276 Review Top review 9/10 I didn't think anything could make me care about "New" Harley, I was wrong. As a fan of the original introduction of the character in Batman: The Animated Series I always had a soft spot in my heart for Harley Quinn. Finding out about her relationship with Ivy made me even more happy years later. As a lifelong comic book reader I kept up with Harley and always loved when she would show up in Batman titles. The Margot Robbie version of the character certainly looks right (despite my love of her original costume much more so than other interpretations) but the script she was working with in "Suicide Squad" was laughable. The "New 52" version of Harley is hard to root for as she murders innocents on several occasions. But then this little gem of a show with an all-star cast, terrific animation, and just outright AMAZING writing comes out and makes me want more! I was so sad to realise that this is only a six episode season. I am chomping at the bit for more. I only hope that the comic book version of Harley has come around to reflect this version and isn't just DC's maniacally evil version of Deadpool. Well done, and keep it coming! The writers, cast, and animators on this show deserve a ton of praise! helpful•85 31 rynetate Jan 4, 2020 FAQ2 Will there be a season 3? Come on. When will there be a season 3? We need this.
