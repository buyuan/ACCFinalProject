They soon realize they are trapped inside the cult classic movie and must team up with the fictional and ill-fated "Camp Bloodbath" counselors, including Max's mom as the shy scream queen, to battle the film's machete-wielding, masked killer.

Genres Comedy Drama Fantasy Horror Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG - 13 for horror violence, some crude and sexual material, language and drug use Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The film was conceived and co-written by Joshua John Miller as a way of dealing with the death of his dad, Jason Miller, who had starred as Father Karras in The Exorcist (1973). Goofs When Tina is trying to summon Billy, she dances to Warrant's Cherry Pie. This song didn't come out until September of 1990. The movie took place in 1986. Quotes Kurt: What are you, a fag? Chris Briggs: My dads are gay, so shut the hell up. Kurt: Yeah, right! Gay guys can't have kids! They're too busy going to discos and having sex with each other. It's actually a pretty cool lifestyle. Crazy credits There are bloopers interspersed with the credits, including some of scenes not in the film.

By arrangement with Spirit One Music User reviews201 Review Top review 6/10 Without rules Let's star in a horror movie. A PG-13 horror movie that is based on slasher films. Well if that sounds a bit toothless, I can assure you that many will look upon it that way. There's almost no blood on display (except for one scene) and there are also other "major" ingredients missing. The original plan was to make it an R-rated movie, which did not happen obviously. There are quite a few fun bits of trivia like that in the audio commentary (though according to them only 14 year olds listen to them - another joke in case that wasn't clear). Now up until now that may all have sounded quite harsh, which was not my intention. The movie is good fun, but I wanted to make sure people know what they get themselves into (no pun intended). A CGI crash early on in the movie is quite well done and nice to watch. As are the characters, that are a bit of a parody of whatever went on in the 80s. The actors have a lot of fun and it shows. Still there are too many conveniences and coincidences, an ending that tries to be clever and other things you'll either like or be annoyed by. Try to watch it without thinking too much and you'll have a good time - do not compare it with things like Cabin in the Woods though helpful•9 0 kosmasp Jul 13, 2019 Details Edit Release date November 5, 2015 (Australia) Countries of origin United States Canada Official sites Official Facebook Official Twitter Language English Also known as Останні дівчата Filming locations Frostop Root Beer - 402 Government St Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA Production companies Groundswell Productions Studio Solutions Ulterior Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $6,538,513 (estimated) See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 31 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Stereo Aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 Related news Screen Media Acquires Rights To Romantic Comedy ‘A Week In Paradise’ Starring Malin Akerman & Connie Nielsen Nov 5Deadline Film + TV ‘Search Party’: HBO Max Comedy Adds Seven To Season 5 Cast Oct 29Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Hindi language plot outline for The Final Girls (2015)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
