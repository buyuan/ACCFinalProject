This is a solid MCU movie! 7 November 2021 - 73 out of 124 users found this review helpful. I don't get all the negative reviews. I went into this with low expectations because of what I'd read from critics but I was pleasantly surprised. The cast did a great job and I found each of the characters to be very likeable especially Kumail Nanjiaji who I thought was the best part of the movie. Go into this one with an open mind and you won't be disappointed it's a solid Marvel movie!

Inferior to the 1978 classic which I consider to be the greatest horror film ever made but still a solid sequel. I think obviously there are certain parts that are a little silly like the Laurie bring Michael's sister sub plot but you know what as a two parter this is pretty good. After seeing Halloween Kills I also have a new found respect for this one. Check it out!

Firstly I'm a friends fanatic I absolutely love the show and have watched it over so many times and will watch it over many more and to hear they were doing a reunion I was so excited. But first of all when James Corden comes out you know this isn't going to be the reunion everyone was hoping for... Why did this even need a host??? The best parts of this reunion were the cast doing the quiz and talking about old times, that was the reunion I wanted to see. What I didn't want to see was random celebrities yammering on and what is annoying is that the random celebrities got more screen time than the actual cast!! For instance the lady who played Janice hardly got a chance to speak and what about the guy who played Gunther??? Honestly I think he said about three words then they cut him off!! Overall there were parts which I really enjoyed and those parts were of the main cast talking about their experiences on the show and re-creating scenes from the show, that was so great and hearing the creators talk about how they made and cast the show I found that so interesting to listen to. Unfortunately there was just too much nonsense on the side. See more▼See less▲ Resident Evil Village (2021) Capcom does it again 10 May 2021 - 4 out of 5 users found this review helpful. Another great entry in the Resident Evil series. I loved everything about the game, the story, the villains, the setting everything. I can't wait to see where they take the series next after the after credits sequence. Highly recommend! Also the part in house Beneviento was absolutely terrifying!

I loved this show, I mean I absolutely loved this show but nothing made any sense in this final season at all. Characters acting completely out of character, the night king a character who was built up for a long long time was gone just like that and then the worst thing Bran being named king what were they thinking??? 6 episodes was also way to short, how on earth can you finish a show like this with only 6 episodes, nothing makes any sense. An awful ending to a once amazing show. See more▼See less▲ Halloween (1978) My favourite horror movie 13 April 2021 - 3 out of 4 users found this review helpful. This movie is amazing, everything about it - the music, atmosphere, characters, it's just so good. My only criticism would be that they made far too many sequels, they're not all bad but I think on its own this has a lot more mystery to it.

I love this movie so much, it's my personal favourite I just think it's unbeatable. Clint, Lee, Eli, Sergio and Ennio are just incredible and the final standoff my goodness just amazing. The best film ever made. See more▼See less▲ Gisaengchung (2019) Incredible 2 April 2021 - 2 out of 3 users found this review helpful. I'd read the great reviews but didn't know what to expect going into this and it just completely blew me away, one of the greatest movies I've ever watched. Highly recommend!!
