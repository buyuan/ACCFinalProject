Genre Comedy Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The phrase "And now for something completely different" was taken from a real phrase often used by the BBC during their television and radio broadcasts. Goofs The Air Tube that operates Mr. Tree's mouth can be seen in the profile shot, when light starts glinting off it. Quotes BBC Announcer: We interrupt this program to annoy you and make things generally irritating. Crazy credits Episode 41 Michael Ellis (1974) begins with the opening theme song, followed by a screen that says "THE END," followed by the end credits, and then the show begins. This was to allow the unusual ending of that particular episode which would have been ruined by the closing credits. Alternate versions The VHS and DVD releases by A&E contain the full-length versions of the shows. Several episodes run over 30 minutes, and were previously edited by PBS to fit into a 30 minute time slot.

The "jokes" are silly and pointless, and the sketches never have proper endings. I demand that this programme be removed from telly at once and replaced with programmes that are truly representative of the glories of British humour, such as Keeping Up Appearances and the BBC World News. Sincerely, Col. Arthur von Gambolputty-Dinsdale of Ulm (deceased) (Warning: This letter does not reflect the true feelings of the reviewer, who is a huge fan of Python and thinks that the above-mentioned gripes are the very reason that the show is awesome. The comedy still holds up after over 35 years, though several of the costumes and haircuts do not, and the mixture of zany oddball non sequiters, intellectual references and satires, and ingenious physical comedy makes Python something very special and unique. Viva Python! And remember, !las llamas son mas grande que las ranas!) helpful•66 7 sngbrd39 Feb 17, 2006 FAQ11 What is the translation of the "World's Deadliest Joke"?
