His name is Shai-Hulud. Liet Kynes : Bless the Maker and His water. Bless the coming and going of Him. May His passage cleanse the world. And keep the world for His people. Duke Leto Atreides : Dr. Kynes. You saw it. With your own eyes. It's plain to see. Everything they've left us is in shambles. We've been set up to fail. Liet Kynes : That carryall was just old. The desert isn't kind to equipment. Duke Leto Atreides : You know what will happen, if I don't get spice production back on track. Liet Kynes : I'm not here to take your part. Arrakis has seen men like you come and go. Take good care of your family. The desert's not kind to humans either.
