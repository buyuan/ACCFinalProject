Connections Spun-off from Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010) User reviews72 Review Top review 8/10 Historical Blood-Action Drama. Looking back, the best way forward. Knowing, I was worried about the fate of SPARTACUS. But 'Gods of the Arena' didn't disappoint. We are given further insight into some of our favourite characters with focus on the rise of the Ludas. The quality acting & a story which is delivered at a faster pace enthrals the viewer. It left me wondering - In a room full of villains, is our bad guy just an ambitious man? helpful•6 0 katierobertson-11117 Apr 14, 2019 FAQ4 How long before Blood and Sand does this take place? Should I see this before Spartacus: Blood and Sand, Vengeance or War Of The Damned? Will there be a second season?
