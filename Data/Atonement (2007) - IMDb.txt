Robbie is the son of a family servant toward whom the family has always been kind. They paid for his time at Cambridge and now he plans on going to medical school. After the fountain incident, Briony reads a letter intended for Cecilia and concludes that Robbie is a deviant. When her cousin Lola (Juno Temple) is raped, she tells the Police that it was Robbie she saw committing the deed. —garykmcd world war tworapefalse accusationsexloss of virginity182 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines You can only imagine the truth. Genres Drama Mystery Romance War Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for disturbing war images, language and some sexuality Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia In the DVD commentary, Director Joe Wright reveals a lucky fluke that got caught on camera during the scene just before Robbie Turner (James McAvoy) discovers the school girls' massacre. At the point where he removes his helmet, the weather was cloudy. As he looks up the sky, the sun started shining, and then got cloudy again the moment he put his head down. Goofs On arriving on the beach at Dunkirk, Robbie is told of the sinking of the Lancastria and the loss of 3000 men. This event actually occurred 17 days later on June 17 1940. Quotes Cecilia Tallis: I love you. I'll wait for you. Come back. Come back to me. Crazy credits The title types itself out like on a typewriter. Connections Featured in Friday Night with Jonathan Ross: Episode #13.1 (2007) Soundtracks Clair de Lune Written by Claude Debussy Performed by Gordon Thompson Courtesy of Sanctuary Records Group Ltd User reviews700 Review Top review 10/10 Amazing!!! Favourite Romantic Movie. I was completely stunned when I watched Atonement yesterday. From the funny lines to the sad moments, this movie does not fail to amaze me. James McAvoy is by far the shining star in this movie, endowed with unfailing charisma and absolutely adoring accent. The score was impeccable, especially the sound of the typewriter. I loved the scenes from Dunkirk, the hospital, and ,of course, the mansion. It's truly an amazing movie that I consider to be the best of 2007's. The ending was rather sad, but it fits perfectly. Keira Knightley was ineffably wonderful with her charming beauty and brilliant performance. One should really go and watch it because it's a fulfilling experience. I personally give it 10/10. helpful•114 45 mysterious_boy_92 Feb 7, 2008 FAQ8 What happens at the end? Was Robbie guilty of the rape of Lola? What music plays in the trailer?
