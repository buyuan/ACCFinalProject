Its subject is the school. The educational system, like an industrial machine. The film reminds the importance of the student. Out of his behavior, loneliness, violent reactions, verdict of teachers. In same measure, it is a film about near reality. With each detail defining it. A film about a family tragedy. Touching, off course, terrible in profound sense. And far to be extraordinary because it is slice of each contemporary war. The film propose, in fact, a question - who is the other ? What roots are behind his attitude ? Maybe, the answers are not significant. Only the questions. And the good performances. helpful•1 1 Kirpianuscus Jul 12, 2019 Details Edit Release date 2015 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Official site Official site Language English Production company Vituhmin Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 19 minutes Color Color Related news Simon Pegg, Mike Myers cast in neo-noir thriller Terminal May 24Den of Geek Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
