Genres Animation Crime Drama Fantasy Mystery Thriller Certificate (Banned) Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Light Yagami and L are often represented as opposites, even to the point that Light uses a PC and L uses an Apple Macintosh. Quotes Ryuk: You have lost, Light. Didn't I say in the beginning, when you die, the one who'll write your name down in a notebook will be me. That is the deal between the Shinigami and the first human to get their hands on the note in the human world. Once you enter prison, I don't know when you'll die. It's annoying to wait. Your life is already over. You'll die here. [pause] Ryuk: Well, it was good while it lasted. We killed some boredom, didn't we? We did some various and interesting things.

This show just keeps getting better and better! Every episode has a new twist, and is never the same as the last! It will keep you on the edge of your seat, and you will watch it again and again! The story is centered around a young man, Yagami Raito/Light who finds a "Death Note". I won't tell you anymore about this "Death Note" (as that would spoil it). With this "Death Note" he sets about ridding the world of evil and creating a "Utopia", with himself as the new god. Filled with interesting characters, lots of intelligent dialouge and exiting plot twists, this show is definitely on my top 10! I would Highly recommend it to anyone, those who enjoy crime/psychological/dark themes. helpful•175 36 x-SaiLor-SeNshi-x Jan 29, 2007 Details Edit Release date October 3, 2006 (Japan) Country of origin Japan Official sites Madhouse (Japan) NTV (Japan) Language Japanese Also known as Death Note Production companies D.N.
