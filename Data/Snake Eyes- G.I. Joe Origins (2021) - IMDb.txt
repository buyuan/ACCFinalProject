His epic origin story. Genres Action Adventure Fantasy Sci-Fi Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for sequences of strong violence and brief strong language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The movie is a reboot of the G.I. Joe property on film, and intended to be part of a shared universe of features based on Hasbro properties with G.I. Joe: Ever Vigilant, Visionaries: Knights of the Magical Light, M.A.S.K.: Mobile Armored Strike Kommand, ROM: Spaceknight and Micronauts. Goofs Henry Golding's American accent keeps slipping throughout the movie. This is because the actor, Henry Golding, is of English and Malaysian descent. He therefore speaks English with a British accent, but his character, Snake Eyes, is Asian American. Quotes Baroness: [deciding to run away from the battle] Oh, fuck this! Crazy credits There is a scene in the closing credits: Storm Shadow and Baroness meet, and she offers him a place in Cobra.

(2021) Soundtracks Tokyo Mayhem Written & Performed by Martin Todsharow Additional Electronica Programming by Henrik Müller & Tassilo Ippenberger User reviews591 Review Top review 4/10 More of what is becoming the norm. Great visuals ruined by terrible writing. Hollywood is a big place, where are all the good writers at? And why do people keep agreeing to go along with a film after reading a terrible screenplay? People need to start speaking up before the film is complete about the writing. helpful•56 10 mcaleb1486 Aug 5, 2021 Details Edit Release date November 5, 2021 (China) Country of origin United States Official sites Official site Official Site (Japan) Language English Also known as 特种部队：蛇眼起源 Filming locations Japan Production companies Paramount Pictures Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) Skydance Media See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $88,000,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $28,264,325 Opening weekend US & Canada $13,367,853 Jul 25, 2021 Gross worldwide $40,064,325 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 2 hours 1 minute Color Color Sound mix Dolby Surround 7.1 IMAX 6-Track Dolby Digital Dolby Atmos Aspect ratio 2.39 : 1 Related news ‘Eternals’ Is Weekend King(o) With $91M Overseas & $162M Global Bows – International Box Office Nov 7Deadline Film + TV ViacomCBS Reports Q3 Streaming Growth But Subdued Overall Results; CEO Bob Bakish Says Release Windows Will Continue To Vary, Ad Revenue Hit By Supply Chain Issues – Update Nov 4Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What was the official certification given to Snake Eyes: G.I.
