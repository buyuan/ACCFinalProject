All the women. Half the intelligence. Genres Action Comedy Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for crude humor and sexual innuendo Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The opening title sequence is a very specific and direct send-up of the main title sequence of the James Bond movie Thunderball (1965). Goofs Ford Motor Company didn't make the Pinto in 1969. They only made them between 1971 and 1980. Quotes Dick Steele, Agent WD-40: You carry a UB-21 Schnauzer with a Gnab silencer. That's KGB. You prefer an H&K over an A.K. Your surveillance technique is NSA. Your ID is CIA. You received your Ph.D. at NYU. Traded in your GTO for a BMW. You listen to CDs by R.E.M. and STP. And you'd like to see J.F.K. in his BVDs, getting down with O.P.P. And you probably put the toilet paper back on the roll with the paper on the inside. Crazy credits Ms. Sheridan's Stand-Out: Her Legs Connections Edited into 'Weird Al' Yankovic: The Videos (1996) Soundtracks Spy Hard Theme Written, Produced and Performed by 'Weird Al' Yankovic Arranged and Orchestrated by Steve Jay (as Stephen Jay) Orchestra Conducted by Jimmie Haskell Courtesy of Scotti Bros. Records User reviews97 Review Top review 5/10 Leslie Nielsen continuing the formula , this time like a crazed international Agent Leislie Nielsen again , he plays a super Agent , Dick Steele , finding in retirement , he's called for a new mission . He'll fight against General Raucov (Andy Griffith) for world control and being only helped by a beautiful spy (Nicolette Sheridan) . The picture is the usual ¨spoof¨ or parody featured by Nielsen with similar lunatic characters , quirky roles and strange elements of the predecessors ; thus , it is surrealist , hilarious , extreme and sometimes gross-out . There're gags each fifty seconds . The film is formed by innumerable comical set-pieces and a myriad of unimaginative parodies where the wacky humor and laughs are continuous . The pioneers of these kinds of comedies are the popular trio ZAZ (Jim Abrahams , Jerry Zucker , David Zucker) but here the formula is a little worn-out . The amusement and fun result to be for finding out the numerous cinematic references that successively appear , such as : the credits title of ¨James Bond¨ movie , ¨In the line of fire¨ (Nielsen playing Clint Eastwood lookalike), ¨Pulp Fiction¨ (like Travolta), ¨Sister Act¨(performing a nun , Woopy Goldberg alike), ¨Speed¨ , ¨True Lies¨, ¨Die Hard¨, ¨Home Alone¨ , ¨Dennis the Menace¨ (where acts the same kid , Mason Gamble) and ¨Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid¨ in which acting Paul Newman-alike and riding his bicycle , he plays a bewildering scene under Burt Bacharach music with smile to roar with laughter . Besides , there are several cameos and special interventions as Pat Morita (recently deceased ), Mr.T (as A-Team member) , Alexandra Paul (Baywatch) , Hulk Hogan , Robert Culp , Fabio.. The motion picture will appeal to absurd and unruly comedy enthusiastic. helpful•9 4 ma-cortes Jan 4, 2006 Details Edit Release date May 24, 1996 (United States) Country of origin United States Languages English French Spanish Also known as Live and Let Spy Filming locations Los Angeles County Arboretum & Botanic Garden - 301 N.
