It is then discovered that his son is safe at home: the kidnapper took his chauffeur's son by accident. The kidnapper says this makes no difference: pay up or the child dies. This leaves him with a moral dilemma, as he really needs the money to conclude a very important business deal. —grantss house on a hilldetectiveransomchauffeurjapanese law enforcement110 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines 142 Screenful Minutes of Thrills and Suspense! Genres Crime Drama Mystery Thriller Certificate Not Rated Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia After the film was released, kidnappings were on the rise in Japan. Akira Kurosawa himself had received threats for the kidnapping of his own daughter, Kazuko Kurosawa. She quoted him as once saying to her "With High and Low, I wanted to inspire tougher sentences on kidnappers. Instead, I was criticized for their increase." Goofs The story occurs in midsummer. This implies that Mt. Fuji has no snow. Since the location filming was carried out in winter season, the top of Mt. Fuji is very white. Some film critics mention that this is almost the only mistake they can find in the film. Quotes Kingo Gondo: Why should you and I hate each other? Ginjirô Takeuchi, medical intern: I don't know. I'm not interested in self-analysis. I do know my room was so cold in winter and so hot in summer I couldn't sleep. Your house looked like heaven, high up there. That's how I began to hate you.

Kurosawa Akira: Korega Kuroswa sasupensu da (2003) Soundtracks The Magic Begins (uncredited) Performed by Yumi Shirakawa User reviews145 Review Top review Great suspenceful crime story. Fine performances early in the careers of future stars. A child of a chauffeur is mistakenly kidnapped in the place of a businessman's son. The businessman, involved in a high-stakes takeover of his company from his erring bosses, chooses to risk losing his shirt to pay the ransom for a child not his own. While the clock is ticking on both the businessman's fortune and the child's life, the police decide that they want a sure conviction rather than a quick arrest. A suspenseful crime story based on a novel by Evan Hunter (aka Ed McBain) transported to 1960's Japan. The soon to be famous "Economic miracle" is in full swing as Japan rebuilds its war-ravaged landscape. The mix of optimism and despair of the people in the thick of this economic transformation is palpable beneath the multiple story lines of scrappy cops following their hunches, the inventive kidnapper and the businessman. Toshiro Mifune shines as the businessman while Tatuya Nakadai makes a fine appearance as Inspector Tokura. Tsutomu Yamazaki as the kidnapper debuts into a glorious career. Many of the bit players who appear only briefly eventually became big stars notably Eijiro Tono as the worker in a shoe factory and Nekohachi Edoya as the charming engineer who identifies a train, gesturing with chopsticks, by merely listening to recorded sounds. helpful•14 7 fuyuno Feb 19, 1999 Details Edit Release date March 1, 1963 (Japan) Country of origin Japan Language Japanese Also known as 天国与地狱 Filming locations Toho Studios, Tokyo, Japan Production companies Kurosawa Production Co.
