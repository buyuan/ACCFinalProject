Connections Featured in WatchMojo: Top 10 Horror Movies of 2020 So Far (2020) Soundtracks Nearer My God to Thee Written by Sarah F. Adams (as Sarah Flower Adams) Composed by Eliza Flower User reviews667 Review Top review 8/10 So glad this is not another mindless teen horror flick! This film was pretty amazing cautionary tale of messing with the wrong person. I can't believe so many bad reviews? I find that younger viewers don't enjoy horror films that make you feel dread or build dark sense of mood. To do that In a film takes time to get to know characters and developing a story. It's definitely not for anyone with a short attention span that needs a jump scare every 5 mins to keep your attention. I feel films like The Lodge and Midsommar are the new school of horror films that keep you thinking long after the credits roll. It's a style that's definitely not for everyone. In a way these horror films are all grown up and not like anything else out there. It's about time horror went in a new direction. helpful•25 10 chiquidracula-264-204027 Jul 8, 2020 FAQ16 why after Laura's funeral her daughter Mia sobbingly says "she can't go to heaven"? why Grace gets frequent nosebleeds? what is condition which Grace takes the pills for?
