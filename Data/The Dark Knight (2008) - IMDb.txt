Batman's struggle against The Joker becomes deeply personal, forcing him to "confront everything he believes" and improve his technology to stop him. A love triangle develops between Bruce Wayne, Dent, and Rachel Dawes. —Leon Lombardi dc comicsmoral dilemmapsychopathclownsuperhero785 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Why So Serious? Genres Action Crime Drama Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and some menace Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia In Sir Michael Caine's opinion, Heath Ledger beat the odds and topped Jack Nicholson's Joker from Batman (1989): "Jack was like a clown figure, benign but wicked, maybe a killer old uncle. He could be funny and make you laugh. Heath's gone in a completely different direction to Jack, he's like a really scary psychopath. He's a lovely guy and his Joker is going to be a hell of a revelation in this picture." Caine bases this belief on a scene where The Joker pays a visit to Bruce Wayne's penthouse. He'd never met Ledger before, so when Ledger arrived and performed, he gave Caine such a fright, he forgot his lines. Goofs It is said that all of the license plates seen on cars in the film are Illinois plates. In fact, they're not: they are actually plates for the fictional Gotham, although they resemble Illinois plates. The "Gotham" plates that were created by film makers were made to look like Illinois plates, just in case some slipped through in background shots during filming in Chicago. Quotes The Chechen: [During a private sit down meeting with the gangsters] What do you propose? The Joker: It's simple. We, uh, kill the Batman. [mobsters laugh] Salvatore Maroni: If it's so simple, why haven't you done it already? The Joker: If you're good at something, never do it for free. Crazy credits Large blue flames dissipate in the center to form the new Batman symbol. The film title does not appear until the the closing credits. Alternate versions The Blu-ray version of the movie has several of the big action scenes and high altitude photography scenes in ordinary 16:9 (1.78:1) widescreen ratio while the rest of the movie preserves the "scope" format (2.39:1). This is because these scenes were filmed in IMAX, whose format is 1.43:1, thus attempting to recreate the effect witnessed in IMAX theaters, as well as preserving as much of these shots as possible.

Everything was great, filming, acting, story. Nothing to complain about helpful•143 13 elmerivikki Jan 9, 2021 FAQ78 Who created the character of Batman? Bob Kane is listed in old (pre-2015) media including the comic books as creating Batman on his own but new media (made after 2015) shows him as co-creating the character with someone called Bill Finger, so what's all that about? Which characters were adapted from the Batman comic books? Is there any archive footage in the film?
