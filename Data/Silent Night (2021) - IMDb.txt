User reviews1 Review Top review 9/10 Closing Night - at Fantasy Filmfest This was the final film that played at the Fantasy Filmfest in Germany (and will be playing in a few more cities after Berlin and Stuttgart to be more precise, in the next couple of weeks) - and what a film it is. It reminded me of some really good slow paced and creepy horror movies I have seen - and a bit of Stephen King (in more than one way). We got a foreword by the director and she sort of said ... well revealed something major - a twist that is. I will not do that, even though apparently the movie has been misused to spread a certain kind of message. To that I can only say: do not read too much into certain things! This is a horror movie and while it does have something to say overall, this is not (covid) pandemic related. Great actors and if you are like me and do not read anything about this ... quite a few surprises coming your way ... with a lot of Christmas songs to counter the mood - but no Last Christmas or Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer ... in case you were wondering. helpful•30 2 kosmasp Oct 24, 2021 Details Edit Release date December 3, 2021 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Official site Official site Language English Also known as Cha Cha Dance Production companies Maven Screen Media Marv Films See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 32 minutes Color Color Related news Keira Knightley Bans Shooting Sex Scenes for Male Directors, Cites Male Gaze as the Issue Jan 25Indiewire Keira Knightley Reveals Discomfort of Male Gaze: ‘I’d Just Rather Not Stand in Front of a Group of Men Naked’ Jan 25Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Silent Night (2021) officially released in Japan in Japanese?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
