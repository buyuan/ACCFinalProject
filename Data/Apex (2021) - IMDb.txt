User reviews59 Review Top review 1/10 Dull and Underwhelming Is An Understatement... This is Truly the Apex of Bruce Willis' Demise. This Movie is utterly embarrassing for all involved, not even worth a Review, So Painfully Amateurish, even Neal McDonough, a solid actor seems lost in this Messy Showbiz Project. Absolutely Awful. helpful•8 1 spipeschi Nov 14, 2021 Details Edit Release date November 12, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Also known as Apex Predator Filming locations Victoria, British Columbia, Canada Production companies 308 Ent BondIt Media Capital Buffalo 8 Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 34 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 2.39:1 Related news ‘No Time to Die’ Sweeps VOD Charts as Netflix Originals Dominate the Streamer’s Top 10 Nov 15Indiewire Review: "The Last Man On Earth" (1963) Starring Vincent Price; Kino Lorber Blu-ray Special Edition Oct 29Cinemaretro.com Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Spanish language plot outline for Apex (2021)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
