Its name means "Sword Neighborhood" in Turkish. It consisted of illegally built small houses and most of its inhabitants were very poor. It was completely demolished in the 1960s to make space for a highway, colleges and other new buildings. Goofs Season two starts on 31st December 1933 and several characters use Zippo lighters, though Zippo was first made in 1936, and the design used in the series was introduced post WWII. User reviews57 Review Top review 10/10 Possibly the best TV Show produced in Serbia ever Dragan Bjelogrlic did remarkable thing! Almost all characters really lived in those times and had huge influence on historical course of Yugoslavia and Europe as well. From watching the show you can really see that He had put Serbian production on totaly another level.
