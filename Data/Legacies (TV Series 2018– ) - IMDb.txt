Connections Featured in MsMojo: Top 10 BEST TV Couples of 2019 (2019) User reviews488 Review Top review 8/10 Really not that bad Honestly it's not that bad. I've seen far worse. For those who are annoyed about it 'expanding the universe' it's really no different to what Fantastic Beasts has done for Harry Potter. I find it watchable enough and will continue to give it a go. Don't let other reviews make up your mind for you. Give it a go and see what you think. helpful•31 15 rroelandskeim Dec 14, 2018 Details Edit Release date December 21, 2019 (China) Country of origin United States Official sites Official Facebook Official Instagram Language English Also known as 后裔 Filming locations Atlanta, Georgia, USA Production companies My So-Called Company Alloy Entertainment CBS Television Studios See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 45 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news Legacies Spoilers: Will Hope Destroy the Super Squad?
