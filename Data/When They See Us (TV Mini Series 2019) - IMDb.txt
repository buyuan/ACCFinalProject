The quintet, labeled the Central Park Five, maintained its innocence and spent years fighting the convictions, hoping to be exonerated. This limited series spans a quarter of a century, from when the teens are first questioned about the incident in the spring of 1989, going through their exoneration in 2002 and ultimately the settlement reached with the city of New York in 2014. The cast is full of Emmy nominees and winners, including Michael Kenneth Williams, John Leguizamo, Felicity Huffman, and Blair Underwood. Oscar nominated and Emmy winner Ava DuVernay co-wrote and directed the four episodes. —Jwelch5742 new york citycentral parkrape accusation1980stv mini series62 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines What if all boys were created equal? Genres Biography Crime Drama History Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Jharrel Jerome lobbied for an audition while he was busy filming Mr. Mercedes (2017), for which he had grown a beard. With the beard, he was afraid he would be considered too old to play the younger Korey, and he fully expected that the project would cast two different actors to play the part at different ages. After finishing Mr. Mercedes, he shaved his beard and auditioned again. Ava DuVernay was so impressed by both his audition, and how much his facial hair aged him, that she cast him as Korey at both ages.
