A dream of freedom Genres Comedy Drama Parents guide Add content advisory User reviews2 Review Top review A horror subject made light First, it is not a Comedy. Not at all. Not because of the subject, not because of the acting. It's clear that the country in the movie is Chile (even the flag is similar) during the years of Pinochet dictatorship and murders. The movie tries to make look the killers not so bad and the prisoners in better conditions they really were at the time. No tortures, no abuses, no women prisoners. Their relationship seems too friendly to be real. On the subject, the movie "Missing" shows a different view, but at least, more real. If you want to know more about that period in our history, search for the The Rettig Report, which states the thousands of disappearing and atrocities that took place those days. Anyway, the movie is not too bad, maybe a little slow. Probably the fact that is both English and Spanish spoken, stopped it from more exposure. Keitel is not brilliant, far as usual, but it's remarkable that he wanted to participate in this project. (probably a very low budget movie). Too much emphasis on the potato cooking... while in the reality, those guys were probably more worried about being killed in cold blood than potato recipes. Good caricature of the "general", that one made me smile. But that doesn't make it qualify for a comedy. helpful•6 3 cyberxime Aug 23, 2004 Details Edit Release date March 1, 2002 (Italy) Countries of origin Italy Spain Argentina Official site Official site Movie info, cast info, trailer, pictures.
