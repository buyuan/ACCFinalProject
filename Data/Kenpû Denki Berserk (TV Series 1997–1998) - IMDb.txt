After killing his guardian in self-defence, he runs away. Years later, he encounters Griffith and The Band of the Hawk. The Hawks fight for the King of Midland, and after winning the 100-year war against the neighbouring empire, they become the King's personal guard. However, once they reach the top, things take a turn for the worse. —Devin Hill-Mann <groovinhipster@hotmail.com> dark fantasyanimesword fightingcrueltydemon311 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Is the destiny of mankind controlled by some transcendental entity or Law? Is it like the hand of God hovering above? At least it is true, that man has no control, even over his own will Genres Animation Action Adventure Drama Fantasy Horror Romance Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The manga that the anime is based on had a big influence on the Dark Souls (2011) video game series. Quotes Griffith: It is my perception that a true friend never relies on anothers dream. A person with the potential to be my true friend must be able to find his own reason for life without my help. And he should put his heart and soul into protecting his dream. He would never hesitate to fight for his dream, even against me. For me, a true friend is one who stands equal to me in all respects. Crazy credits After the final episode's credits, Gatsu is shown leaving Godo's home with his new Dragon Slayer blade, and receiving a warning from Godo 'not to get killed'. Connections Featured in AMV Hell (2004) Soundtracks Forces by Susumu Hirasawa User reviews117 Review Top review Very crude, but very watchable The plot of Berserk is purely the stuff of pulp fiction novel series: a young man with a talent for killing falls in with a group of super-mercenaries, and with them, grows into the most lethal warrior of his time. However, it's done as well as it can be here. At first, Berserk seems crude beyond belief. It's certainly not brilliantly scripted, and the animation isn't top quality, but it grows on you remarkably fast. The European medieval setting makes the intensely bloody action and philosophical musings seem more natural, and character of Guts is solid enough to give some substance to the series as a whole. He's pure killing power, untempered by reflection or remorse. But as the series goes on, he learns some responsibility and compassion. It doesn't happen in some sudden epiphany, but gradually. Also, a lot of his history is revealed in flashbacks. We learn the unflinching truth of how he became so unfeeling. So overall, Berserk is definitely worth seeing. It's character driven in spite of its intense violence, and it has some genuine emotions in spite of its hardcore narrative cruelty. helpful•53 18 kingtanichi Mar 22, 2004 FAQ10 What's Berserk about?
