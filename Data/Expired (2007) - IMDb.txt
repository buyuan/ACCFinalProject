And the heroine of EXPIRED, the parking officer Claire, knows it. The film revolves around Claire, a kind soul who resents having to enforce the law at all times, and Jay, an angry traffic officer who loves his job, being the perfect outlet for his anger and frustrations. Coming both from a place of despair and loneliness, Jay and Claire meet and engage in a tumultuous relationship which will eventually teach them that love can spread his magic seeds of redemption and hope, even in the darkest and most perverted of all affairs. And don't forget to put money in the meter. —Anonymous jobf ratednew year's evecharacter says i love youanswering machine message35 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Don't park your heart in the red zone.

I saw Expired. It's a fine film. Writer and director, Cecilia Miniucchi, did a superb job, the acting was great. What strikes me, though, is the film's uncanny resemblance to Federico Fellini's La Strada (The Road) starring Anthony Quinn, Giulietta Masina (Fellini's wife), Richard Basehart. Miniucchi said that she purposely cast Samantha Morton as the lead. I think she did so because Morton resembles Giulietta Masina. She has the same big sad eyes and innocent face. Jason Patric is the rugged emotionally crude Anthony Quinn. In La Strada, Quinn buys Mesina from her family and takes her away in his THREE WHEEL Motorcyle caravan to help him with his little strong man road show. Mesina must beat a drum and proclaim, "Zampano is here," in each small town. In Expired, Jason Patric, takes Claire on the road (to Pomona) in a THREE WHEEL traffic cop's vehicle. There are a number of similar scenes throughout Expired. But in the end, Patric, like Quinn, is too crude to earn Morton's love. In La Strada, Quinn abandons Mesina, only to discover her spirit in a seaside town. The confrontation undoes him and the end of the film shows him weeping on his knees next to the sea. helpful•5 6 sn-4 Oct 7, 2008 Details Edit Release date August 15, 2008 (Sweden) Country of origin United States Official site Official site Language English Also known as Срок истек Filming locations Pomona, California, USA Production companies Aga Films FR Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross US & Canada $29,796 Opening weekend US & Canada $6,596 Jun 22, 2008 Gross worldwide $65,003 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 47 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 Related news Jason Patric to Star in Wayward Pines Season 2 Feb 5DailyDead 2012 Sundance Predictions: Alonso Filomeno Mayo's The Story of Luke Nov 13IONCINEMA.com Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Spanish language plot outline for Expired (2007)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
