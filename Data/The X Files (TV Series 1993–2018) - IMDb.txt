Mulder, a true believer, and Scully, a skeptic, perceive their cases from stand points of science and the paranormal. —ZachMichalik fbi agentalien conspiracyparanormal phenomenonparanormal activityparanormal investigator42 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Apology Is Policy Genres Crime Drama Mystery Sci-Fi Thriller Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The famous echoing chord from the theme music was a fluke. Composer Mark Snow accidentally rested his elbow on his keyboard with the echo function on and he liked the resulting sound so much, he wrote the theme around it. Goofs Throughout the series, in closeups of The Smoker's ashtray while he is extinguishing his cigarette, the filters of the "smoked" cigarettes already in the ashtrays are perfectly white, while they should be yellow/brown from the nicotine-smoke. This indicates that they are props, placed there before shooting and not cigarettes smoked by the characters. Quotes Scully: You have seen this before, I can tell. You lied to them. Mulder: I would never lie. I willfully participated in a campaign of misinformation. Crazy credits This production has not been approved, endorsed or authorized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. (appears in the end credits) Alternate versions The 'previously on The X Files' segments are missing from the DVD Season boxset releases. Connections Edited into The X-Files: Re-Opened (2015) User reviews446 Review Top review Really one of the coolest shows around The X-Files is one of the best shows ever. The show has great episodes dealing with something paranormal and/or conspiracy. The characters have a great chemistry, especially Mulder and Scully. It's not as good as it was a few years back, but it's still way above most shows on today. Many episodes have dealt with this alien conspiracy recently, but the neat thing about it is how not everything is explained, leaving the door open for further episodes. The X-Files is a very excellent show. helpful•106 21 Op_Prime Jun 8, 2000 FAQ31 Where do the movies fit in the series? Do I need to watch the original X-Files series before the revival/Season 10? What references does The X-Files revival make to the original series?
