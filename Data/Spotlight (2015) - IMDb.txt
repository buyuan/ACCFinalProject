Genres Biography Crime Drama Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for some language including sexual references Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia In the baseball game scene, the real Michael Rezendes, Sacha Pfeiffer, and Walter Robinson can be seen in the background. Goofs In the middle of the movie Sacha Pfeiffer knocks on a door to interview a Ronald Paquin. She knocks on the glass in the door, but it makes the sound of someone knocking on solid wood. Quotes Marty Baron: Sometimes it's easy to forget that we spend most of our time stumbling around the dark. Suddenly, a light gets turned on and there's a fair share of blame to go around. I can't speak to what happened before I arrived, but all of you have done some very good reporting here. Reporting that I believe is going to have an immediate and considerable impact on our readers. For me, this kind of story is why we do this. Connections Featured in The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon: Michael Keaton/Nick Offerman/Chris Janson (2015) Soundtracks West Side Waltz Written by Dick Walter Courtesy of APM Music User reviews671 Review Top review 8/10 Spotlight The whole movie is like a good news report itself. It tells the story, introduces people, looks for evidence and solves difficulties. Calm and clear, it is said that it is also very appropriate for the real office and living environment of journalists. Of course, in order to maintain this tone, the story of the news itself has been weakened, and the character of the reporter itself can not be deeply shaped. helpful•4 0 m-91886 Jun 22, 2020 FAQ4 What is "Cardinal Law"? Is it like the Ten Commandments? Is it normal for me to be unfamiliar with it because I am not Catholic? What has been the Catholic media response to "Spotlight"? How does "Spotlight" pay tribute to longform journalism?
