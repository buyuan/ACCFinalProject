The focus is mainly Connell's and Marianne's complex relationship. Among her peers at secondary school Marianne is regarded as an oddball, though she rejects having any care for social standing. Despite her academic achievements, her home life is complicated by her dismissive mother, Denise, and resentful brother, Alan. Her father is deceased and is revealed to have been a domestic abuser, though her family avoids mentioning him. Connell is a high-achieving athletic student living with his single mother Lorraine, who is employed by Denise as a cleaner. He is popular in the school community, though he is diminished by remaining silent during the bullying of Marianne. This creates complexity as their relationship develops. —Wiki irelanduniversitybased on novelstar crossed loverscoming of age8 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Drama Romance Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia After filming wrapped, Paul Mescal gave his character's signature chain necklace as a gift to Daisy Edgar-Jones. Connections Featured in Jeremy Vine: Episode #3.87 (2020) User reviews633 Review Top review 10/10 Heartache-ingly brilliant! Beautifully written characters and amazing acting. I LOVED this! I hadn't read the book this was adapted from but now want to and couldn't imagine anyone else being Marianne & Connell. Daisy Edgar-Jones' beautiful doe eyes and Paul Mescal's soulful gaze. I was mesmerised by the chemistry between these two. Very few love stories make my heart actually ache! I cried my way through 6 hours of this brilliance! helpful•236 50 fayandlola Apr 26, 2020 Details Edit Release date April 26, 2020 (United Kingdom) Countries of origin Ireland United Kingdom United States Official site Hulu Language English Also known as Нормальні люди Filming locations Sligo, Ireland Production companies Element Pictures British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) Hulu Originals See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 5 hours 39 minutes Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 1.78 : 1 Related news ‘Mothering Sunday’ Trailer: Odessa Young and Josh O’Connor Find Romance Painful in Interwar Britain Nov 13Indiewire Paul Mescal and Phoebe Bridgers Seem to Confirm Romance With Cute Red Carpet Moment Nov 7E!
