Aegis Oil's corrupt C.E.O., Michael Jennings (Sir Michael Caine), is the kind of person who doesn't care whether or not oil spills into the ocean or onto the land, just as long as it's making money for him. He even makes commercials that make him look like he cares about the environment. Jennings is almost finished with building his new state-of-the art oil rig: AEGIS-1. The problem is that if he doesn't finish building the rig in thirteen days, the land rights will be returned to the Eskimos and the Alaskan Government. When Jennings finds out that Taft's best friend Hugh Palmer (Richard Hamilton) has a computer disk that contains information about defective equipment on AEGIS-1, he sends out his goons to murder Palmer. When Taft tries to interfere, Jennings tries to kill Taft. But an Eskimo woman named Masu (Joan Chen), who introduces Taft to her father Silook (Chief Irvin Brink), the Chief of her tribe, rescues Taft. With Masu's help, Taft begins a trek through the Alaskan wilderness, heading straight for AEGIS-1 and to destroy it before it destroys all of the forest. —drayj65 <drayj65@hotmail.com> oilenvironmentalmurdertribeoil spill185 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines His Battle To Save The Alaskan Wilderness And Protect Its People Can Only Be Won... Genres Action Adventure Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for strong violence and language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Producer and director Steven Seagal filmed almost 40 minutes of footage for the environmental message at the end of this movie, and planned to use it all in the final cut. After pressure from Warner Brothers and a disastrous preview screening, where audience members booed, laughed, and made obscene gestures for the entire sequence, Seagal cut the final scene down to about seven minutes. Goofs After Taft runs MacGruder into the helicopter's tail rotor, Liles drives by and sees the body, which doesn't appear to have suffered a grave head injury. MacGruder is lying on his stomach with his hands over his head and no blood visible. Quotes Michael Jennings: [seeing all his workers fleeing for their lives] You're a bunch of GUTLESS PRICKS! ALL OF YOU! Michael Jennings: [seeing a worker close to him running away] You! Come help me! Oil worker: FUCK YOU! Michael Jennings: You yellow BASTARD! Crazy credits The first half of the end credits run over images of Alaska and its various wildlife, until we see Forrest Taft & Masu in a canoe, with Taft pointing out to Masu, a crow in front of them circling over the water (supposedly meant to be Silook in another form) Alternate versions German TV and Retail-Video/DVD Versions are cut to reduce violence. The uncut Version is available on Rental-Video and DVD. Connections Edited from Out for Justice (1991) User reviews160 Review Top review Rub noses with me, "Eskimo" maiden In this Alaskan film, Joan Chen plays what is quite probably the last word in Sino-Eskimo snow bunnies. Eskimo Joan represents the same sort of Hollywood confusion about racial boundary lines which saw Larry Fishburne play the Moor of Venice, and Jackie Chan cast to play the King of Pop in an upcoming TV movie. (I'm kidding about one of these.) Not to mention generations of Italian and Jewish Indians, and more white actors in blackface than there are seeds in a watermelon. Joan is teamed here with Steven Seagal, quite probably the last word in inarticulate and extremely violent tree-hugging Buddhists. Sort of the Billy Jack of the Barents Sea. His jacket has more fringe on it than you'd see at a reunion concert by the Buffalo Springfield. Together, they try to build a world where an interracial couple can be happy in an oomiak built for two. A number of years ago, I spent nearly 8 seconds at a book-signing in the presence of Michael Caine. For each of those seconds, he was extremely personable. So it's a bit of a revelation for me seeing him playing his two-faced vicious Hun of a smooth oil company CEO. Old favourite John C. McGinley also appears against type as one of Caine's nastier henchthugs. Finally, there's Seagal's direction which takes his film on this ecological walk through the woods which makes it all seem a little like Oliver Stone after too many days trapped in a sweatlodge. It's so ridiculous I actually found myself enjoying the whole thing quite a bit. helpful•16 17 Varlaam Feb 24, 2001 FAQ1 What are the differences between the British BBFC 15 Verion and the Uncensored Version?
