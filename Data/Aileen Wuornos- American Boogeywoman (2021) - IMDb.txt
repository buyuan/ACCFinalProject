Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Drama Horror Thriller Certificate R Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia When the project was announced, star Peyton List explained in a statement why she was excited about taking on this role, "We know so little of the early years of Aileen, especially given she was living a very different life to the one we see in Monster (2003). Embodying such a deeply complex and divisive character is what drew me to the project, and I can't wait to bring context to America's most infamous female serial killer." Connections References Psycho (1960) User reviews13 Review Top review 1/10 The "daytime soap opera" version of the story. For anyone even vaguely interested in the real story - or even interested in real writing and acting - do yourself a favour and watch Monster (2003). In the 2003 movie, the producers/writers/director went to great lengths to make sure the movie was guided by real facts, and picked a cast capable of delivering performances so strong that at times it seemed more like a documentary. American Boogeywoman by contrast delivers little more than you'd expect to find in gossip magazines, with production/writing/acting more at home in "Days of Our Lives" than in a movie. Seriously, give this one a miss. helpful•9 5 Angry_Santa Oct 10, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 7, 2021 (United Arab Emirates) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Монстр: Начало Filming locations Los Angeles, California, USA Production companies 1428 Films Green Light Pictures Redwire Pictures See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross worldwide $5,612 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 25 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Peyton List is a Monster in the making in Aileen Wuornos: American Boogeywoman trailer Aug 29Flickeringmyth Voltage Pictures takes world rights on Ted Bundy thriller ‘American Boogeyman’ (exclusive) Apr 27ScreenDaily Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the English language plot outline for Aileen Wuornos: American Boogeywoman (2021)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
