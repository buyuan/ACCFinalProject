In the resulting chaos as the wounded are cared for, Saunders and his comrades join forces with the FBI to get to the bottom of this attack. As the investigation continues, the Tsarnaev brothers realize that the authorities are close to identifying them and attempt to flee the city to continue their fanatical mayhem. To stop them, a police manhunt is performed that would have bloody confrontations and a massive dragnet shutting down the City of Boston to make sure there is no escape from the law. —Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) policeterroristbased on true storymanhuntboston marathon270 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines The inside story of the world's greatest manhunt. Genres Action Crime Drama History Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for violence, realistically graphic injury images, language throughout and some drug use Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The Military Police in the movie are real-life MPs from the Massachusetts National Guard. Some of them had responded in the week following the attack. Goofs When Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is pulled out of the boat, he is thrown on the ground. The shot from above sees him falling on straw/grass bedding, but the shot from the side show only dirt. Quotes Dun Meng: Go catch those motherfuckers! Alternate versions In the German version, the supplement at the end of the movie (where interviews with real life people are shown) was removed because it was deemed too patriotic/pathetic for Non-American viewers. Connections Featured in The Late Show with Stephen Colbert: John Goodman/Denee Benton/Norah Jones (2016) Soundtracks Country Fried Written by Zac Brown and Wyatt Durrette User reviews288 Review Top review 7/10 Good Film but Lacks Depth There seem to be a lot of negative reviews for this movie because of an apparent mis-telling of the story or true story or hoax or whatever else people have said. As I'm not American, and have very little to do with American events (so hence have no context as to the truth or hoax or conspiracy or whatever of the Boston Marathon) I shall just stick to reviewing the movie for what it is: a movie. As a movie, they did a great job pulling it together. Mark Wahlberg plays his character perfectly. I have no idea if thats because of his acting ability, or if its more the fact that someone has yet again created a character that fits Mark Wahlberg to perfection. To be honest, it's probably the latter. Because of that, if you liked Deep Water Horizon then you'll probably like this because his acting is the same in both (which works fine because it's similar type of emotion and adrenaline you'd expect from both situations). The character spread was also well done. You got to see the impacting/impacted characters early on and had a nice transition between their development as the movie progressed. My only reservation about the film is that it pretty much gives you no explanation as to why the bombing even happened. Sure, it's easy for people to shout that it was terrorism or a hate crime, or done by hateful people, but that isn't an explanation. It might be true, but it's not an explanation, it's blatant ignorance which the world can no longer afford. This film could have benefited so much from shedding some light on the bombers motivation!!! To be honest, they were actually the one part that let this film down, Their storyline was wasted on surface level personality development and retracing of their steps throughout the event. Instead, the film should have used that time to instead show their motivation to commit the acts. This would have deepened their storyline and given the movie as a whole, a much richer and more stimulating story. In saying that, Themo Melikidze did a great job of making a believable character out of the little depth he was given. All in all this was a good film, however, it does lack the depth and backbone necessary for a second viewing. helpful•76 50 nfirthpanetta Mar 18, 2017 Details Edit Release date November 17, 2017 (China) Countries of origin Hong Kong United States Official sites Facebook Instagram Languages English Chinese Arabic Also known as Ngày Định Mệnh Filming locations Mason St. Malden, Massachusetts, USA Production companies CBS Films Lionsgate TIK Films See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $45,000,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $31,886,361 Opening weekend US & Canada $161,306 Dec 25, 2016 Gross worldwide $52,185,751 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 2 hours 13 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Dolby Surround 7.1 Aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 Related news Alex Wolff To Star Opposite Kiersey Clemons In Sophie Kargman’s Thriller ‘Susie Searches’ Nov 16Deadline Film + TV Everything to Know About Your New Fave Rom-Com Leading Man, Jimmy O.
