Connections Featured in Late Night with Seth Meyers: Bobby Moynihan/Eugene Levy - Daniel Levy/The Bots (2015) User reviews984 Review Top review 10/10 A sweet, slow buzz; I love it! A killer cast mixing vets with fresh faces, Schitt's Creek is a great new cable comedy (although it airs on network TV in Canada.) The cinematography and production design remind me of Shameless; the sharp writing and unique characters remind me of Silicon Valley. The slow and steady pace reminds me of the Christopher Guest movies that O'Hara and Levy were in. It's a rich pedigree indeed. And it doesn't disappoint. I was puzzled why so many people didn't like it initially, but I think I get it: with a title like that, some people must have been expecting something juvenile, and laugh-a-minute. Schitt's Creek is much much better than that. The confidence on the part of the filmmakers is evidenced by the lack of a laugh track, and further, the musical score is used sparingly. It can be hilariously funny, but what really hooks me is that it has a heart and a sweetness that other shows might be afraid to show. There are no characters in the show that are unlikeable. It favors character development over easy laughs, and it may take a while for people to catch on to it, but to me this is a sweet slow buzz, and I am addicted. Can't wait for more. helpful•348 72 anon9999 Feb 1, 2015 FAQ6 If David Rose owns the town that his father bought for him, what does that actually mean? If he owns the town, does that mean he owns the land and if so shouldn't they be getting rent from the businesses and people who live there? If Roland does not own the hotel that the Roses stay in, how can Roland give permission for the Roses can stay there rent free? We know that it is a Canadian production with all Canadian actors, but where is this fictional town supposed to be? Is it supposed to be in America or Canada and have they made reference to this?
