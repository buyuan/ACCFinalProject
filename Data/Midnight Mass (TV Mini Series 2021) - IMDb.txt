Connections Featured in Chris Stuckmann Movie Reviews: Midnight Mass - Halloween Special (2021) User reviews1.5K Review Top review 8/10 Refreshingly methodical. Don't expect horror. This is NOT a horror. It is an extremely intelligent religious drama that contains some horror elements. And you know what? It is MAGNIFICENT at what it does. From episode 1, I knew I was in for a treat from Mike Flanagan. This man knows how to write unique, compelling characters. Each tragedy is explored so deeply and so personally that the shocking plot revelations become much more hard-hitting. Some of the dialogue is a little too intellectual to the point that it doesn't feel authentic, but it's always engaging nonetheless. Some of the story elements take too long to start truly making sense, but the conclusion is so satisfying that such a complaint sort of fades into the background. The religious themes in this story could have been handled very simply, but Flanagan never wants to give us the easy answer. I've never seen a story dive so deeply into the complexities of personal faith and organised religion to the extent or with the tact that this one does. This show will have me thinking for a long while yet. It's not perfect, but it's ambition has to be admired. What a unique tale. Hats off. helpful•482 131 benjaminskylerhill Sep 25, 2021 Details Edit Release date September 24, 2021 (Canada) Countries of origin Canada United States Official site Official Netflix Language English Also known as Thánh Lễ Ác Mộng Filming locations The Bridge Studios, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada Production companies Intrepid Pictures Netflix Studios See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 7 hours 30 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Atmos Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 2.00 : 1 Related news Zach Gilford (‘Midnight Mass’): Riley ‘takes responsibility’ for his troublesome past [Exclusive Video Interview] Nov 16Gold Derby Kate Siegel (‘Midnight Mass’): In her heart, ‘Erin always thought of herself as a runner’ [Exclusive Video Interview] Nov 15Gold Derby Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
