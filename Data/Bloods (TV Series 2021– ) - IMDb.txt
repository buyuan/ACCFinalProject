Filming on series two commences in London in August 2021. However, with Sky having already announced that they are closing the Sky One television channel in September 2021, Bloods series two is expected to switch to the refreshed sister channel Sky Comedy. Series 1 opened with 889,000 viewers but that rapidly fell to just 140,000 for episode 6, series 1 also garnered mixed reviews from critics. User reviews49 Review Top review 5/10 ZERO RESEARCH Whilst there are a few comical moments and some clever storylines, the fact that the writers have not spoken to one member of the Ambulance Service makes this series cringe-worthy and quire offensive. helpful•5 4 patricia-ashwood May 22, 2021 Details Edit Release date May 5, 2021 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Language English Also known as Фельдшеры Production company Roughcut TV See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 2.39:1 Related news Sky’s ‘Bloods’ Gets Hulu Deal, Second Season Underway; Gaumont UK Crime Thriller; Beach House Singapore Pact; C4 Commission — Global Briefs Nov 17Deadline Film + TV ‘Bloods’ Season 2 Begins Shoot, Season 1 to Stream on Hulu – Global Bulletin Nov 17Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Bloods (2021) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
