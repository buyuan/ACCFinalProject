They'd defeated international terrorist Owen Shaw and went their separate ways. But now, Shaw's brother, Deckard Shaw, is out killing the crew one by one for revenge. Worse, a Somalian terrorist called Jakarde and a shady government official called "Mr. Nobody" are both competing to steal a computer terrorism program called "God's Eye," that can turn any technological device into a weapon. Torretto must reconvene with his team to stop Shaw and retrieve the God's Eye program while caught in a power struggle between the terrorist and the United States government. â€”ahmetkozan car falling off a cliffstar died before releasebulletproof vestterroristrevenge355 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Vengeance hits home Genres Action Adventure Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for prolonged frenetic sequences of violence, action and mayhem, suggestive content and brief strong language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Body doubles, stunt doubles, and CGI were used to complete the film following Paul Walker's death. Walker's brothers Caleb Walker and Cody Walker were among the doubles, and also provided voice-over for the character Brian O'Conner. Goofs During the final fight between Toretto and Shaw, Vin Diesel's stunt double has much darker skin than Diesel. Quotes [last lines] Dominic Toretto: [remembering the time he had with Brian] I used to say I live my life a quarter mile at a time and I think that's why we were brothers - because you did too. No matter where you are, whether it's a quarter mile away or half way across the world, you'll always be with me. And you'll always be my brother. Crazy credits Before the credits, there is a title card that reads, "For Paul", dedicating the film to deceased star Paul Walker. Alternate versions The 140-minute extended version of the film has the following additions: No doubt the biggest addition is the longer opening sequence where Deckard narrates their shared past as children including him punished by their father for what Owen would steal. He also knew that Owen would end up in the current predicament despite being a gangster, smarter, better and being trained by him. It then continues to the theatrical-version's opening of laying the machine gun on Owen's chest before he leaves the hospital. A different line when Deckard responds to Hobbs why he's in his office: "I don't care for your computer. I'm here for the team that crippled my brother." The graveyard chase is slightly longer. The number of punches, kicks and head butts between Letty and Kara is almost doubled. The shootout at the warehouse is longer, especially it has Mr. Nobody killing a three more of Jakande's mercenaries.

Fast & Furious has become a huge recognizable name in action, today it stands as a huge box-office hit for distributor Universal Studios. With this anticipated seventh installment, they have pulled out the big guns on action, fun and surprisingly emotion as the series reaches new heights and its trademarks that make it recognized. The film lifts off where the previous 6th outing left, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) and crew are home in America having securing their amnesties and living their lives in peace with loved ones: with Toretto still helping his love Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) regain her memories and O'Connor adjusting to fatherhood to his growing son. But this peace will be shattered when one of their own is killed by the target cross-eye of Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) who is avenging his brother's demise. James Wan may be known for his contributions to horror-thriller genre (Insidious, The Conjuring, Saw and Death Sentence) but his direction and view of an action genre film is indeed an strong impression that left me and audiences in excitement. Wan proves that action is driven on speed, choreography and style and this makes F&F7 a worthy example of this. The action sequences are all big, loud and pack plenty of eye candy for action fans; from a rescue mission on a moving bus, building jumping, shootouts, fistfights and an explosive climax that takes place in an urban city. Practical stunts, assisting CGI and well-choreographed eye on detail make F&F7 worthy contender for visual effects and stunt awards in the coming year. Casting as always is close and fun in the F&F series, with Diesel, Walker, Rodriguez, Gibson, Bridges, Brewster and Johnson sharing the leading formula that makes their characters seem so likable, with Johnson, Russell, Hounsou, Emmanuel and Statham proving great supporting roles. But sadly here it is final acting appearance of the late Paul Walker (who had died in an unexpected event) which left the film in a stand-still and its cast and fans worldwide in deep sadness. The film was delayed for a year and a half but the result was something that would touch not only the audience but its crew and cast. The final scene indeed left people crying in the theater but it was a touching and emotionally connected moment that hasn't been seen in film in some years, it made me feel both sad and touched and feeling that the F&F series had ended perfectly as it won't be the same without Walker. Fast & Furious 7 is not only a fast driven action ride but in terms of quality, production value and emotion it proves to be the best of the series and one of this year's best films to have seen. It's only a thought now to see how Mad Max: Fury Road (releasing on May 14th 2015) will overthrow the action and car stunts that F&F7 has established a strong impression among audiences, but regardless this film will indeed be on your to 'see list'. Walker would have been deeply proud of how the film turned out in the end. 4/5 â€“ Nick & Jay helpfulâ€¢42 8 autisticreviewers Nov 10, 2015 FAQ4 Is 'Furious 7' based on a book?
