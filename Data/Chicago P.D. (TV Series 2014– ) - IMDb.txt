The actors/actresses trained for 3 months beforehand with retired S.W.A.T. personnel and real Chicago Police officers. Goofs Police officers consistently say a person was DOA which stands for Dead On Arrival (at a hospital) when the person is found dead at the scene of a crime. What they should say is DOS which stands for Dead On Scene. Connections Featured in The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon: David Spade/Sophia Bush/The Both (2014) User reviews240 Review Top review 10/10 Wonderful Show I'm not going to even lie, I was a little skeptical at first about this show. However, after watching it the first couple of weeks, I was really impressed. I started to find myself enjoying the show much more than I expected. I like the fact that all of the characters have a story line. Chicago Fire was already a great show but I like how the producer incorporates both shows together. Detective Voight was not my favorite person in the world when I first encountered him. However, after watching the show this First season, he is my favorite actor on the show now. Chicago PD is starting to become my favorite show on television. The action is great along with the characters! helpful•41 13 rashadlholmes May 6, 2014 FAQ1 Where can I find casting calls for Chicago PD?
