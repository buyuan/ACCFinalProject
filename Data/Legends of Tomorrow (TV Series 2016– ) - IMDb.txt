Connections Featured in DC's Legends of Tomorrow: Their Time Is Now (2016) User reviews505 Review Top review 9/10 Better Personally this show gets better and better every episode. I was skeptical about it after the first season. However, the current season has left me with a since of adventure every episode. The different totems powers have been very interesting and have definitely kept the interest in the show! I'm definitely looking forward to where this season is going to go as well as hoping there will be more seasons to come. helpful•50 27 kw-28529 Mar 20, 2018 FAQ2 Who is Rex Tyler?
