Mr. Callahan : [Mr. Callahan looks at Patrick's terrible attempt at the Shop class term project] You've gotta be kidding me. Patrick : If you fail me, you get me next semester. [cut to Patrick proudly announcing his C- in Shop] Patrick : [mimicking his shop teacher] The prick punch is not a toy! I learned that back in 'Nam in '68. 'Callahan,' Sergeant said, 'you put down that prick punch and go kill some gooks!' And you know what happened? That prick punch killed my best friend in a Saigon whore house. Mr. Callahan : I heard you were going to be in my class. Are you proud to be a senior having to take freshman shop, Patty-Cakes? Patrick : Look, my name is Patrick. Either you call me Patrick or you call me nothing. Mr. Callahan : Okay, Nothing. Charlie : [voice-over] I felt really bad for Patrick. He wasn't doing the impersonation to be mean or anything. He was just trying to make us freshmen feel better.
