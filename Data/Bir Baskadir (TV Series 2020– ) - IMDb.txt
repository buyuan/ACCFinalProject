User reviews167 Review Top review 9/10 Totally remarkable and unexpected masterpiece! I am an Anglo Canadian for context. This series is among the finest I have seen in a long time. This gem needs no polishing. Every aspect is absorbing without any pretentions. Despite the cultural setting of multiple slices of Turkish society enveloped in secular and traditional tensions; each of the characters was well developed and very real. The interactions between the characters are so brilliantly crafted they elevate the drama beyond national borders. The actors are completely new to me but have become instantly memorable. A follow-up series? Just do it! helpful•125 6 ppriest-3 Nov 22, 2020 FAQ3 What is the meaning of the old songs at the end titles?They are not included in subtitles in any language, but I feel they are somehow important to conclude each episode.
