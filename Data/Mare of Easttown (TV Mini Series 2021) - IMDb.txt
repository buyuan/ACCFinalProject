On the case is Detective Sergeant Mare Sheehan, a highly skilled crime investigator. She has spent all of her life in Easttown and knows everybody in it. However, her life is dark and troubled, due largely to the recent death of her son. —grantss. lesbian daughtermurdermurder investigationmissing persons casefemale detective25 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines All Truths Come to Light Genres Crime Drama Mystery Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia According to director Craig Zobel, Kate Winslet was the only actor confident enough to go back to her native accent in between takes; every other actor was terrified to let it go. For the cast and crew, witnessing Winslet immediately switch from a Delco accent to her normal English accent nonchalantly was an astonishing sight. Goofs Mare repeatedly refers to herself as a "Detective Sergeant". This is a British police rank. In the US, a police investigator would be referred to simply as "Detective" with their rank used separately. Mare's use of her rank is particularly odd with civilians for whom her status as a Sergeant would be meaningless. Connections Featured in Jeremy Vine: Episode #4.85 (2021) User reviews918 Review Top review 8/10 Love it so far This show kind of reminds me of The Outsider. It's dreary, depressing, and quite good. I'm hooked like a fish on a line. I feel Mare will soften up the closer her cases get to a resolution. I'm loving Evan Peters. It's good to see him play a different character than the loony ones he's played on American Horror Story. I look forward to the next episode. helpful•58 30 iamallsticky Apr 26, 2021 Details Edit Release date April 18, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site HBO Site (United States) Language English Also known as 东城梦魇 Filming locations Mont Clare, Pennsylvania, USA Production companies Home Box Office (HBO) Mayhem Pictures wiip studios See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 2.00 : 1 Related news HBO TV Show Ratings (updated 11/16/2021) Nov 16TVSeriesFinale.com What Is a Mayor of Kingstown Anyway?
