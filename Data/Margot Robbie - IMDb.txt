Personal Quote: [on doing nudity] It's not just with doing a naked scene, but any scene where you feel like you're going to make a fool of yourself. I just say, "You gotta go all out, you need to fully commit to this." Because if you half-ass it, it will look so stupid. But if you do it with complete conviction, often times you can pull it off.
