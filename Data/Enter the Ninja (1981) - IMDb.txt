Hired assassins ...human killing machines! Genres Action Crime Drama Thriller Certificate R Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Franco Nero's voice is dubbed. Cole is from Texas, and Nero couldn't master an American or Texas accent. Goofs Throughout the opening scenes, the white ninja moves around with a katana on his back. Later on, he shoots an arrow using his bow but where was the bow? Quotes Cole: I'll be back. Alternate versions The UK version was heavily cut by around 4-5 minutes by the BBFC when submitted in 1981. All shots of weapons that were not allowed in UK film releases at the time (e.g. nunchakus, shuriken etc) were cut, as were some highly-dangerous combat techniques such as throat-cuts, repeated punches, ear-claps and limb-and neck-breaking. Also missing is a scene that contravenes the UK's Cinematograph Films (Animals) Act 1937, namely some genuine scenes of cockfights. Video releases, plus the MIA DVD, all featured the same cut print. The 2011 Optimum DVD restores the violence though 1 min 5 secs are cut to remove the cockfight footage. Connections Featured in Sneak Previews: Night Shift/Smash Palace/Xica da Silva/An Officer and a Gentleman (1982) User reviews65 Review Top review A Good film This action film is about a westerner named Cole(Franco Nero) who has learned the ways of the Ninja, until a Hosagowa(Sho Kosugi) has bitter frustration against him after he realizes that Cole having the right to be a "Ninja Warrior". He later visits an old army buddy Frank(Alex Courtney) who is having some personal problems of his own with a greedy landgrabber named Charlie Venarious(Christopher George). However Cole has to take the matter of taking on the landgrabbers as well as Hosagawa who was just recently hired by Venarious to help eliminate Cole. The ending is very fascinating and the battle scenes between the Ninja warriors is the best sequence in this film. The cast is excellent in the film.
