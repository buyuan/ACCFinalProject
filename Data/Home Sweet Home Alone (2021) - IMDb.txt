Genres Action Comedy Family Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG for slapstick violence, rude material and some language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Chris Columbus, director of Home Alone (1990) and Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992), had the following to say when the topic of this reboot came up during an interview while promoting The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two (2020): "Nobody got in touch with me about it, and it's a waste of time as far as I'm concerned. What's the point? I'm a firm believer that you don't remake films that have had the longevity of Home Alone. You're not going to create lightning in a bottle again. It's just not going to happen. So why do it? It's like doing a paint-by-numbers version of a Disney animated film - a live-action version of that. What's the point? It's been done. Do your own thing. Even if you fail miserably, at least you have come up with something original." Quotes Hunter: Uh, this is garbage. I don't know why they are always trying to remake the classics. Never as good as the originals Connections Features Gee Whiz-z-z-z-z-z-z (1956) Soundtracks (There's No Place Like) Home for the Holidays Written by Robert Allen and Al Stillman Performed by Robert Goulet Courtesy of Columbia Records By arrangement with Sony Music Entertainment User reviews216 Review Top review 3/10 Going in Circles The rating on here is only low because people love the original Home Alone, so they will just review bomb it. That being said, this wasn't a good film. It had a straight to dvd quality about it apart from the cast. It just felt cheep. Even though I'm sure it wasn't. The story for me was also a mess. It doesn't give you a clear hero and villain which can be good but I don't know if that was the writer's intention. It's just like muddy. The main kid is an absolute brat. I would have left him home alone. And the "Villains" are decent people. The type of story telling that I hate the most is "whoops! It was all a big misunderstanding" because when it's over you feel like you just wasted your time. If people had made "human" decisions to begin with the film wouldn't have had to happen so it seems like it was all for nothing. It's like full of air. Which it's a kids movie so I can't complain too much. The ending is really sickly sweet which isn't my thing. I know that makes me sound harsh but I just don't love it when an ending is too saccharine. And like I said, the ending feels like you wasted an hour and a half because the issue could have been resolved in like 10 minutes. The acting is fine and there was thought put into the script. I could feel Mikey Day in the script, if that's a good thing I don't know. But I could definitely hear him in it. It's probably fine for kids, they might laugh when people fart in it? But no you can skip it. helpful•11 1 Golden_Hope Nov 12, 2021 Details Edit Release date November 12, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Disney+ Language English Also known as Home Alone 6 Filming locations Montreal, Canada Production companies 20th Century Studios Hutch Parker Entertainment See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 33 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Which Home Sweet Home Alone Character Are You, Based On Your Zodiac Sign?
