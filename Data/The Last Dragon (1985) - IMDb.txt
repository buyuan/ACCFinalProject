Connections Featured in At the Movies: The Slugger's Wife/Desperately Seeking Susan/The Last Dragon (1985) Soundtracks The Last Dragon Performed by Dwight David Written by Norman Whitfield, Bruce Miller Produced by Norman Whitfield for Johnny Boy Productions User reviews134 Review Top review 7/10 Art? No. Entertaining? Sho-nuff! Needless to say, this movie is incredibly cheesy. But it's also deceptively clever at times, and if you just go with it, it's a lot of fun. Leads Taimak and Vanity (yes, they each have only one name) are surrounded by a talented and colorful supporting cast, allowing them to do what they do best; look good (and in the case of Taimak) kick a lot of butt. It's sort of a mash-up of two of the most prominent b-movie genres of the 70s; Blaxploitation and Kung-Fu. But it's the 80s, so there's pop music and it has a happy ending. helpful•5 1 Fluke_Skywalker Jun 13, 2015 Details Edit Release date March 22, 1985 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Sony Movie Channel (United States) Language English Also known as Berry Gordy's The Last Dragon Filming locations New York City, New York, USA Production companies Delphi III Productions Motown Productions TriStar Pictures See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $10,000,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $25,754,284 Opening weekend US & Canada $5,254,359 Mar 24, 1985 Gross worldwide $25,754,284 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 49 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news ‘Encanto’ Preview: Disney and Lin-Manuel Miranda Embrace Latin America with Music and Magic Sep 29Indiewire Shang-Chi Payoff Poster Unleashes the Power of the Ten Rings Aug 9MovieWeb Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was The Last Dragon (1985) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
