Apparently, this was because the "w" was accidentally left out of her first movie titles, and she just 'went with it'. Goofs Miami is six feet above sea level today. New Orleans is 1 to 2 feet below. If Miami was flooded, New Orleans would be too. Quotes Nick Bannister: The past can haunt a man. That's what they say. That the past is just a series of moments. Each one perfect. Complete. A bead on the necklace of time. The past doesn't haunt us. Wouldn't even recognize us. If there are ghosts to be found, it's us who haunt the past. We haunt it, so we can look again. See the people we miss, and the things we missed about them.

I'm not going to discuss the movie at length, others will do that definitely, I'll just say that I left the theater feeling absolutely nothing. I was not attached to any of the characters during any part of the movie, with such great cast and Lisa Joy at the helm it's hard to miss the point, but I think Reminiscence has missed it. The story wants to be on one side of a disbanded/chaotic near future, and on another side a heavily policed and rule abiding citizens kind of future. The cast is awesome, but there's absolutely no chemistry between them, I honestly feel like Hugh had more charisma and chemistry playing that teacher that was convicted for embezzlement. And every other moral or lesson falls totally flat because of this weird world Lisa Joy has built and the lack of chemistry between the cast and the view with the cast. It's a bit tragic to see something like this go to waste. helpful•102 78 ArthurianX Aug 19, 2021 Details Edit Release date August 20, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Languages English Mandarin Spanish Also known as The Jade Earring Filming locations New Orleans, Louisiana, USA Production companies FilmNation Entertainment Kilter Films Michael De Luca Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $54,000,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $3,900,193 Opening weekend US & Canada $1,950,793 Aug 22, 2021 Gross worldwide $15,800,193 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 56 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Atmos Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 2.39 : 1 Related news Streaming Wars III: HBO Max, Apple TV+ Picking Up Steam Nov 12Trailers from Hell New to HBO Max in November 2021: King Richard, The Sex Lives Of College Girls, Black And Missing & More Oct 25Film-Book Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
