Connections Featured in WatchMojo: Top 20 Anime Everyone Needs To Watch (2021) Soundtracks Re:Re: Performed by Asian Kung-Fu Generation User reviews157 Review Top review 9/10 Realism with some sweet Supernatural Touch is the Key of Success of this Anime Erased is one of my favorite anime. It is so natural and real. This has a strong message about Believing which itself a metaphor of hope and will. It may be turf for someone to understand the whole premises first but I advise that please float straight obtained to the stream and you will find all the answers. The Animation is actually soothing and the story really catches my nerves. here I am mentioning the plus points of this anime 1. It is so realistic in its story, characters and screenplays 2. The Hero is pretty much suitable with the stream as he is as normal as other human beings. He takes his lessons from his faults and that is the key of his success 3. The musics, textures and special mentioning the OP is really great. 4. The messages that it throws to our society are really spell bounding. 5. Mental and Relational strong Bonding between characters.(Mother- son) 6. And lots more. It says when a man lost his all hopes and doesn't want to stand again against his problems, then he have to ruminate the smiling face of his close peoples whom for he is OK on this earth and thus give him the sprite of fighting again.(I think this message is really needed into our present society) (Here I am Putting my own opinion about its realism. So I mention Death Note Anime....Please don't misunderstood me. It is on purpose) we know Death Note is another mystic Anime but if you just thought about the main protagonists of that anime for a minute, you can come to the point that they are actually supernaturally talented who barely do any faults, that is coincidental and unrealistic. It has no good for us as they are not normal. But for this anime the main protagonist is nothing but a simple man who gets success by doing faults. So for this reason it is real and super that can inspire some people at least. Thanks for paying your time to read this. I know I bring forth many commotion facts that may be offensive for you but I request you to compromise with the fact. Thanks Again. helpful•17 2 SaptarshiForYou Sep 5, 2017 Details Edit Release date January 7, 2016 (Japan) Country of origin Japan Official sites Official site (Japan) Offiical Twitter (Japan) Language Japanese Also known as Erased Production companies A-1 Pictures Aniplex America Aniplex See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 4 hours 24 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 16 : 9 2.35 : 1 Related news Are We Going To See an Erased Season 2?
