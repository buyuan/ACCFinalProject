Less Zombies. Genres Action Comedy Crime Horror Romance Thriller Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Brad puts on a Richard Nixon mask during the Prague bank robbery. This is a nod to the 1991 heist movie, Point Break, starting Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swazye. Goofs A main plot point in this film involves agents from INTERPOL attempting to apprehend the thieves and getting thwarted while actively pursuing them. In point of fact, INTERPOL is not a law enforcement agency and none of their agents have any law enforcement or arrest powers. INTERPOL acts as a liaison between law enforcement across member nations and offers databases, technical and operational support to and between member nations. Quotes Gwendoline: When she was ten, using only her laptop, she bypassed the security systems for a major motion picture studio and stole an early copy of Pirates of the Caribbean 2. Dieter: Holy shit. I remember when that was leaked. That was her? Korina: Yes, that was me. Gwendoline: She's done cooler things. I just figured that would interest you the most, seeing as you're... Well... Korina: Nerd. Gwendoline: Not really a way to make friends. Korina: I meant it as a compliment from a nerd to another nerd. [Dieter rubs his eyes and sniffles] Korina: No need to cry. Dieter: My tears are because I have a cat allergy. [he nods to Gwen] Dieter: Cat allergy. But thank you for the compliment, Miss Dominguez.

The safecracking is repetitive and the police chasing was lazy. The movie tried to be self aware but it didn't work. The team lacked chemistry and acting was only okay. Only good thing going is stunning visuals. helpful•77 34 Calicodreamin Nov 1, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 29, 2021 (Germany) Countries of origin Germany United States Official site Official Netflix Languages English French German Czech Portuguese Also known as 行盗之师 Filming locations Obersalzberg, Berchtesgaden, Bavaria, Germany Production companies Pantaleon Films The Stone Quarry Film United See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 2 hours 7 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Atmos Aspect ratio 2:1 Related news Movie Review – Army of Thieves (2021) Nov 13Flickeringmyth ‘Army of Thieves’ Review (Netflix) Nov 10Nerdly Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
