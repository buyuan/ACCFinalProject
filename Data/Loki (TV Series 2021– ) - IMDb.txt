Quotes Loki: You're taking me somewhere to kill me? Mobius: No, I'm taking you some place to talk. Loki: Well, I don't like to talk. Mobius: But you do like to lie. Which you just did, 'cause we both know you love to talk. Crazy credits The Marvel Studios logo turns green and gold, Loki's colors. Connections Edited from Avengers: Endgame (2019) User reviews1.7K Review Top review 8/10 Surprisingly fresh, clever, well-acted and engaging Didn't expect this to have as much heart as it does, but damn - it really came through. I'm so glad Tom Hiddleston became Loki because he has the perfect mischievous charm one would expect. There's a nice cheekiness to the whole series that plays itself well, and the intense world building is so detailed and done with ease that it hardly feels like you're trying to be sold on the world. Without any spoilers, the plot is well thought out, the characters were well chosen, and it had a great balance of emotional gravitas and humour. Absolutely the best Marvel TV series they put out. helpful•10 3 dragonstealeye Oct 8, 2021 Details Edit Release date June 9, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Disney+ Language English Also known as 洛基 Filming locations Atlanta, Georgia, USA Production company Marvel Studios See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Dolby Atmos Aspect ratio 2.39 : 1 Related news Critics Choice Awards Voters’ Guide: 2022 TV Races Heat Up, Thanks in Great Part to ‘Squid Game’ Nov 17Variety Film + TV Hawkeye Director Teases Yelena Belova And Clint's First Meeting: 'We Know Their Past' Nov 17Slash Film Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
