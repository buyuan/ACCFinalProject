It's confusing. It's awkward. It's family. Genres Comedy Drama Romance Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for some innuendo Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Improvisation was encouraged during filming. One such case was the line: "This corn is like an angel." Allison Pill's (Jane) stoic expression turns into a failed attempt to hold back a grin. The outtakes show that the entire cast soon burst out laughing. Goofs Dan stops for gas in New Jersey while he and the girls are driving up to the family's house. He is shown pumping gas. While it is against the law in New Jersey to pump your own gas, it is sometimes done and usually overlooked as an infraction by station staff. Quotes Cara Burns: You don't have to worry because when it comes to sex, Marty is the one that wants to wait. Dan Burns: What part of that sentence is supposed to give me comfort?

At a large family homecoming Dan meets his perfect woman, only to find out that she is in a relationship with his brother. What's a man to do? I rather liked "Dan In Real Life", but I would imagine the success or otherwise of this flick is going to be down to whether you are willing to accept Steve Carell playing a part relatively straight and restrained, rather than going through the broad comedy moves that have made him so successful. If you cannot accept it, fear not, "Get Smart" will be along later in the year, but for the record I thought he was very good. "Dan In Real Life" starts off like your typical, incidentally amusing, family drama, but it gets funnier and funnier as it goes along and Carell's frustration with his situation grows. It's not massively original (but if you only saw movies with original ideas, cinematic pickings would be very scarce indeed, wouldn't they?), but "Dan In Real Life" is entertaining, and a good cast (who wouldn't fall in love at first sight with the luminous Juliette Binoche?) make the most of an insightful enough script that contains many a ponder on the meaning and passion of love. I hope that Steve Carell pushes himself and does something as interesting again. helpful•65 22 seawalker Jan 15, 2008 FAQ1 Are Russel Woron-Simons and Jaclyn Sabogal, more commonly known as "The Bakery Teens," dating?
