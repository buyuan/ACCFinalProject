Connections Referenced in WatchMojo: Top 10 Most Anticipated Horror Movies of 2022 (2021) User reviews6 Review Top review 10/10 One of the Best I watched this movie in mid-2021 in a pre-screening, it killed me that I couldn't buy or talk about one of my favorite movies. I was not expecting what I saw in that theater. I didn't have super high hopes but I was proven wrong very very quickly. Would highly suggest watching it, it has some great acting, a great plot, and a satisfying ending. helpful•71 25 bubbabearak Oct 14, 2021 Details Edit Release date February 4, 2022 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Official Facebook Official Instagram Language English Also known as Điện Thoại Đen Filming locations Wilmington, North Carolina, USA Production companies Universal Pictures Blumhouse Productions Crooked Highway See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 42 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 2.39 : 1 Related news Mel Gibson, Mason Thames to Star in Adventure Fantasy ‘Boys of Summer’ Nov 4The Hollywood Reporter - Film + TV [Video] Final Flame Productions Recreates Trailer For ‘The Black Phone’ in ‘Grand Theft Auto V’ Nov 1bloody-disgusting.com Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Canadian French language plot outline for The Black Phone (2021)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
