I own the Playstation version of this game, and it's particularly poor. The game-play is appalling and the 3D graphics leave something to be desired; not bad for the Playstation, but it has certainly been improved by many other games. I like the idea of customising the questions to your own specification, thus you may have more questions on a particular subject and less on another, and so on, but the fact that the rules of the game are explained to you BEFORE you actually see and hear Anne introduce the show is plain stupid! Realistic as far as banking and voting other contestants off is concerned, but why didn't the game designers get Anne to actually read out the questions? I know there are about 100,000 questions in the game, but I'm pretty sure Mrs. Robinson has asked more than that on the real TV show! The computer characters are amusing, but the loading times can't be so easily forgiven. I'd rather stick with the real thing on the telly than play this poor adaptation, although due to so many questions, it can certainly improve your general knowledge. 4/10 helpful•0 0 jamiecostelo58 Jan 3, 2007 Details Edit Country of origin United Kingdom Language English Production company Activision See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Color Color Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
