Genres Comedy Romance Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Lisa Kudrow and her best friend wrote "Smelly Cat" one night when they were drunk, and it eventually got written into the show. Goofs Rachel's birthday: In episode 4x05, she says she was born on May the 5th (Taurus) but later, in 7x22, when a policeman asks for her driver's license, he looks at her birth date and remarks that she is an Aquarius (January/February). Quotes Rachel: See? Unisex. Joey: Maybe *you* need sex. I just had it a few days ago. Rachel: No, Joey, U-N-I-sex. Joey: I wouldn't say no to that. Crazy credits After Courtney Cox married David Arquette, they added 'Arquette' to the end of the entire cast and crew's names in the credits to honor the marriage. Alternate versions In the DVD version of "The One After I Do" from season 8, there was a part when Chandler was dancing in slippery shoes with Judy Geller and slips and tears down Judy's dress. The scene was not added in the television version. Connections Edited into Friends: The One Before the Last One - Ten Years of Friends (2004) Soundtracks I'll Be There For You (Title Theme) Composed by Michael Skloff Lyrics by Allee Willis Performed by The Rembrandts User reviews1.8K Review Top review 9/10 Laugh out loud funny! I still love Friends just as much now than I did when it was on 15-20 years ago. It's just one of those all-time great sitcoms that's just as funny watching reruns as it was watching it for the first time! Not many shows are just as funny today as they were 15-20 years ago but Friends is absolutely one of those shows! All 6 characters are almost equally as funny! This truly is one of the best comedies that has ever been made! helpful•17 2 Supermanfan-13 May 18, 2021 FAQ10 What is Friends and What is it about? In MAD ABOUT YOU, which premiered in 1992, Lisa Kudrow plays a recurring, flighty waitress called Ursula. Both shows take place in the lower west side of NYC. Is this character supposed to be Phoebe's twin sister from FRIENDS? What are the words for Phoebe's song "Smelly Cat"?
