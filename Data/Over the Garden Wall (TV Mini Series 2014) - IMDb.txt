Connections Featured in Late Night with Seth Meyers: Elijah Wood/Cecily Strong/Ella Henderson (2014) User reviews158 Review Top review 10/10 Beautiful and Dark From the first second the dark and enchanting atmosphere pulls you right in. Greg's fearlessness and Wirt's worries, their love for each other creates a wonderful dynamic. Maybe it's not everyone's cup of tea, but I'd advise you to give it a try. Ten 10-12 minutes episodes, it takes about 2 hours to finish the whole series. Watching it like a film is reccomended. helpful•40 1 indusolara Jun 3, 2019 FAQ1 Anyone please could recommend a series as good as this one?
