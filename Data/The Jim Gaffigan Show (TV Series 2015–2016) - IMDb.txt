Connections Featured in The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon: Vince Vaughn/Jim Gaffigan/Ryn Weaver (2015) User reviews17 Review Top review 10/10 What a pleasant surprise I have never really been a Jim Gaffigan fan. Sure, he's funny, but far from one of my favorite stand ups. As such, I am greatly surprised by how good this show is - in my view, one of the best comedies headed by a stand up comedian in years. The chemistry with Ashley Williams is believable and balanced, she is not just a prop, but in fact very funny herself.... I especially enjoyed seeing her come to life in Episode 4, rather than just playing the boring "frustrated" housewife. Michael Ian Black is awesome as the snarly homo friend, and Adam Goldberg is finally in a role where he get's a bit of depth, rather than just being the token angry a..hole, which usually get's old really fast in his previous work. All in all, this show is well written, well acted and well produced, and highly recommended to anyone who also like current shows like You're the worst (which I put this show on par with) and Married (which I rank slightly below The Jim Gaffigan Show). helpful•29 8 nickbrockdorff Aug 9, 2015 Details Edit Release date July 15, 2015 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Шоу Гэффигана Filming locations New York City, New York, USA Production company Jax Media See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 30 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news TV Land TV Show Ratings (updated 9/2/2021) Sep 3TVSeriesFinale.com Kimberly Williams-Paisley and Sister Ashley Williams to Star Together in 2 Hallmark Christmas Films Aug 26TVfanatic Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was The Jim Gaffigan Show (2015) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
