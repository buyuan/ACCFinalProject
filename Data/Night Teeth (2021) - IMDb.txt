His task: drive two mysterious young women (Debby Ryan and Lucy Fry) around Los Angeles for a night of party hopping. Taken captive by his clients' charm, he soon learns that his passengers have their own plans for him - and an insatiable thirst for blood. As his night spins out of control, Benny is thrust into the middle of a clandestine war that pits rival tribes of vampires against the protectors of the human world, led by his brother (Raúl Castillo), who will stop at nothing to send them back into the shadows. With sunrise fast approaching, Benny is forced to choose between fear and temptation if he wants to stay alive and save the City of Angels. —Netflix vampirefightyoungwomanlife7 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Paint the Town Red Genres Action Crime Drama Fantasy Horror Thriller Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Megan Fox and Sydney Sweeney only had 1 night of filming Goofs As Blair and Benny kiss by the pool, Benny puts his knee up on the seat.

However, when taking a deep dive into the plot, it was a bit aimless and lacked depth. Almost like arriving at a game already in progress and leaving before it finishes. helpful•37 16 Calicodreamin Oct 21, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 20, 2021 (United Kingdom) Countries of origin United Kingdom United States Official site Netflix Site Languages English Spanish Also known as Nanh Sắc Trong Đêm Filming locations Los Angeles, California, USA Production companies Netflix 42 Unique Features See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 47 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 2.39 : 1 Related news International Insider: Disney+ Day; Netflix Asian Play; ITV Profits Rocket; Mega Bake Off Deal Nov 12Deadline Film + TV ‘Class of ’09’: Raúl Castillo, Jake McDorman, Sepideh Moafi, Brian J.
