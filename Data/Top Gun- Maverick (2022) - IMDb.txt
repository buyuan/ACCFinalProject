Goofs The Rear Admiral played by Ed Harris, when referring to Maverick's service record states ".....The only man to shoot down three enemy planes in the last 40 years". This is incorrect as Flight Lieutenant David Morgan, RAF, shot down 4 enemy Argentinian aircraft during the Falklands War of 1982. Quotes Rear Admiral: Thirty-plus years of service. Combat medals. Citations. Only man to shoot down three enemy planes in the last 40 years. Yet you can't get a promotion, you won't retire, and despite your best efforts, you refuse to die. You should be at least a two-star Admiral by now, yet here you are. Captain. Why is that? [pause] Maverick: It's one of life's mysteries, sir. Connections Featured in Conan: Tom Cruise (2019) FAQ1 In the Trailer, Maverick is seen buzzing a base in a strange-looking black-colored aircraft. What is this aircraft?
