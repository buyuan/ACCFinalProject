As a member of the Honeybees, Bessie wears her uniform every single day, leads her troop with a zeal General Patton would have admired and has earned more Bee Badges than any Honeybee in history. But a bunch of badges still elude her, and Bessie's not stopping until she has every last one. —Nicole Parker, Joanna Roses animal character name as titlepunctuation in series titlefemale protagonistchild protagonistgirl6 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Animation Short Comedy Family Certificate TV-Y7 Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia In the episode,"Oh say can Bess-see," a reference to the monolith of,"2001: A Space Odyssey," can be made. Connections Featured in MsMojo: Top 10 Animated TV Shows with Female Leads (2018) Soundtracks The Mighty B! Main Title Theme Music & Lyrics by Amy Miles & Michael Robertson User reviews28 Review Top review 7/10 The Mighty B gets a B- A lot of the time when it comes to Nickelodeon tv shows I don't buck the trend, but here I do. The Mighty B is a rather good show, although not perfect by any means. The animation is very expressive and animated. This is one of the times where flash animation was the right choice. I didn't find Bessie as annoying as others thought she was. Maybe it's because I spent a lot of time with small children when I was in foster care, but I seem to have an immunity to annoying characters in media in general. There are times, though, where she will grate on you, though luckily, not to the extent of the actual characters in the show. Overall, if your looking for a solid mid-2000s Nicktoon, you may find it here, despite there being a few duds in the episode listing. helpful•1 0 tobiaskellyreddit Jul 1, 2020 Details Edit Release date April 26, 2008 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Nick.com Language English Also known as Super Scout Production companies Paper Kite Productions Polka Dot Pictures Nickelodeon Animation Studios See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 24 minutes Color Color Related news Amy Poehler and Will Arnett Expecting a Baby Apr 28PEOPLE.com Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the French language plot outline for The Mighty B!
