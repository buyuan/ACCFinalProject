While returning home, she does not catch the train in the subway. But in another possibility of her life, she catches the train in the subway. The story shows two parallel lives of Helen: in one life, she stays with her boyfriend Gerry, and in the other life, she finds that Gerry cheats her with Lydia and falls in love with James Hammerton. —Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil multiple outcomestwist of fateserendipityparallel timedestiny274 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines There are two sides to every story. Helen is about to live both of them ...at the same time. Romance was never this much fun. Genres Comedy Drama Fantasy Romance Certificate PG-13 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia John Hannah is partly responsible for the film getting made after the funding collapsed. He coincidentally happened to be in a meeting with Hollywood hotshot Sydney Pollack and casually mentioned this great screenplay he was hoping to make. Pollack was sufficiently interested to read the script and immediately sorted out the funding. Goofs Gerry makes a joke about withdrawing Helen's Class One Drugs. Great Britain uses an alphabetical classification system so class one should be class A. Quotes James: Cheer up. Remember what the Monty Python boys say. Helen: "Always look on the bright side of life"? James: No, "Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition." Crazy credits The film's copyright year in the credits is 1997. Alternate versions US version was cut for language by Miramax to secure a PG-13 rating.

John Hannah is simply adorable as James and his Glaswegian sense of humour still makes me laugh out loud even though I know the jokes in advance. Every performance is great but Gwynyth Paltrow deserves a special mention for her faultless role as two different versions of the same woman at once. Without giving anything away, I did not see the ending coming at all the first time through but it was entirely satisfying without being cloyingly Hollywood. Don't expect a cultural masterpiece. Just 'the Spanish inquisition' and some fine entertainment.
