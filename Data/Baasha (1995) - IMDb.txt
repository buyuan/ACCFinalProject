Goofs One of the promises that Manikam makes to his dying father is to get a Medical College seat for his younger sister without letting anyone know about Manikam's secret identity. However Manikkam does reveal his secret identity to the college principal to scare him so that he gives a seat to Manikkam's sister. Hence when Manikkam says "Dad, I have fulfilled your dying wishes", it is not true. Quotes Badsha: My name is Manikkam. I do have another name...!

Chithra User reviews25 Review Top review 8/10 Baasha The movie was excellent with many mass scenes and punch dialogues. The movie was interesting. But some scenes were not logic in the movie. Rajinikanth acted good in the movie and also Raghuvaran is the main highlight in the movie. helpful•0 0 santhosh-10290 Jul 16, 2019 Details Edit Release date January 15, 1995 (India) Country of origin India Language Tamil Also known as Baashha Production company Sathya Movies See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross worldwide ₹250,000,000 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 2 hours 25 minutes Color Color Related news Nagma shares throwback pics with superstar Rajnikanth Dec 22The News Minute Actor Anupama Parameswaran showcases her artistic skills on Instagram Dec 1The News Minute Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Baasha (1995) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Most anticipated Indian movies and shows Percentage shows amount of top page views. 1Marakkar: Lion of the Arabian Sea39.1% 2Ram Asur24.4% 3Bunty Aur Babli 28.3% 4RRR5.5% 5Antim: The Final Truth5.2% 6Matsya Kaand4.3% 7Pushpa: The Rise - Part 14.2% 8Satyameva Jayate 23.7% 9Dangerous2.8% 10Minnal Murali2.6% Updates approximately every 20 minutes.
