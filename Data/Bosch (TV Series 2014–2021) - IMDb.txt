Like any good protagonist he has problems with authority, follows his gut and bends a few rules while achieving the best solved case rate in all of California. Whatever situations the writers put him into he will undoubtedly be entertaining as he pursues justice. father daughter relationshiphomicide detectivepolice proceduralpolice detectivebased on novel19 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Based on the best selling novels by Michael Connelly. Genres Crime Drama Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia In response to the showrunners' quest for verisimilitude, the production was granted permission (a first) to film inside the actual L.A.P.D. Hollywood Station (1358 Wilcox Avenue) where the shooting was done late in the day after most of the detectives had left. Various off-duty police volunteered their time to play extras. Goofs All California emergency vehicles have to have a steady burn solid red light to the front. LAPD uses 1 of the LED pods in their roof light bar for this. Police cars in this series do not have such a light, while the in-car lights for the unmarked vehicles are correct (one red steady burn, one blue blinking). Quotes Jerry Edgar: Golf is a great sport. Harry Bosch: Golf is not a great sport. If you can smoke and drink while doing it, it's not a sport. Connections Featured in The Crime Thriller Club: Episode #2.3 (2014) Soundtracks Can't Let Go (uncredited) Written by Jesse Nolan Performed by Caught A Ghost User reviews675 Review Top review 9/10 What can I say about this series? Characters so humanized and with real problems that make you identify with them. Intertwined stories and plots that make you learn a lot about how the judicial, police and government systems work, with all their bureaucracies and facets. And a very good soundtrack that influenced me in a good way listen to Jazz. I recommend this series without reservations. helpful•34 2 rafa-a-t-silva Jul 23, 2020 FAQ4 Bosch Season 6 Episode 10 there was a military funeral at the end. Who was It for?
