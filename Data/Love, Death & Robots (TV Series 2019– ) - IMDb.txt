Just saw it while browsing netflix, didn't knew what to expect. But the first episode just blew my mind. So awesome. It was like watching watching a video game. The episodes are small but so good. No nonsense. Superb !!! helpful•203 89 ankitb-civilengg Mar 15, 2019 FAQ3 Is there chances for a second season for this series? I'd be up to watch for sure. The space story, is that all cgi or real actors? Did Netflix reorder the episodes of this series or were they always in the wrong order on this page?
