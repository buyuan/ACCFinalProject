Personal Quote: [2017, reflecting on leaving The Vampire Diaries (2009) in 2015] That was the plan from the get-go. If anything, the fact that [leaving] terrified me drove me even more. I needed to feel that fear of "Oh, my God, what if I never get a job again?". That just made me want to work five times as hard to make sure that didn't happen.
