She tells the tale of their friendship, which started at school in the 1950s. Set in a dangerous but fascinating Naples, it is just the start of a story spanning sixty years of life. A tale that attempts to unveil the mystery of Lila, Elena's brilliant friend. Her best friend, and her worst enemy. friendfriendshipgirlitalygirl friend9 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genre Drama Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia While her family was on summer vacation in Oslo (Norway), child actress Elisa del Genio landed a role by sheer happenstance after HBO called her mother about scheduling a meeting with her brother Alberto for a part in their TV series. Elisa accompanied Alberto to the audition and HBO ended up choosing her instead. Connections Featured in CBS News Sunday Morning: Episode #42.13 (2020) User reviews124 Review Top review 10/10 Stunning. I have just finished season 1 and I loved it. It absolutely has the feel and pathos of neo-realism. All the despair, rage, and violence of post-war Italy is there that Rossellini, Di Seca and Fellini brought to their work. Every aspect of the production, the sets, the casting, the particular method of acting, the direction, gives the sense that it was filmed 60-70 years ago. The difference is that it's focus is on the inner lives of women, although the men play heavily in it as well. Because I love Italian neo-realism, I was enraptured by it. Because the story is about girls and their transformation into women under oppressive and desperate circumstances, I am all in. helpful•44 3 ical-rox Dec 23, 2018 FAQ1 Why did Fernando Cerullo get so angry over the shoes Rino gave him for Christmas?
