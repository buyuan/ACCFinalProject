But Chelsea's tough, sometimes judgemental exterior starts to soften as she gets to know her new friends, and they begin to form an unlikely found family. friendsistersocial mediasmartnetflix original6 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Happiness is a no-brainer Genres Comedy Drama Romance Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia The series had a very quick turnaround time. It was greenlit on March 5th, 2021. It filmed from early April to early July for 3 months that same year and then premiered on Netflix on October 8th, 2021 with a 10-epiode first season, only 7 months after being greenlit. User reviews111 Review Top review 7/10 Its OK There aren't too many good netflix sitcoms so i wasn't expecting much. I'm a fan of emily osment, but she is the only reason I watch. Chelsea's sister is likeable but her friends are annoying and over the top, especially jayden. Right now its a good time pacfier but nothing special. helpful•13 12 AdrienneGrayceMusic Oct 9, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 8, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Netflix Site Language English Also known as جميلات شكلًا ومضمونًا Filming locations Los Angeles, California, USA Production company Netflix Studios See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 30 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news Halston Sage Indie ‘The List’ Adds Christian Navarro And Gregg Sulkin Oct 28Deadline Film + TV Netflix's Pretty Smart Proves That Hot Dummies Have Feelings Too — Grade It!
