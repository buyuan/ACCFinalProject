I'm still looking forward to it, because this series isn't it. You won't learn much about the history of the first civilizations the way you do if you watch other PBS shows - there's little information about how First People lived once upon a time (diet, housing, building techniques, daily life, local animals and plants that were vital to them, theories about why civilizations dissolved, how the dead were buried, etc.), the role of women in the various civilizations that came and went, relations between tribes, different ways groups governed themselves, etc. This series is more of a celebration of how people NOW, descended from the First Peoples of in North America, feel about their past, how they view their history from an emotional point of view, their perceptions of the past - and that's absolutely fine, and interesting if you don't know about their feelings, emotions and perceptions, which many people don't. Everyone presents a very romanticized view that make the past sound like all was perfect and in harmony, with no wars, no conflict, no problems at all - and I don't think any civilization, past or present, can claim that. helpful•19 2 jcravens42 Nov 19, 2018 Details Edit Release date October 23, 2018 (United States) Countries of origin United States Canada Italy Mexico Peru Official site Official site Language English Also known as La grande histoire des peuples d'Amérique Production company Providence Pictures See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 4 hours Color Color Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Native America (2018) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
