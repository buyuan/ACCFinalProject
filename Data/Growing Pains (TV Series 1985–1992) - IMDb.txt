As long as they got each other, nothing else matters... —Xenophon Tsakanikas <ftpadmin@antigoni.med.auth.gr> long islandchildren1990snew yorksitcom21 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Comedy Family Certificate TV-G Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia Alan Thicke and Joanna Kerns were both recently divorced when cast for the series.

Connections Featured in The Willies (1990) User reviews48 Review Top review 7/10 It's not the best but it sure beats most other shows After the family ties success on NBC, ABC developed Growing Pains to rival it about the Seavers with their 3 children in Long Island, New York. Nobody in this show has the New York accent but it still beats other shows. Kirk Cameron became a huge teen star in the eighties. Tracey Gold shined as the middle sister, Carol Seaver. Alan Thicke finally had a successful show in his lifetime and Joanna Kerns came out of her big sister Donna Devarona's shadows as the Growing Pains mom. The writing could have been better and the show could have equaled Family Ties but nowadays, a show like this would have got Emmys. Sure, it was sweet and full of saccharine but I miss it now. helpful•10 7 Sylviastel Jun 26, 2002 Details Edit Release date September 8, 1986 (China) Also known as 成长的烦恼 Filming locations Columbia/Warner Bros.
