User reviews535 Review Top review 10/10 A black and white gem which shines the brightest It's not hard to make a tv series especially on a topic that you have lived... It's like making or writing your own stories so it was not hard for tvf guys because they have lived the life themselves. But, it is not a web series like other. It is a study of the situation and not simply presenting the situation. How we feel, why we feel it, how does it impact our behaviour voluntarily or involuntary. Everything has a meaning including the black and white scheme of the series... Which describes a rather colourless and one dimensional life of a student who has been living with blinders. The while series is a study of all this behaviour. Thank you from bottom of my heart... helpful•46 5 mesingh May 6, 2019 Details Edit Release date April 16, 2019 (India) Country of origin India Official sites Official Netflix TVF Play Language Hindi Also known as عالم كوتا Filming locations Kota, Rajasthan, India Production companies Contagious Online Media Network The Viral Fever See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 45 minutes Color Black and White Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news New on Netflix: September 2021 Releases Aug 31Den of Geek New on Netflix in September 2021 Aug 25Gold Derby Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode Most anticipated Indian movies and shows Percentage shows amount of top page views. 1Marakkar: Lion of the Arabian Sea38.9% 2Ram Asur24.6% 3Bunty Aur Babli 28.3% 4RRR5.5% 5Antim: The Final Truth5.1% 6Pushpa: The Rise - Part 14.3% 7Matsya Kaand4.2% 8Satyameva Jayate 23.6% 9Dangerous2.8% 10Minnal Murali2.6% Updates approximately every 20 minutes.
