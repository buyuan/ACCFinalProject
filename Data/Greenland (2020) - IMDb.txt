Genres Action Drama Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of disaster action, some violence, bloody images and brief strong language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The comet is named "Clarke," in a tribute to the late Arthur C. Clarke, author of the 1993 novel "Hammer of God," which describes the impact on Earth of a planet-killing asteroid. The novel predates the movies Armageddon (1998) and Deep Impact (1998), which deal with similar events. Goofs When the soldiers "wand" the family with metal detectors, they would have discovered Nathan's insulin pump. Then they would have told the family "no chronic diseases" and the family would have stayed together at that point. However, the pump ( nor their cellphones, keys etc. ) wasn't detected, because the wands were only looking for very large metal objects, such as handguns, not smaller objects, which would have needed close "wanding" over the people's bodies and limbs, not a cursory wave over just the body. Quotes Nathan Garrity: My friend Teddy says your life flashes in front of your eyes when you die. I think it would be better if it did that while you lived. That way, you could see all the good memories and be happy.

This movie is awesome. I swear people are so hard to please these days. This film definitely had my heart racing. It got extremely intense there several times. This has to be one of my favorite disaster flicks. Deep Impact eat your heart out. I highly recommend giving this movie a watch. 8 stars üëçüëç helpful‚Ä¢368 216 Draysan-Jennings Nov 14, 2020 FAQ2 Is there a release date?
