Soundtracks GOM Written and performed by Clarice Jensen Courtesy of Geographic North User reviews67 Review Top review 5/10 Starts Out Interesting But Descends Into Messiness As one of the most notorious serial killers of all time, Ted Bundy is a figure who will always attract fascination/interest. "No Man of God" tries to tap into some of that historical and psychological intrigue, but ultimately ends up short of the mark due to a lack of focus on any specific topic or theme. For a very basic overview, this film focuses on the late-1980s relationship between the incarcerated Bundy (Luke Kirby) and young FBI agent Bill Hagmaier (Elijah Wood) working in the relatively new "profiling" division. Over time, the pairing form a bit of a bond (each in the other's head) that perpetuates a sort of psychological back-and-forth right up to Bundy's execution date (and perhaps even beyond). There are certainly some well-done and interesting aspects of "No Man of God". The late-80s overall aesthetic is winning, Kirby & Wood have solid on-screen chemistry and give great performances (especially when they are allowed to really let loose), and the first 30-or-so minutes hold great promise in a "where is this going to go?" sort of appeal. Unfortunately, the air is slowly let out of the balloon as the film reaches its middle and then climax, suffocating under the weight of a number of problems... -There's no context given to Bundy whatsoever. If you don't know anything about him, he might as well be "just another serial killer bad guy". Thus, when the film uses real historical footage to try to hit home how big of a deal his case was in the 80s, that lack of information about him sort of undercuts the message. -The movie doesn't really stand for anything, or have a coherent theme. Is it about the FBI's profiling division? Bundy's psyche? Hagmaier's progress where other G-men before him failed? Throughout, the filmmakers try to connect some dots on the concepts of the thin line between madness & sanity, but in the end I was left feeling more along the lines of "what did it all mean?", and not in the good/mysterious way. Finally, simply put: this entire "FBI profiler interviewing serial concept" was perfected by the "Mindhunter" series, which does it to far greater effect than anything seen here. Many overlapping concepts, but that series created the atmospheric tension, context, and character-building that "No Man of God" severely lacks. So, while not ever completely turned off during the viewing experience, my enjoyment waned pretty much from beginning to end. After the major concepts/conceits are introduced, the execution just doesn't live up to those goals in any appreciable way. helpful•19 4 zkonedog Sep 4, 2021 Details Edit Release date August 27, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site XYZ Films Language English Also known as Звір у його голові Production company Company X See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross worldwide $215,876 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 40 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 2.39:1 Related news Blu-ray/DVD Column: No Man of God, Dreaming Grand Avenue, Lourdes, Sibyl Nov 7ShockYa Blu-ray Review – No Man of God (2021) Oct 25Flickeringmyth Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Mexican Spanish language plot outline for No Man of God (2021)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
