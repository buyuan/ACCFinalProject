The universes of Spider-Man 3 (2007) and Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021) are different from each other. Even if a multiversal crossover occurs in MCU's Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021), it is still uncertain whether any other actors from previous Spider-Man films (apart from the ones already confirmed for No Way Home) will appear in future movies. As for Topher Grace, he hasn't confirmed anything about a Venom return in the future. I guess we'll have to wait and see what happens in No Way Home before coming to a conclusion. Edit Spoilers Edit The FAQ items below may give away important plot points. Will Carnage ever get a spin off film? As Carnage gets eaten by Venom in the movie, chances are slim for a Carnage spin-off. But Sony could plan one if they want, but it may look inconsistent with the narrative.
