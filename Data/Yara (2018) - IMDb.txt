There is something very beautiful in the way the film finds a certain innocence lost in our approach to cinema, far from technical perfectionism and strict rules of the scenario, without forgetting to leave notes on the socio-political context and the influence exercised by religion. Continuing a heritage that goes back to Flaherty, Abbas Fahdel integrates documentary and fiction in the same layer, and moves between the appeal of Kiarostami's cinema and Bresson's cinematograph, and refines both styles to obtain a different one, very personal. helpful•6 1 lupinoida Oct 22, 2018 Details Edit Release date May 30, 2019 (Lebanon) Countries of origin Lebanon Iraq France Official site Official Facebook Language Arabic Also known as Γιάρα Filming locations Lebanon Production company Stalker Production ( See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 41 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Love in Fractured Times: New Films Speak to the Power of Memory as a Means of Survival Aug 19Indiewire Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Yara (2018) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
