The first half follows a group of recruits in boot camp under the command of the punishing Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. The second half shows one of those recruits, Joker, covering the war as a correspondent for Stars and Stripes, focusing on the Tet offensive. —Scott Renshaw <as.idc@forsythe.stanford.edu> militaryvietnam wardrill instructoru.s. marineboot camp251 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines An Epic Story of the Vietnam War [Australia Theatrical] Genres Drama War Certificate R Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia In the first part of the movie, in the sequences inside the barracks during the drill, a special lens was designed to keep every single Recruit in focus. Director Stanley Kubrick intended that no one was special and they all had the same treatment. Goofs At the conclusion of the Colonel's questioning of Joker in front of the mass grave, the Colonel salutes Joker. Apart from being improper for an officer to salute an enlisted man, salutes are not rendered in a combat operations area, due to snipers actively seeking officers as targets. Also, when the Colonel says to "answer the question or you'll be standing tall before the man", Joker is, in fact. "standing tall before the man" at that moment. Quotes Gunnery Sergeant Hartman: I bet you're the kind of guy that would fuck a person in the ass and not even have the goddamn common courtesy to give him a reach-around. I'll be watching you. Crazy credits End credits list a song performed by Sam the Sham and The Pharaohs, misspelling the last word as "Pharoahs." This has not been corrected on any home video version of the movie. Alternate versions Originally the song Paint it Black played at a higher speed and higher pitch during the end credits but starting with the 2001 DVD re-release, whenever the movie was remixed to 5.1 (from mono) it was "corrected" to where it plays at the regular speed and pitch instead. Connections Edited into Commercial Entertainment Product (1992) Soundtracks Hello Vietnam Written by Tom T. Hall Performed by Johnny Wright Courtesy of MCA Records User reviews907 Review Top review 8/10 Fascinating Despite Come-Down The first half of "Full Metal Jacket" is so intensely entertaining that director Stanley Kubrick can be forgiven for the slight come-down that follows. The opening scenes draw us into the strict world of "maggots" training to join the ranks of real men, otherwise known as Marines. We see the characters humiliated, yelled at like children, beaten and, in one tragic case, broken down. It's an unpleasant yet fascinating place to visit from the comfort and safety of our living room couches. Yet once the action shifts to the Vietnam War, when you would expect even better, something is lost. The characters seem less real and the atmosphere less intriguing. Overall, however, there aren't many faults to find with this effort, but be forewarned that it's certainly not for younger viewers. helpful•19 4 ReelCheese Jul 18, 2006 FAQ16 What did Joker mean when he said that Leonard was a "Section 8"?
