The angry, grief-riddled woman tries to heal while rejecting anyone who tries to help her, but Fleabag continues to keep up her bravado through it all.

Connections Featured in The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon: Kevin Hart/Phoebe Waller-Bridge/James Bay (2016) Soundtracks Boys Wanna Be Her (uncredited) Written by Peaches Performed by Peaches User reviews587 Review Top review 10/10 Over the Top Funny I've rarely seen anything this funny, and there it is....half an hour of non-stop laughter. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is hysterical as she constantly shares both her innermost and her totally superficial feelings with the audience, even while she's having sex. She is totally bizarre, as are the entire supporting cast, and they won't allow you to stop laughing. If they can keep up the energy levels of the first two episodes, they will have a major hit on their hands. I had such a good time watching this, and I can't wait for the next episode. Don't pass this by. It's one of the best shows TV has to offer. Enjoy! helpful•136 61 yossarian100 Sep 9, 2016 FAQ2 Will there be another season (third)? What is Fleabag's actual name?
