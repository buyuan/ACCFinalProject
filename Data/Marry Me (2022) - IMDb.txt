The Man from Toronto Bullet Train Nope Blood Ties The Cipher The Mother Storyline Edit Kat Valdez is half of the sexiest celebrity power couple on Earth with hot new music supernova Bastian. As Kat and Bastian's inescapable hit single, "Marry Me," climbs the charts, they are about to be wed before an audience of their fans in a ceremony that will stream across multiple platforms. Divorced high-school math teacher Charlie Gilbert has been dragged to the concert by his daughter Lou and his best friend Parker Debbs. When Kat learns, seconds before the ceremony, that Bastian has cheated on her with her assistant, her life turns left as she has a meltdown on stage, questioning love, truth, and loyalty. As her gossamer world falls away, she locks eyes with a stranger-a face in the crowd. If what you know lets you down, then perhaps what you don't know is the answer, and so, in a moment of inspired insanity, Kat chooses to marry Charlie. What begins as an impulsive reaction evolves into an unexpected romance. But as forces conspire to separate them, the universal question arises: Can two people from such different worlds bridge the gulf between them and build a place where they both belong? —jesusblack-91294 wedding Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Comedy Music Romance Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for some language and suggestive material Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia This will be the first time ever that Colombian star Maluma is going to be acting Details Edit Release date February 11, 2022 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Official Facebook Official Instagram Language English Also known as Vezmi si ma Production companies Kung Fu Monkey Productions Nuyorican Productions Perfect World Pictures See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 52 minutes Color Color Related news The Countdown For Maluma and J Lo's Rom-Com Is On!
