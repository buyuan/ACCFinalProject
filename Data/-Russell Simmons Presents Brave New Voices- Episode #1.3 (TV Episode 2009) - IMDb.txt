Ann Arbor poets Aimee, Carolyn and Fiona practice a three-part poem and share some emotional personal stories. After the Philadelphia team takes part in a blindfolded Trust Walk, one of its leaders, Josh, delivers an emotional Fathers Day poem to his dad, who put his own ambitions on hold to support his family. In Santa Fe, NM we meet April, who channels her Navaho background into poems recited with her team from the top of a mountain. Back in Ft. Lauderdale, Jasmine's recurring health problems make it increasingly hard for her to compete, while the team's talented #2 poet, Jon, struggles with a bipolar disorder that could end up making him a team liability.
