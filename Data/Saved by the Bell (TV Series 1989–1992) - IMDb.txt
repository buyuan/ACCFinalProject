Off screen, Mario Lopez and Mark-Paul Gosselaar were (and continue to be) very close friends. The writers, sensing their obvious chemistry, had the characters re-written as best friends, and they remained that way for the rest of the show.

Connections Edited into Saved by the Bell: Wedding in Las Vegas (1994) Soundtracks Go For It by Hot Sundae User reviews161 Review Top review 7/10 Definitely makes the grade Saved By The Bell was one of the best shows that ever aired on Saturday mornings. Ok so it wasn't a show full of Emmy quality performances, but it was a show that was an escape from the everyday pressure that school has on its students. Saved By The Bell centers on a group of friends and their ups and downs through high school. Filled with memorable moments and interesting characters, SBTB is one of the best young adult programs of its time. It has stood the test of time and still remains a popular program. I think it was a show made for the sure purpose of entertaining its young audience for a half an hour. There are a lot of episodes that were pretty amusing. Never again will a generation make such a connection as the one mine did with SBTB, the series starred Mark Paul Gosselaar as Zack Morris, the main character who each week spun in and out of several pretty extreme situation. His main squeeze Kelly Kapowski played by Tiffani-Amber Thiessen, and the most popular geek Screech, played by Dustin Diamond. Also along for the ride were Slater, Jessie, and Lisa, who made up the rest of the gang. I don't think that it was ever aimed to break the barriers of great television it was what it was. Sure the series made high school look like a piece of cake, for example being able to go to The Max whenever they wanted, taking advantage of the principal, and tricking nerds into doing anything they wanted. But Saved By the Bell was one of those shows that as corny as it may be, it will forever remain one the most entertaining shows in the history of children's entertainment. helpful•38 11 ForReal84 Feb 18, 2004 Details Edit Release date August 20, 1989 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as As the Bell Rings Filming locations Ulysses S.
