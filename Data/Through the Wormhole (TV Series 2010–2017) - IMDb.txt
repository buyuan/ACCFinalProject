What are we made of? What was there before the beginning? Are we really alone? Is there a creator? These questions have been pondered by the most exquisite minds of the human race. Now, science has evolved to the point where hard facts and evidence may be able to provide us with answers instead of philosophical theories. Through the Wormhole will bring together the brightest minds and best ideas from the very edges of science - Astrophysics, Astrobiology, Quantum Mechanics, String Theory, and more - to reveal the extraordinary truth of our Universe. —Anonymous scienceastrophysicsuniverseastronomyouter space43 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genre Documentary Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Connections Featured in Symphony of Science: The Quantum World (2011) User reviews25 Review Top review 7/10 Noble attempt, but hit-and-miss. Too many voices. All series on the topic of astronomy and cosmology must and will be measured to that watershed event of the early eighties, "Cosmos" by Carl Sagan, which left me with clarity of what we knew, and the relevant questions yet to be answered at the time. A magisterial Morgan Freeman guides each episode by asking fascinating and timely questions, then allowing experts to answer them. The result feels too all-over-the-map, sometimes patronizingly simple, then suddenly, as if taken for granted, skipping over crucial logical stepping stones in the explanation process. "Through The Wormhole" suffers from too many people with different verbal styles (and varying verbal skills) to follow a coherent thread of an idea from beginning to end, the way Mr Sagan did so masterfully back in the day. Then there's a certain something Discovery Channel Influence, with episodes titled along the lines of "Is There A God?", which Mr Sagan would have found sensationalistic. And I agree with Mr Sagan. Bottom line: As a passionate follower of astronomy since the early eighties, I watch "Through The Wormhole", but in 2012 I prefer my astrophysics/cosmology shows hosted by Neil DeGrasse Tyson, or Brian Cox. helpful•29 35 niktemadur Jan 28, 2012 Details Edit Release date June 9, 2010 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Science Channel (United States) Language English Also known as Through the Wormhole with Morgan Freeman Filming locations Ventura, California, USA Production companies Discovery Science Channel Revelations Entertainment The Incubator See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news Morgan Freeman, Alfre Woodard, Trevor Jackson, Common & More Set For Revelations’ ‘Hate To See You Go’ Mar 25Deadline Film + TV Revelations Entertainment & Prodigy Pictures Team With Crispr Pioneer George Church For Dramatic Series Mar 17Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the English language plot outline for Through the Wormhole (2010)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
