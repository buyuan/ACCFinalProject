Genre Crime Parents guide Add content advisory User reviews12 Review Top review 1/10 David George Reichert This idiot found a cash cow. The first episode of this series makes him out to be a hero, while really, we all thought he was an idiot. The murders were treated as inconsequential by the police, and the taskforce a taxpayer-paid for joke. helpful•5 7 pugetsdreams Nov 5, 2021 Details Edit Release date December 8, 2020 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Official Trailer Language English Also known as Katil Avcıları Filming locations USA Production company Partners in Motion Inc.
