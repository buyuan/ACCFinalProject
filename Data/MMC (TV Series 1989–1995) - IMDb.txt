Connections Edited into MMC in Concert (1993) User reviews13 Review Top review The best show ever! MMC is my favorite show. I don't know why they do not play the reruns of it. It was very funny. I've heard it be described as a kids version of SNL. It was a show where the teenage actors put on skits and perform songs. This was and is the BEST SHOW EVER!! helpful•2 2 MMC Fan_and_Ryan Gosling lover Apr 5, 2002 Details Edit Release date April 24, 1989 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Official Britney Spears Website Official Christina Aguilera Website Language English Also known as The All New Mickey Mouse Club Filming locations Lake Buena Vista, Florida, USA Production companies Blue Wave Industries Les Chousc Company Steve Clements Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 30 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 1.33 : 1 Related news How ‘Mickey the Brave!’ Art Director Alan Bodner Paid Homage to Disney’s Classic ‘Mouse Club’ Jul 2Variety Film + TV Christina Aguilera Shows Her Support For Britney Spears in a Series of Heartfelt Tweets Jun 29Popsugar.com Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was MMC (1989) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
