Big mouth. Big attitude. But who knew she had a big heart. Genres Crime Drama Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for violence and language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia When asked why he decided to direct this film, Sidney Lumet frankly replied that he liked to work all the time, and if he couldn't find a good script he'd take a fair one. Goofs In the scene where Gloria checks into the hotel, as she takes her shoes off and washes her feet in the bath tub, her shoe is on the floor then it is on the bed. Quotes Nicholas 'Nicky' Nuñez: I like sleeping with you. Gloria: You're not the first guy to tell me that.

User reviews40 Review Top review I refuse to believe that Sidney Lumet directed this. Yeah, I realize what it says under the director's credit. But there is no way in hell that I'm gonna believe that the man that gave us "Network", "Dog Day Afternoon", "Running On Empty", and his own quartet of NYPD dramas ("Serpico", "Prince of the City", "Q&A", and "Night Falls on Manhattan") is even associated with this. This is quite possibly the worst mainstream film of '99, in the cozy company of "Bats", "Virus", "She's All That", and (gasp!) "The Haunting", just to name a few. Where to begin? The script for starters. How the writer managed to completely foul up the original source material is beyond me. Much of everything that comes out of Sharon Stone's mouth is unintentionally funny, especially in one scene where she tells her young companion, "I'm trying to teach you a philosophy of life here!" after telling him opportunities in his future (these include going to a race track, lovemaking, and "chasing a skinny blonde girl with big boobs.") And while on the subject of Stone, it's roles like this that manage to solidify the claim that maybe, just maybe, her brilliant turn in "Casino" was a fluke. Please Sharon, say it ain't so! Like other users have mentioned, the film's only saving grace is the car chase. But there's a lot of tedium to get through until the chase scene comes. Then again, why bother? Avoid. I can't stress this enough. helpful•7 6 Rid.X Mar 11, 2000 Details Edit Release date January 22, 1999 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as 奪命大反擊 Filming locations New York City, New York, USA Production companies Columbia Pictures Eagle Point Production Mandalay Entertainment See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $30,000,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $4,197,729 Opening weekend US & Canada $2,143,089 Jan 24, 1999 Gross worldwide $4,197,729 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 48 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital SDDS Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Top 150 Most Anticipated Foreign Films of 2020: #32.
