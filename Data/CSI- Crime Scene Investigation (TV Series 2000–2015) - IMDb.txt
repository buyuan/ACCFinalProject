Being the second busiest crime lab in America, CSI officers use the best scientific and technical methods to solve puzzles and catch criminals. —ahmetkozan crime scene investigationlas vegas nevadacrime labpolicedetective84 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Sin Never Sleeps Genres Crime Drama Mystery Thriller Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The choice to place this series in Las Vegas was not random. Among U.S. crime labs, Las Vegas is the second most active, surpassed only by the F.B.I. lab in Quantico, Virginia. This fact is stated in Pilot (2000). Goofs "The CSI Effect": CSIs are not detectives as this is exceedingly rare in real life, as they are actually classed as civilian employees. It is considered an inappropriate and improbable practice to allow CSI personnel to be involved in detective work as it would compromise the impartiality of scientific evidence and would be impracticably time-consuming. Quotes Greg Sanders: All work and no play makes Greg a dull boy. Gil Grissom: All play and no work makes Greg an UNEMPLOYED boy. Alternate versions Due to rights issues at the time of release, the R2 (Europe/UK) and R4 (Australia) DVD releases of Season 1 have The Who music replaced by an original theme from John M. Keane. The Who are still credited in the closing credits. Connections Edited into The Real CSI (2004) Soundtracks Who Are You (uncredited) Written by Pete Townshend Performed by The Who User reviews261 Review Top review Outstanding!!! C.S.I. is the best new show of the 2000 season! William L. Petersen is the coolest of the cool as Gil Grissom. I've followed his career since I first saw him in To Live and Die in L.A. He's an amazing actor and he heads up a cast of amazing actors as well. This show really keeps you on the edge of your seat as the investigators literally take a crime scene that appears to leave them with nothing to go on. The investigators take nothing and turn it into something amazing as each crime is solved right in front of you and you as the viewer, never see it coming! Wow! I hope this is one show CBS will pick up year after year! helpful•106 27 kidcurry1967 Dec 7, 2000 FAQ4 How realistic is the TV CSI's compared to there real world counterparts? Can the police really lie to you? Do the police always need a search warrant?
