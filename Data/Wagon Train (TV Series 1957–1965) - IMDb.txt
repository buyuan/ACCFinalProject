The first treks were led by gruff, but good-at-heart Major Seth Adams, backed up by his competent frontier scout, Flint McCullough. After Adams and McCullough, the wagon train was led by the avuncular Christopher Hale, along with new scouts Duke Shannon and Cooper Smith. Many stories featured the trustworthy Assistant Wagonmaster Bill Hawks, grizzled old cook Charlie Wooster, and a young orphan, Barnaby West. —Doug Sederberg <vornoff@sonic.net> trainwagonsioux indianpawnee indianbuffalo13 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genre Western Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia Ward Bond (Major Seth Adams) and Robert Horton (Flint McCullough) did not get along on the set. According to Horton, Bond spread rumors about his sexuality. The two men settled their differences two days before Bond died. Goofs Often, when people are aboard the wagons conversing, the back projection of the scenery passing appears to have been shot at thirty miles per hour or more, which would be a velocity rarely approached by a covered wagon. Connections Featured in TV's Western Heroes (1993) Soundtracks Wagon Train Written by Henri Rene and Bob Russell (Season 1 only) User reviews20 Review Top review 7/10 Too many seasons, should have quit after Season 6. The cast member who left and was most missed was Robert Horton. I didn't miss Ward Bond, who was never leading man caliber and already burned out by the time he began this series. But it was increasingly poor writing that eventually doomed the series. Season 8 was especially bad (except for the memorable "Herman" episode), and the series mercifully ended after just 26 episodes. It seems like John McIntire decided to exit earlier than that, as he wasn't even featured in several of the last episodes. Instead, Frank McGrath, who had spent his career as a Stunt Man before this series, seemed to have more screen time than anyone else. The writing became so uninspired that they resorted to "flashback" plots, the supernatural (2 episodes), and one that included the Earps. McGrath was the only series "Regular" in the final episode, and then only as a supporting character. helpful•2 0 mts43 Jul 7, 2020 FAQ2 Were there some color episodes of Wagon Train?
