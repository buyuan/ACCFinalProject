Genre Comedy Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia In the first season, Zooey Deschanel (Jess) and Jake Johnson (Nick) were directed to have as little physical contact as possible. This is because their chemistry was thought to be too distracting. Goofs The abstract(ish) painting next to the loft's front door changes orientation. Quotes Jess: [to Nick] I brought something from school that reminds me of you. [pulls out a stick] Jess: It's a feeling stick. Whoever is holding the feeling stick has permission to say whatever he or she is feeling without being judged. I'll go first. Um, I feel like I want to know what you're feeling. Nick Miller: [walks over and breaks the stick] Jess: Believe it or not, that is not the first time someone has broken my feeling stick. [pulls out another stick] Jess: I have a travel size. Connections Featured in The Tonight Show with Jay Leno: Episode #20.18 (2011) Soundtracks Hey Girl (Theme Song) Music by Michael Andrews and Zooey Deschanel Lyrics by Elizabeth Meriwether, Dave Finkel and Brett Baer Performed by Zooey Deschanel User reviews351 Review Top review 8/10 Genuine Comedy from a US TV Show New Girl is received a whole lot better than a lot of other US TV shows due to the lack of a laugh track. You're not directed as to when you should find something funny, it is just an easy watch to enjoy throughout. The quality fluctuates across the series but overall it ticks all the boxes for a sitcom, and Winston will easily become your favourite character by the end. helpful•5 0 deepfrieddodo Aug 29, 2020 FAQ1 Was this series always called "New Girl"?
