Genres Animation Action Adventure Comedy Family Fantasy Certificate TV-Y Parents guide Did you know Edit Connections Featured in WatchMojo: Top 10 Animated Series Based on Video Games (2015) User reviews2 Review Top review 10/10 Angry Birds Toons I think Angry Birds Toons has some lame episodes but at least it's good. This is because Angry Birds Toons have most violent episodes, not very violent but interesting. As says on Wikipedia, the episodes are getting interesting. It's interesting, some violence but a good cartoon series for children. Not very funny but worth the while of watching. For all ages maybe. The quality which gotten better I really like the most because you can see what the characters are doing in full HD content. There are plans for Rovio company that a season 2 is coming out. I hope their are more violence, maybe fighting but no silliness on it which I don't like helpful•12 8 leetumchayo Feb 6, 2014 Details Edit Release date March 17, 2013 (Finland) Countries of origin Finland United Kingdom United States Official sites Netflix Official site Language None Also known as Сердиті пташки Production companies Atomic Cartoons Rovio Entertainment Sony Pictures Television See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 3 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 1.78 : 1 16:9 HD Related news ‘Angry Birds: Summer Madness’ Series Coming to Netflix in 2021 Mar 25Indiewire First Longform ‘Angry Birds’ Series in the Works (Exclusive) Oct 13Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Angry Birds Toons (2013) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
