Long Time Dead tries to recify this with mixed results. Though not brilliant and lacking a lot of the audicity of the Hammer films, as well as the eerie spookiness of the lastets supernatural hits - THE OTHERS and SIXTH SENSE, Long Time Dead does manage a few tense moments - nothing overly scarey mind you but I didn't hate it. The trouble is it is trying to follow an American formula - a group of teenagers fooling around with the supernatural unleash something terrible and most of them die as a result. It also has the now mandatory - "it's not really over" ending. That said it is okay and fans thirsty for a bit of spooky old fashioned horror/supernatural/teenage thriller will probably enjoy it. Just as an aside I recommend viewers who did enjoy this or who are interested in the Demon DJIN which features in this film would enjoy WishMaster - the Wes Craven film. It is far more bloody and violent but the Djin is also much more developed. helpful•12 11 vampiresan Sep 17, 2002 Details Edit Release date January 18, 2002 (United Kingdom) Countries of origin United Kingdom France United States Language English Also known as La ouija: El juego de los espíritus Filming locations London, England, UK Production companies Working Title Films Film Council WT2 Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross worldwide $22,667,193 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 34 minutes Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Madalina Ghenea & Ed Westwick Starring In Shark Survival Thriller ‘Deep Fear’ Nov 17Deadline Film + TV Ed Westwick, Madalina Ghenea to Star in Shark Survival Thriller ‘Deep Fear’ Nov 17Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Long Time Dead (2002) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
