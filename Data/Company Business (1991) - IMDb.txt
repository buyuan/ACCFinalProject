Genres Action Comedy Crime Drama Thriller Certificate PG-13 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Mikhail Baryshnikov hated this movie so much that he refused to do publicity for it. Goofs When Mikhail and Gene are walking through the forest, they walk toward the camera which moves backwards in sync with them. At one point, the camera crew bumps some branches of a fir tree, which are seen to snap into the frame before the actors reach the tree. Quotes [About East German car.] Sam Boyd: Is it alarmed? Pyiotr Grushenko: Only if you frighten it.

That's what I thought I'd done with Company Business as I'd been browsing through the Blockbuster and couldn't remember the film at all, despite being a Baryshnikov fan. I figured what the heck and rented it anyway. I was quite surprised to find myself really enjoying this film even though you sometimes have to really work at suspending your disbelief. I'm still trying to figure out how exactly Baryshnikov could have been successful as a mole with his accent. This film has two things really working for it though -- the dialogue and the stars. The dialogue is wonderful. Throughout the movie there are great one line bits that leave you chuckling. Mind you, most of those lines wouldn't have worked if Hackman and Baryshnikov hadn't had such great chemistry. You really don't watch this film for the plot, but for the interaction between these two. It certainly wasn't a pairing I expected, but it worked. With all that said, my one complaint about the movie has nothing to do with whether or not it was a believable plot, but where it left off. I wanted more resolution. My husband agrees. We got to the end of the film and he looked at me and said "That's it? It was just getting good." It leaves too many things up in the air. All in all, I would say if you are expecting a spy movie, don't bother. If, on the other hand, you want a fun little buddy movie, rent it and enjoy. helpful•7 5 aegm May 30, 2000 Details Edit Release date September 6, 1991 (United States) Country of origin United States Languages English Russian French Also known as Dinosaurs Filming locations Restaurant Le Jules Verne, Eiffel Tower, Paris, France Production company Pathé Entertainment See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $18,000,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $1,501,785 Opening weekend US & Canada $533,610 Sep 8, 1991 Gross worldwide $1,501,785 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 38 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Stereo Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news HBO Max New Releases: November 2021 Nov 1Den of Geek New on HBO Max in November 2021 Oct 25Gold Derby Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Company Business (1991) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
