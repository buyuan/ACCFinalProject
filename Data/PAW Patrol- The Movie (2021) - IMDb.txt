Quotes Gus: A dog? Chase: Actually, sir, I'm a puppy. Gus: A baby dog! That's even worse! Chase: You're in shock, so I'm not going to take that personally. Now, let's get you out of this truck to safety. Gus: No way! I'm waiting for a real rescue! [the truck shakes] Gus: I changed my mind! Let's go! Connections Featured in AniMat's Crazy Cartoon Cast: Talkin' Trailers (2021) Soundtracks Southern Fried Written by Rob Szabo (as Rob Szado) User reviews105 Review Top review 9/10 A new beginning for Paw patrol To A lot of people paw patrol is a kid show. But after watching this movie... I feel like I am a new fan of them. As an animation lover, the way they animated the pups are simply too adorable to resist. Story line isn't bad either. Following the kids show premise, with character back story and development in it. You get a full movie. I m 24. And I cried. A few times... One of the character goes through something that I understand deeply. And every time I see it... every time I cry. This movie will remind you that even the big and strong can be mentally hurt. And that it doesn't mean they are weak. helpful•28 5 terryajoseph Aug 13, 2021 Details Edit Release date August 20, 2021 (Canada) Countries of origin Canada United States Official sites About Minorities Report Film [Kolby Mac] Official site Language English Also known as 汪汪队立大功大电影 Filming locations Toronto, Ontario, Canada Production companies Spin Master Entertainment Paramount Pictures Nickelodeon Movies See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $26,000,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $40,127,371 Opening weekend US & Canada $13,148,340 Aug 22, 2021 Gross worldwide $130,127,371 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 26 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Dolby Atmos Aspect ratio 2.39 : 1 Related news Box Office: ‘Clifford the Big Red Dog’ Fetches $2.3M on Opening Day Nov 11The Hollywood Reporter - Film + TV Amid ‘Eternals’ Dominance Of The Box Office, ‘Clifford The Big Red Dog’ Hopes To Leave Paw Print – Preview Nov 10Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
