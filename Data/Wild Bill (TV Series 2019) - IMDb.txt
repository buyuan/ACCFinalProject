Viewing figures dropped from 5.7 million for episode 1 to 3.2 million by episode 6 and the series received mixed reviews from critics and viewers. In addition, the series struggled to find a U.S. broadcaster. Goofs Bill Hixon is seen wearing four individual medal ribbons on his uniform - these are, from right to left, the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal, Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal, Queen's Police Medal for Distinguished Service, and Police Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. These are all medals that are awarded to UK police officers, for which Hixon would not be eligible having not served in any UK police force prior to his appointment. User reviews148 Review Top review 7/10 Sit back, feet up and have a break from reality What to say first.......well there's been better but there's certainly been a lot worse. Casting Rob Lowe was good move, his dry humour carries the show and has delivered some good one liners. Rob Lowe's take on our policing is very humorous as he questions how things are done differently here. Yes there are some flaws and questionable plots so far but so do other fictional crime/comedy series. I could name quite a few other comedies based round a local police station were the constables undermine and talk inappropriately to higher ranking officers and unbelievable plots told. At the end of the day, it is fictional and a black comedy with made up plots and not a serious drama which I think some have forgotten. I have rated this series an 7 with the hope that as it progresses the humour will increase. helpful•42 4 kymlou67 Jun 26, 2019 Details Edit Release date June 12, 2019 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Language English Also known as Дикий Билл Filming locations Lincolnshire, England, UK Production companies 42 Anonymous Content Shiver See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Color Color Sound mix Stereo Related news New on Netflix UK April 2021: Shadow and Bone, Thunder Force, The Mitchells Vs the Machines & More!
