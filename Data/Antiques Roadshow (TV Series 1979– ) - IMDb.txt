Connections Featured in TV Hell (1992) User reviews5 Review Top review 5/10 Some interesting items, creepy appraisers Some treasures are sometimes uncovered wich is an education in itself. However some of the appraisers give me the creeps. The guy with the horrible teeth and the guy with the dirty long fingernails to name a couple. There also seem some envy and desire to own some of the objects by other appraisers. On a happier note i do like the host, she is intellegent, articulate and often fun. The values often are all over the place; take them with a grain of salt. helpful•2 1 louispeter-23057 Jul 17, 2020 Details Edit Release date February 18, 1979 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Official site Official Site Language English Also known as Engelska antikrundan Filming locations Alnwick Castle, Alnwick, Northumberland, England, UK Production company British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 45 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 1.33 : 1 Related news The Morning Watch: Incredibles 2 Animation Progression, Ryan Reynolds Does Antiques Roadshow & More Nov 17Slash Film ‘Home Sweet Home Alone’ Review: This Grinchy Sequel Wastes Big Comedic Talent and Minor Holiday Cheer Nov 11Indiewire Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Antiques Roadshow (1979) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
