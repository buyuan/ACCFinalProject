Genre Drama Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG for momentary nudity, and some language in a family drama Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Brad Pitt trained himself to fly-fish for four weeks prior to shooting. Since he was not near any river in Los Angeles, he trained on top of a building. Goofs While on the library steps, Norman speaks of meeting boxer John L. Sullivan while at Dartmouth. Norman's departure for college was 1919, yet Sullivan died in 1918. Quotes Rev. Maclean: Each one of us here today will at one time in our lives look upon a loved one who is in need and ask the same question: We are willing help, Lord, but what, if anything, is needed? For it is true, we can seldom help those closest to us. Either we don't know what part of ourselves to give or, more often than not, the part we have to give is not wanted. And so it those we live with and should know who elude us. But we can still love them - we can love completely without complete understanding. Crazy credits No fish were killed or injured during the making of A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT. The producers would like to point out that, although the Macleans kept their catch as was common earlier in this century, enlightened fisherman today endorse a "catch and release" policy to assure that this priceless resource swims free to fight another day. Good fishing. Alternate versions The US DVD has different composer credits for the widescreen/pan & scan version. The widescreen version lists Elmer Bernstein (whose score was rejected) while the pan & scan version lists 'Mark Isham' (who replaced Bernstein).

User reviews168 Review Top review 8/10 Very Deep Heart Searching Film Enjoyed this film produced by Robert Redford which deals with a Presbyterian Minister who has two sons, one is reserved and the other is a hell raiser. This film takes place in Montana and the beauty of their rivers and wonderful land and its beautiful mountains. Tom Skeritt, (Rev. MacLean) plays the role of a very loving parent of Norman MacLean, (Craig Sheffer) who is basically a very straight arrow and also his brother Paul MacLean, (Brad Pitt) who is a newspaper reporter and has a very wild way living especially with drinking and plenty of women. There is a sweet romance between Norman MacLean and Jessie Burns, (Emily Lloyd) who fall in love with each other and these two people try to guide Paul MacLean into a better way of living but he just cannot seem to settle down. Great film about what life is really about in many families.
