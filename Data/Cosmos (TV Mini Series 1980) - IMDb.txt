Dr. Sagan describes the universe in a way that appeals to a mass audience, by using Earth as a reference point, by speaking in terms intelligible to non-scientific people, by relating the exploration of space to that of the Earth by pioneers of old, and by citing such Earth legends as the Library of Alexandria as metaphors for space-related future events. Among Dr. Sagan's favorite topics are the origins of life, the search for life on Mars, the infernal composition of the atmosphere of Venus and a warning about a similar effect taking place on Earth due to global pollution and the "greenhouse effect", the lives of stars, interstellar travel and the effects of attaining the speed of light, the danger of mankind technologically self-destructing, and the search, using radio technology, for intelligent life in deep space. —Kevin McCorry <mmccorry@nb.sympatico.ca> scientific philosophylightyeareducationalunidentified flying objectvenus111 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genre Documentary Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia The series featured the most extensive use of special effects ever conducted for a documentary. In one notable episode, special effects were used to make it seem as if host Sagan was walking through a model recreation of the Library of Alexandria. Quotes Carl Sagan: The cosmos is also within us, we're made of star-stuff. We are a way for the cosmos, to know itself. Alternate versions For video release in the mid-1980s, an additional episode of this series was created, consisting of a one-on-one interview between Carl Sagan and media mogul Ted Turner, discussing the themes of the series. Connections Featured in Miracle Mile (1988) User reviews62 Review Top review 10/10 The best way to be introduced to science! Carl Sagan had a way with words. He had a way of making the complex simple. As a young teenager growing up with an interest in science this was an excellent way to begin. This is one of those must see programs. The music by Vangelis was also fantastic. This ignited (excuse the pun) my interest in science and Vangelis' music which is as keen now as when I first saw and heard it. Excellent! helpful•43 3 tcooke-2 Jan 24, 2000 Details Edit Release date September 28, 1980 (United States) Countries of origin United States United Kingdom Also known as Cosmos: A Personal Voyage Filming locations Calcutta, West Bengal, India Production companies KCET Carl Sagan Productions British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 13 hours Related news A Tribute to Carl Sagan: The Wonderful Mystic, Where Brains Meet Entertainment Jun 29Hollywood Insider - Substance & Meaningful Entertainment ‘Cosmos: Creating Possible Worlds’ boldly goes for Emmy by taking viewers on ‘roller coaster through the universe’ [Watch] Aug 17Gold Derby Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the French language plot outline for Cosmos (1980)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
