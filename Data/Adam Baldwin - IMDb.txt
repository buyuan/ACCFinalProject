Personal Quote: What I try to do is to appreciate every job I have while I'm working on it. [Stanley] Kubrick taught me that on Full Metal Jacket. He said I wasn't patient enough. We were a bunch of cocky young actors. "We're in a Kubrick film! We've made it!" Big arrogant fat-headed idiots in green fatigues. I'll always reflect back on that. He showed me you should appreciate what you have while you have it. See more » Trivia: Alumnus of New Trier Township High School East, Winnetka, Illinois.
