Great history lesson! Ethnic diversity is such a big part of Istanbul and Turkey afcourse. To bad things happened the way they did. The turkisch spoken with al the (for me) old and unfamiliar words...great. I hope there will be alot more episodes of this show I cant wait. helpful•2 0 yurdadogru Nov 14, 2021 Details Edit Release date November 5, 2021 (Turkey) Country of origin Turkey Official site Official Site Language Turkish Also known as The Club Filming locations Istanbul, Turkey Production company O3 Turkey Medya See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 55 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 1.78 : 1 / (high definition) Related news Netflix Teams with Fabula for Streamers Second Chilean Original – Global Bulletin Nov 9Variety Film + TV New on Netflix: November 2021 Releases Nov 1Den of Geek Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Italian language plot outline for Kulüp (2021)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
