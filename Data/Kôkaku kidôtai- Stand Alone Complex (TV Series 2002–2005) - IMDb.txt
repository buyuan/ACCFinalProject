The entire team returns to the front lines: Kusanagi, Batoh, Togusa, Ishikawa, Saito, Paz & Borma, with four of the original Tachikomas restored after the firefight of Episode 26. The hostage situation announced the rising of a new terrorist cell, which takes much after another one in the headlines of today's papers. The Individual Eleven, whose members are neither individuals, or total up to eleven are a new threat to Public Security. How does a specialized public security group face an enemy more faceless than the "laughing man" during a time of political unrest? Among the broad changes from the first show involve the new ruling party, headed by the new Prime Minister Kabayuki after the prior ousting in GITS: SAC, the Japanese Residents caught in the middle of the affairs and paying the taxes for jobs they're going to lose in a time of recession, and the downtrodden "invited" Asian Immigrants of the Second Vietnamese War who were brought to Japan as a half-hearted humanitarian act from the government who was really just seeking cheap labor. And just who is the man called "Gohda", a mysterious new 'supervisor' (don't worry, Aramaki still runs the group) who appears to be calling the shots for Section 9 during certain missions? He calls out orders as if he was in charge of the group, yet has no apparent loyalty or respect to the government, military or Section 9. —nachothecheesyone artificial intelligenceanimesexy womanmindgynoid57 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines A New Beginning, A New Threat... Genres Animation Action Crime Sci-Fi Thriller Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia There are two sources for the title of the show. The first is the text at the beginning of the first episode, where it describes the psychology of some of those without cybernetic implants. Essentially, they have a "Stand Alone Complex"; they feel that they "stand alone" from the rest of humanity who have cybernetic implants, which allow those with them to communicate at any time with anyone who also has implants. The second source is a reference to the story itself. The term is used to describe an event where multiple people who have no associations with each other and are not part of a common group(thus they "stand alone"), through similar actions, seem to work together towards a common goal. This "complex" is referenced a number of times in the story, mainly about the laughing man case, but also in reference to a few other cases the group encounters. Quotes Major Motoko Kusanagi: Look at the bright side, if this doesn't work, we can all go drown our sorrows at a nudie bar. Connections Edited into Kôkaku kidôtai: Stand alone complex - The laughing man (2005) Soundtracks Inner Universe (opening theme - 1st season) Performed by Origa featuring Ben Del Maestro Music by Yôko Kanno Lyrics by Origa and Shanti Snyder User reviews41 Review Top review 10/10 Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex (Season 1) This is a beautifully animated series format derived from the characters of the philosophically oriented movie 'Ghost in the Shell'. The animation is closer to the original concepts for the manga and adds amazingly gorgeous music to produce a show that is an instant draw. The characters draw some of the aspects familiar in the movie... Motoko's commitment to her job, Batou's casual-tough guy attitude, etc... though it adds some surprisingly refreshing characters like the blue child-like mini tanks Section 9 rides around in so much. The same philosophical elements of the movie -consciousness in a cyber-oriented world- are present, but definitely take a back seat to plots focused on political wranglings, terrorism, and general lawlessness. The series seems to be more "all in a days work" themed than the cerebral current of the first film. Overall I highly recommend this series to all fans, though hope they watch the movies as well. helpful•21 2 SoulfulFX Sep 28, 2007 FAQ2 What is the connection between this show and the two movies?
