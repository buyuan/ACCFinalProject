But the producers had Stanford researchers actually develop a legitimate equation that is slowly gaining traction in the research community. Quotes Donald 'Jared' Dunn: Hey! Sorry if I scared you, I know I have somewhat ghost-like features. My uncle used to say, "You look like someone starved a virgin to death."

That said, until now, not once have I felt the need to type up a review. Silicon Valley if possibly the funniest show I have seen, ever. The writing is thoughtful, with perfect comedic timing. The only word to describe the characters is awesome. They all work so well together that the comedy flows effortlessly. I am surprised to see that this show is coming from HBO. I would expect a show like this from Netflix but not HBO. But I must commend them because they hit this one out the park. I look forward to what I hope will be a long lasting series with many more seasons to come. You can see from my profile that I have been a member here for many years and have not ever written a single review, so you can be assured that what I say is true. If you haven't seen Silicon Valley you are missing out. Go check it out! helpful•246 26 santacruzlocal May 11, 2014 FAQ1 How accurate is Silicon Valley?
