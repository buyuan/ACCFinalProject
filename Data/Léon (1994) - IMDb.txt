S. Golden hitmangirlteenage girlloss of familyneo noir268 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines If you want the job done right, hire a professional. Genres Action Crime Drama Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for scenes of strong graphic violence, and for language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia According to Jean Reno, he decided to play Léon as if he were "a little mentally slow" and emotionally repressed. He felt that this would make audiences relax and realize that he wasn't someone who would take advantage of a vulnerable young girl. Reno claims that for Léon, the possibility of a physical relationship with Mathilda is not even conceivable, and as such, during the scenes when such a relationship is discussed, Reno very much allowed Portman to be emotionally in control of the scenes. Goofs Many viewers believe that Stansfield never saw Leon, and therefore could not recognize him at the end, but they fail to remember that Stansfield visited Tony at the restaurant after Leon had killed part of Stansfield's crew. Thus, being intimidated and threatened by Stansfield, it must be presumed that Tony gave him a complete description of Leon, and very possibly a photograph. Quotes Mathilda: I don't wanna lose you, Leon. Léon: You're not going to lose me. You've given me a taste for life. I wanna be happy. Sleep in a bed, have roots. And you'll never be alone again, Mathilda. Please, go now, baby, go. Calm down, I'll meet you at Tony's in an hour, I love you, now go, go now. Crazy credits Under the "SPECIAL THANKS" heading you will find: Chevalier KAMEN (Prince of the Mash Potatoes) Byblos Bill (King of Saint Tropez) Princess Trudy (Queen of Hearts) Alternate versions In the original version there is a shot of Tony's place at night just before Stansfield and his men come in on the birthday party. This isn't in the 'Version integrale' (International Cut).
