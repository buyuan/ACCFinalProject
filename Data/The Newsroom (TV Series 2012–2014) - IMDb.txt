They take real, newsworthy events from our world as they're happening (such as bin Laden's justified killing, NSA spying, etc) and report on them as if they were an actual news station that followed rational and moral guidelines, in a biting criticism of our popular press and a clever blurring of art and reality. —Guy T newsroomethicstelevision producernews reportingtv news21 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines More on this story as it develops. Genre Drama Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Sloan Sabbith, played by actress Olivia Munn, is fluent in Japanese. Munn is actually fluent in Japanese, as she spent her childhood living in Tokyo, Tokyo Metropolis, Japan, and graduated college with a minor in Japanese. Goofs The very beginning of the title sequence shows the Soviet Sputnik flying with its antennas oriented away from the Earth. The Sputnik rotated, which is why that design of antenna array was chosen as it allows equal transmission of radio signals in all directions. Connections Featured in Chelsea Lately: Episode #6.114 (2012) Soundtracks The Newsroom Main Theme Written by Thomas Newman User reviews342 Review Top review 9/10 Fascinating Examination of Journalistic Ethics Juxtaposed with Witty Writing! I had attempted to watch the West Wing, but found it to be too dated. Newsroom was my second attempt to watch an Aaron Sorkin show. I absolutely fell in love with some of the characters, most notably Will McAvoy and Jim Harper. The writing is absolutely brilliant. The dialogue is very witty and creates some fun situations. There are several comedic moments in the show while balancing massive news stories such as Deepwater Horizon or the assassination of OBL. What I love most is how often Don Quixote comes into play through dialogue. The premise of the show is to report the news the correct way, not through calling attention to reality TV stars or a celebrity feud. Don Quixote and his mission to civilize is a frequent presence of the show. I identify far too much with Will McAvoy. Will is fiercely loyal, protective and can be a bit of an ass. Will was fine reporting stories that were not necessarily newsworthy until his former flame MacKenzie McHale (Emily Mortimer) arrives as the new EP for his show. Mac forces and encourages him to report the actual news to the public. Will takes it upon himself to educate viewers, but also gossip columnists and others who he deems do not know the actual news. The relationship between Mac and Will is one of the series best. Romance is a huge part of the show. There is a love between Will and Mac for the entirety of the series. I love Jim Harper (Josh Gallagher Jr.) though. He is kind, dorky and has the greatest bromance with Neal Sampat (Dev Patel). He also has a crush on fellow coworker Maggie Jordan (Alison Pill) and their chemistry is amazing. Lastly, I was shocked to find the number of terrible reviews from numerous media outlets. The show does hope to change the way Americans view the news. The news does frequently mention the latest celebrity scandal and does not educate. The series hopes to fill that void. I believe that The NY Times, LA Times and others felt threatened by exposing the inner workings of a news station. I loved the show because it shows the idiocy of politicians, governmental mistakes and other key issues. Although, if you are conservative I do advise against watching the show. I was very sad watching the series finale. I felt very close to some of the characters which is not something that happens to me very often. The series ends beautifully and I feel the series is so important as a whole. I wish the show was still continuing in the age of fake news, but I am thankful it was on for as long as it was. I found myself laughing, deep in thought and learning. I definitely recommend this!!! helpful•9 0 henryshear Apr 4, 2020 FAQ2 How did Aaron Sorkin research for this series?
