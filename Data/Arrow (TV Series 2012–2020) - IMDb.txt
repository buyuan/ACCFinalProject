His father dies, but Oliver survives for five years on an uncharted island and eventually returns home. But he wasn't alone on the island where he learned not only how to fight and survive but also of his father's corruption and unscrupulous business dealings. He returns to civilization a changed man, determined to put things right. He disguises himself with the hood of one of his mysterious island mentors, arms himself with a bow and sets about hunting down the men and women who have corrupted his city. —Anonymous superherobased on comic bookarcherdc comicscrime fighter66 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Destiny leaves its mark (Season 1) Genres Action Adventure Crime Drama Mystery Sci-Fi Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia In episode 1x5, "Damaged," Oliver wears a prison shirt with the number 399471 on the pocket. This is the hex code for the shade of green of his hood. Goofs In the promotional picture for the series it shows a shirtless Oliver. The scars from his time on the island are visible, but there is no tattoo. During the series Oliver has a tattoo on his chest, a tattoo that plays an important role in at least one episode (1x03 "Lone Gunmen") and has been visible in every other episode. Quotes [Season 2 opening] Oliver Queen: My name is Oliver Queen. After five years on a hellish island, I have come home with only one goal: to save my city. But to do that, I can't be the killer I once was. To honor my friend's memory, I must be someone else. I must be something else.
