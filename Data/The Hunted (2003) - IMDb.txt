Bonham, is summoned to track down the elusive and shockingly familiar killer: one of his best pupils, Aaron Hallam. Holed up in the wet and tangled wilderness of Oregon's Silver Falls State Park, Aaron--now a tormented and delusional killing machine--will soon come face-to-face with his grizzled mentor, in a no-holds-barred hand-to-hand combat. Suddenly, age; experience; strength, and the feral will to survive, blur the line between a hunter and his prey. Now, who is the hunted? —Nick Riganas psychopathic killerbody countone man armyex soldierbrutality132 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Some men should not be found. Genres Action Crime Drama Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for strong bloody violence and some language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The martial art Bonham teaches Hallam, and which they employ against each other, is called Sayoc Kali. It is a variation of Eskrima, the Filipino martial arts system dedicated to weapons. Sayoc Kali deals exclusively with knives in extremely close-quarter combat. Goofs The Metro-Area Express (MAX) is shown running on the Hawthorne Bridge. The MAX actually runs along the Steel Bridge which overlooks less-colorful scenery. Quotes [first lines] Narrator: [voiceover] God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son." Abe says, "Man, you must be puttin' me on." God say, "no"; Abe say, "what?" God say, "You can do what you want, Abe, but the next time you see me comin', you better run." Abe says, "Where do you want this killin' done?" God says, "Out on Highway 61." Alternate versions In Germany the film was released on DVD in its uncut form (rated "Not under 18") and in an edited version which has a "Not under 16" rating and misses ca. 5 minutes.

Hey, out there. You guys who slammed this in your reviews, did you see the same film I did? Not real? Improbable? Impossible? Huh. If those of you who found this thought-provoking film about two men on the edge of the social plane, one who is over the edge and the other given the task of hunting the first one down-- both men, socially disaffected and on their own, unbelievable and impossible, give some attention to Alston Chase's article in the June, 200, pp.41-65 of the Atlantic Monthly on Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber and the effects of his experiences being part of the ill-conceived and unethical study on human subjects during his undergraduate years there. The formula is simple: Take a bright, talented person who is teetering on the edge of emotional stability, fill them with lots of head stuff about social and environmental corruption, train in the technology of killing people and then, turn them loose. While no one wanted to turn Kaczynski into the unabomber, the circumstances, however well-intended, did. The film story of Aaron Hallum played by the competent Benicio Del Toro and his counterpart, L.T. Bonham, played by Tommy Lee Jones, bring this theme into clear focus. OK, if you are a shoot'em up thriller fan (as I self-confessedly admit to being), you might have missed the car chase, the sex and all that, but gang, it is a gripping and thought-provoking story. Not real? I submit, read the data on Columbine, The Minn Indian Res and the Unabomber and guess again. It's real. Damn real. helpful•100 51 artzau Mar 27, 2005 Details Edit Release date March 14, 2003 (United States) Country of origin United States Languages English Serbo-Croatian Also known as Загнаний Filming locations Columbia River Gorge, Oregon, USA Production companies Lakeshore Entertainment Alphaville Films See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $55,000,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $34,244,097 Opening weekend US & Canada $13,482,638 Mar 16, 2003 Gross worldwide $46,061,847 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 34 minutes Sound mix DTS Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Hulu New Releases: November 2021 Nov 1Den of Geek Review: "I Wouldn't Be In Your Shoes!"
