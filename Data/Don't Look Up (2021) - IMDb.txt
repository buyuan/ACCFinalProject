The problem - it's on a direct collision course with Earth. The other problem? No one really seems to care. Turns out warning mankind about a planet-killer the size of Mount Everest is an inconvenient fact to navigate. With the help of Dr. Oglethorpe (Rob Morgan), Kate and Randall embark on a media tour that takes them from the office of an indifferent President Orlean (Meryl Streep) and her sycophantic son and Chief of Staff, Jason (Jonah Hill), to the airwaves of The Daily Rip, an upbeat morning show hosted by Brie (Cate Blanchett) and Jack (Tyler Perry). With only six months until the comet makes impact, managing the 24-hour news cycle and gaining the attention of the social media obsessed public before it's too late proves shockingly comical - what will it take to get the world to just look up?. —Netflix meteoritedisasterwritten by directorearthgiant metroite15 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Comedy Drama Sci-Fi Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for language throughout, some sexual content, graphic nudity and drug content Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia Adam McKay originally planned to make the movie for Paramount Pictures before it was acquired by Netflix in April 2020.
