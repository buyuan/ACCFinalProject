Based on reports, Lawrence would make advances at her in addition to groping and kissing Campbell during rehearsals and filming, despite her repeated refusals. Over the years, his behavior became more manic and violent. Only the first 10 episodes of Season five had shared scenes between the Martin and Gina characters. Additionally, Carl Anthony Payne II had personal issues with Lawrence. His character Cole did not appear in several episodes during the last season. Quotes Martin: Damn it, Tommy! We don't need umbilical cords! This is TV! Connections Featured in Oops! The World's Funniest Outtakes 3 (1996) User reviews51 Review Top review Martin! You so crazy! A+ Starring: Martin Lawrence, Tisha Campbell, and Tichina Arnold. Martin Lawrence stars in one of the most hysterical television show ever. The jokes never stop and old jokes are still funny. For instance, Martin and Pam's constant ripping on each other. It was still funny to the last episode. Another instance is when Tommy keeps talking about his job, when he is unemployed. It may not seem funny but when you see it, you'll laugh you're heart out. Why this show was cancelled boggles my mind, and I think it was a completely stupid move to do that. Catch this show on the WB at 10:30 Central Time. Rank: Tied for 2nd (with "Everybody Loves Raymond") helpful•8 6 smla02 Dec 26, 2002 FAQ2 How many roles did Martin Lawrence play in this show?
