Genres Action Comedy Crime Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for some sexual humor and brief violence Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Brandon T. Jackson replaced Jascha Washington in the role of Trent. He was 26 years old when portraying a 17-year-old son. Goofs When Trent / Charmaine (Brandon Jackson) is reviewing his testament, it's incorrectly spelled "testement" in the title of the paper. Quotes Malcolm: I'm not even wearing a clean pair of Granny panties. Alternate versions German theatrical version was cut to secure a "Not under 6" rating. Connections Featured in Conan: The Asiago Index (2011) Soundtracks On the Grind Written by Julian Davis (as Julian Michael Davis), Rachel Rickert, Alana Da Fonseca, Joey Katsaros (as Joseph Katsaros) and Ali Dee (as Ali Theodore) Performed by Rae (as RAE) Feat. Chris Classic (as Classic) Courtesy of DeeTown Entertainment User reviews57 Review Top review a retread of a tired formula Special Agent Malcolm Turner is back in the game (again), going into the field (again) to try and apprehend a notorious Russian gangster, but complications ensue when his rebellious stepson Trent (who doesn't wish to follow in Malcolm's footsteps) gets caught up in the raucous. The plan? Go undercover as Big Momma (again) only this time Trent (in the guise of great-niece Charmaine) is forced to tag along as part of a package deal. Does more really need to be said? Fully grown Jackson is miscast, and never believable in the role of Lawrence's college-aged son, and the flimsy plot about a criminal and his elaborate scheme are just a ploy for the two stars to don the makeup and accessories. Viewers would likely give all this nonsense a pass if the film were actually funny--too bad it's not. The epitome of an unnecessary third entry if there ever was one. *½ helpful•0 0 Special-K88 Jun 23, 2019 FAQ1 What are the differences between the Theatrical Version and the Unrated Version?
