Connections Featured in South Jersey Sam: Top 13 Best Foxes (2011) User reviews121 Review Top review One of the funniest shows ever created Now, I'm not just saying this to prefer or anything, but I always did enjoy the US version of WLIIA better than the UK. Both are hysterical. But I saw the US version first and started watching the UK episodes, and they are funny, but the US version always got me in tears. This show is beyond hilarious. Without scripts, 4 performers entertain through imprave. With fun games, suggestions from the audience, and a fun host this show should be watched. I lost track of it for a while until I found out that it's on ABC family at night. And I'm still on the floors crying from laughter. This is without a doubt one of the funniest shows I have ever seen in my life. Watch it! helpful•30 7 Smells_Like_Cheese Apr 2, 2004 Details Edit Release date August 5, 1998 (United States) Countries of origin United States United Kingdom Language English Also known as W.L.I.A Filming locations Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, USA Production companies Hat Trick Productions Warner Bros.
