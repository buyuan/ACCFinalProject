Personal Quote: [on being a pin-up] I find it very flattering, but when I was younger I was the ginger, pale one that got bullied, that didn't have a girlfriend until he was 21 - and I'm only 22 now.

Trivia: His parents are both of Ashkenazi Jewish descent (their families were from Poland and Russia).
