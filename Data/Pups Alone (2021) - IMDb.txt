Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Began filming in July 2017. User reviews3 Review Top review 3/10 A poor imitation of Home Alone It's bad. It's really bad. Young kids will probably cope, but my 6 year old was quite bored. The acting is just atrocious with stunted looks from the actors absolutely everywhere, made all the worse by drawing it out to almost 2 hours. helpful•2 1 timoc500 Nov 5, 2021 Details Edit Release date November 19, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site VMI Worldwide (United States) Language English Also known as Pups Alone: A Christmas Peril Filming locations Los Angeles, California, USA Production companies Boundless Pictures Firebrand See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 47 minutes Color Color Related news Dolph Lundgren, Scott Adkins and Ryan Kwanten to Face Off in Action Movie ‘Section Eight’ (Exclusive) Oct 20The Hollywood Reporter - Film + TV Fun Trailer for Talking Dogs Comedy 'Pups Alone' with Dolph Lundgren Oct 5firstshowing.net Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Pups Alone (2021) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
