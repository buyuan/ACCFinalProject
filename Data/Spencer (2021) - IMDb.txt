Connections Edited into Amanda the Jedi Show: Faster than your First Time Reviews 2 - Best and Worst of TIFF 2021 (2021) User reviews162 Review Top review 9/10 Many of the negative reviews just hate Kristen Stewart as a person... grow up. The film is good. Ignore the 1 star reviewers who hate Kristen based on one film she did over a decade ago. She is a terrific actress, and her repertoire of under the radar films proves it. She's near perfectly been cast in "Spencer", and the film is just as gripping and successful (if not more) than "Jackie". helpful•121 32 sy-renique Oct 8, 2021 Details Edit Release date November 5, 2021 (United Kingdom) Countries of origin Germany Chile United Kingdom United States Official site Official site Language English Also known as Спенсер Filming locations Sandringham House, Sandringham, Norfolk, England, UK Production companies Komplizen Film Fabula Shoebox Films See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross US & Canada $4,700,176 Opening weekend US & Canada $2,104,767 Nov 7, 2021 Gross worldwide $6,144,108 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 57 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 1.66 : 1 Related news Daily Podcast: Most Anticipated Movies Of The Rest Of 2021 Nov 16Slash Film ‘Eternals’ Tops U.K. Box Office, ‘No Time to Die’ Continues Blockbuster Business Nov 16Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What was the official certification given to Spencer (2021) in Brazil?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
