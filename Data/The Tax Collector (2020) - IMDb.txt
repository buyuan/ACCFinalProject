The Blood gang member character "Bone" (portrayed by Cle Sloan) appeared in Training Day. The film also references the existence of the fictional Latino gang "Hillside Trece," which was the gang Alonzo Harris had dealings with in Training Day, and the gang is mentioned in Harsh Times as well. Goofs At the start David leaves home to go to work in his daggy tracksuit & arrives at work in different clothes. Quotes Creeper: I'll ride with you till the wheels fall off!

This movie has potential but everything goes to heck because of the extremely bad script. First, you need to wait almost 60 minutes of 90 to see something interesting. Second, when the action starts everything goes extremely fast. Shia's character was barely developed. Are you serious? Last, Fx's look cheap and acting amateurish, except from Shia. But... So, overall a wasted opportunity to create a great movie. Shame on Director 's and writers. Make yourself a favor and watch Sicario 1 and 2 instead watching this one. helpful•121 49 danielcereto Aug 8, 2020 Details Edit Release date August 7, 2020 (United States) Country of origin United States Languages English Spanish Also known as Kẻ Thu Thuế Filming locations Los Angeles, California, USA Production companies Cedar Park Entertainment Cross Creek Pictures Faster Horse Pictures See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $20,000,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $1,044,212 Opening weekend US & Canada $309,694 Aug 9, 2020 Gross worldwide $1,325,781 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 35 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news ‘Most Dangerous Game’ With Christoph Waltz Renewed for Season 2 at Roku Channel, David Castañeda Joins Cast Aug 23Variety Film + TV Director Abel Ferrarra Pursuing Shia Labeouf for Comeback Role as Italian Saint Padre Pio (Exclusive) Aug 12Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was The Tax Collector (2020) officially released in India in Hindi?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
