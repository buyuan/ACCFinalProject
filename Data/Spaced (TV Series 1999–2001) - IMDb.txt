As a joke, Simon and Jessica went outside and said "Are you taking pictures of our house?" The fans just stood there for a few seconds, stunned. In good nature, they chatted and then posed for photos. Quotes Tim: We've got two anniversaries. Daisy goes by the first time we kissed, I go by the first time we had sex. Brian: So you had sex before you kissed? Crazy credits Episode 1.6, which features the characters going out to a nightclub, replaces the usual names in the credits with hip hop style alternatives. For example, the show's writers and lead stars Jessica Stevenson and Simon Pegg become 'Jazzy Jess' and 'The Fresh Pegg'. Connections Featured in Skip to the End (2004) User reviews98 Review Top review 10/10 Possibly the best British show ever!!! Well what can I say??? The man is a genius. Simon Pegg, Master of Modern Comedy and the gorgeous Jessica Stevenson (yes I did say gorgeous!) have written and starred in what I consider to be the best British comedy ever. From Colin the lovable dog to Brian the nutty artist who lives downstairs, the script and acting is 5*. Set in London with a fantastic cast including the hilarious Nick Frost as Mike (later Ed in Shaun Of The Dead along with Simon Pegg as Shaun and Jessica Stevenson appearing in cameo role) and Julia Deakin as Marsha, the permanently drunk landlady who lives upstairs, you know you're in for a great night on the TV. It was a shame that there was only ever 2 series made however I can understand why it ended when it did. Best character??? Brian as the somewhat over-emotional artist (Anger, Pain, Fear, Aggression...) My favourite moments in the series??? Tyres enjoying the effects of the rave culture with the help of various household noises!!! Best Line (episode 1) Tim : Daisy this is Brian... Daisy : oh hi, Do you rent downstairs?... Brian : Do you mean am I gay? All In All - ENJOY!!! You Americans don't know what you're missing!!! helpful•90 13 donna3939 Jan 28, 2005 Details Edit Release date September 24, 1999 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Official sites BBC America (United States) Channel 4 (United Kingdom) Language English Also known as Долбанутые Filming locations 23 Carleton Road, Tufnell Park, London, England, UK Production companies Paramount Comedy Channel London Weekend Television (LWT) See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 25 minutes Color Black and White Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 1.78 : 1 Related news Edgar Wright's 10 Favorite Movies Nov 15ScreenRant.com Last Night In Soho Gets A Curated Playlist Of Tunes Handpicked By Edgar Wright Himself Oct 8Slash Film Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Japanese language plot outline for Spaced (1999)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
