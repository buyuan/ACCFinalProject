Connections Featured in CTV National News: Episode dated 9 September 2021 (2021) User reviews29 Review Top review 8/10 Another wonderful Branagh film! I look forward to everything Kenneth Branagh does as an actor, director, writer, etc. His range is on par with the greatest directors ever. However, Belfast is in a league of its own. There is a personal intimacy to the story without it resorting into clichés. Too often mother characters are made out to be shrews while the father characters are made out to be distant and uncaring. In Belfast, the characters are flawed as all human beings are without going over the top. There is conflict within the family without it being overplayed while they struggle with the discord going on around them. There is a gritty authenticity to Belfast. Yes, there is violence . . . But, it has been dosed out in a quantity to help the viewer attenuate to what was going on and not eat up the minutes with bits and bites of storyline thrown in for effect. Belfast is well cast and Jude Hill as Buddy is wonderful. This movie isn't intended to explain the Catholic-Protestant conflict as much as it focuses on the impact to a family and small community. Belfast is subtle storytelling without resorting to so many things films rely on (e.g., CGI, sex, violence, etc.) to keep the audience entertained. Many will not applaud the restraint Branagh demonstrates. It's a movie for a cerebral audience that can appreciate storytelling without special effects or gratuitous trappings. helpful•2 0 robyn-09230 Nov 13, 2021 Details Edit Release date January 21, 2022 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Official site Official site Language English Also known as 벨파스트 Filming locations Belfast, County Antrim, Northern Ireland, UK Production company TKBC See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross US & Canada $1,941,505 Opening weekend US & Canada $1,779,410 Nov 14, 2021 Gross worldwide $1,941,505 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 38 minutes Color Black and White Color Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Video: Let’s chat with the cinematographers of ‘Belfast,’ ‘Being the Ricardos,’ ‘Power of the Dog’ and ‘No Time to Die’ Nov 17Gold Derby Deadline’s Contenders Film: Los Angeles Streaming Site Is Live Nov 16Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Belfast (2021) officially released in Japan in Japanese?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
