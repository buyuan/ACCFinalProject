After finding them, Django wants to find his wife, Broomhilda, who along with him were sold separately by his former owner for trying to escape. Schultz offers to help him if he chooses to stay with him and be his partner. Eventually they learn that she was sold to a plantation in Mississippi. Knowing they can't just go in and say they want her, they come up with a plan so that the owner will welcome them into his home and they can find a way. —rcs0411@yahoo.com racial vengeanceracial violenceslaveryone against manysadism391 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Life, liberty and the pursuit of vengeance. Genres Drama Western Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for strong graphic violence throughout, a vicious fight, language and some nudity Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia When Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) smashes his hand on the dinner-table, DiCaprio did accidentally crush a small stemmed glass with his palm and did really begin to bleed. He ignored it, stayed in character, and continued with the scene. Quentin Tarantino was so impressed that he used this take in the final print, and when he called cut, the room erupted in a standing ovation. DiCaprio's hand was bandaged, and he suggested the idea of smearing blood onto the face of Kerry Washington. Tarantino and Washington both liked this, so Tarantino got some fake blood together. Goofs Dynamite was not invented until 1867 (by the Swede Alfred Nobel), while this film features it on several occasions and is set in 1858. Quotes Dr. King Schultz: [aiming .45-70 rifle at fleeing Ellis Brittle] You sure that's him? Django: Yeah. Dr. King Schultz: Positive? Django: I don't know. Dr. King Schultz: You don't know if you're positive? Django: I don't know what 'positive' means. Dr. King Schultz: It means you're sure. Django: Yes. Dr. King Schultz: Yes, what? Django: Yes, I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle. [Schultz shoots Brittle off his horse] Django: I'm positive he dead. Crazy credits There is a small additional scene with the 3 men in a cage at the very end of the credits. Alternate versions One cut was made by the CBFC to only remove nudity and added a scrolling anti-smoking disclaimer to pass the film with an 'A' (18+ adults only) rating.

It's also the origin of those Di Caprio memes you saw online, so you know is good. Also Christoph Waltz stole the show here and made me discover all other his movies. helpful•37 6 postolachivalentin Apr 25, 2021 FAQ13 Is this a remake/sequel of the film 'Django'? Who is the villain? What is "phrenology" (the term Candie uses during his monologue about Ben and his skull)?
