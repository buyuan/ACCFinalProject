User reviews90 Review Top review 6/10 Missed opportunities and story holes... Lack of clarity in the story robs this of its potential. Some questions are never resolved. One big plot hole involves the immense distance to the extrasolar colony in the Kepler 209 system. At 587 pc (1,914 light years), they would have to have FTL technology. And if they had FTL technology, they would likely have chosen something far, far closer to Earth. Better than that, with the right use of FTL tech, they could have terraformed Mars in a few decades. Great acting, nice cinematography, but pacing seemed too slow in places. A movie like Das Boot could make boredom seem interesting. That time of deep creativity was missing, here. helpful•42 21 RodMartinJr Jul 10, 2021 Details Edit Release date August 26, 2021 (Germany) Countries of origin Germany Switzerland Language English Also known as The Colony Filming locations Tagebau Welzow, Welzow, Brandenburg, Germany Production companies BerghausWöbke Filmproduktion Vega Film Constantin Film See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross worldwide $48,756 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 44 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Atmos Aspect ratio 2.39 : 1 Related news Lionsgate details The Colony Bluray, available now!
