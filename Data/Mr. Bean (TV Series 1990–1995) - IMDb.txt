Vale homo qui est faba") translate to "behold the man who is a bean. Farewell the man who is a bean". Alternate versions The UK/Australian DVD release is cut as well as the American DVD release.

Connections Edited into The Merry Mishaps of Mr. Bean (1992) Soundtracks Ecce homo Written by Howard Goodall Adapted from "Locus Iste" by Anton Bruckner User reviews76 Review Top review MR.BEAN--A PORTRAIT OF COMEDIC GENIUS Most Britcom imports that I have seen over the years have always brought laughter. It the mid 90's PBS began running episodes of Mr. Bean. Rowin Atkinson, far better known in the UK and Europe then here in the States, is one of the most talented actors and comedians anywhere. He has to be. To take a character that is normally mute, always plotting mischief, and goes on more hair brained schemes and adventures then the entire Monty Python crew is,as Mr. Bean would put it," Absolutely Brilliant". Even the most hardened sceptic will find this series so overwhelming funny that they would scream for more. Alas, there were only 13 episodes filmed. Rowin Atkinson has stated that he felt there was nothing more for Mr. Bean to do. Too bad. I can see a series, such as this going on for hundreds of episodes. If you want to have a really good time with a wonderfully lovable goof ball, Watch this BBC classic! helpful•60 9 Barnabasat45 Apr 15, 2001 FAQ5 What types of cars are driven on this show? Who is the driver of the blue, 3-wheeled car and why does Bean have so many run-ins with the car? How did Mr. Bean meet his girlfriend, Irma Gobb?
