Personal Quote: [on the weight she lost after Bridget Jones's Diary (2001)] It saddens me every day when people come up and say, "Okay, how did you lose that weight?". I can't speak about it because I am not an authority on weight loss. I am just not. I am not challenged with a medical situation that's weight-related and that I need to pay attention to.
