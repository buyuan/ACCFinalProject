For the past 60 years, AIPAC has maintained a strict "no interview" policy, but now, for the first time, the founding fathers of AIPAC are speaking out - granting us full access to the untold story of the organization and to the turbulent relationship between Israel and the US. —Docaviv israel united states relationsreference to aipacaipacamerican israeli relationslobbying Plot summary Add synopsis Genre Documentary Parents guide Add content advisory User reviews1 Review Top review 5/10 Needs better editing, reduce the bombastic music Content Ok but difficult to watch. Movie needs some beats - it's just almost non-stop constant content with very few breaks. The biggest difficulty is the music: the almost constant, bombastic music that is more appropriate for a movie about a race than a docmentary. The movie would be much better if paced better and the music was significant reduced. helpful•0 0 zathras110 Apr 15, 2021 Details Edit Release date September 5, 2020 (Israel) Country of origin Israel Language English Also known as Kings of Capitol Hill Production companies Rustic Canyon Pictures Stop Press!
