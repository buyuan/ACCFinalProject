Connections References The New Price Is Right (1972) User reviews6 Review Top review 9/10 An Artistic approach to Murphy's Law I don't know how to express in words what this movie is "about" because it is about A LOT of different things. It's about the world, it's about life as an adult, it's about marriage and love; it's a story that is prime example of Murphy's Law. It's life itself shown in an entertaining way with at times very funny and shocking moments. It's "moving" art in a very abstract way (not Kubrick abstract, more of a Shakespearean irony). This (after 1 viewing) has become one of my favorite movies of the year because of how different it was. A good movie that's hard to summarize yet I get exactly what it's about, that's one of those movies where you don't mind talking about it with friends later (you may not want to watch this with your significant other) or just chatting online about it. I could actually see this being done as a Foreign film so it's surprising that this isn't a Foreign film (although now i am going to see where the screenplay came from). It had that story that we neglect these days in our films. Honestly I can go on and on about the things in this film that just were fantastic but I'd be saying things vaguely because I just don't want to ruin the film for anyone. This is a movie meant to challenge your way of thinking; yes it is very funny at times but it does a lot of things very clever and if you just pay attention to the surface story you will miss a lot of these things that impressed me so so much. It's one of the best B movies / Indie films you will ever see helpful•25 9 scaredsblood Dec 4, 2015 Details Edit Release date November 24, 2015 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Чепуха Filming locations East Village, Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA Production company Factory 25 Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $75,000 (estimated) See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 31 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 1.78 : 1 Related news "James Toback Humped My Leg In Central Park" Nov 16Cinelinx Trump-Era Cinema: The Uncomfortable Necessity of Reliving the 2016 Election Nov 8Indiewire Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Applesauce (2015) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
