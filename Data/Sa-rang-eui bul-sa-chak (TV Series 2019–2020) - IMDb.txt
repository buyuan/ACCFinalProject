Soundtracks But It's Destiny Performed by 10cm Lyrics & Music by Jung Gu Hyun User reviews497 Review Top review 10/10 AMAZING!!!! I made an IMBD account just to write a review for this show. This is my favorite K-drama!!! The story line and the actors and everything about this show is brilliant. I was hooked 5 minutes into episode1!! There's never a boring moment. Love the mix of comedy and action and romance. I also like that each episode is well over an hour long.
