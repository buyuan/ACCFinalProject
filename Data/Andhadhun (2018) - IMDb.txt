Goofs The rabbit walking stick was not a goof. Rather it was a clue to the audience that probably the whole rabbit story was a lie. Akash and Doc might really had killed Tabu and took her eye as the final scene with Akash suggests. The tucking up of the beer can. Quotes Inspector Manohar Jawanda: What color is your cat? Akash: Black and white. Inspector Manohar Jawanda: How do you know? Akash: I was told. [calls the cat] Akash: Rani. Inspector Manohar Jawanda: You cook for yourself? Akash: Forget about me, Sir. Look for Rani, please. Rani might get run over. Inspector Manohar Jawanda: Water? Akash: Chilled? [quickly pours water] Akash: Water. Inspector Manohar Jawanda: Today's newspaper? What for? Akash: To collect cat poo, sir. [gropes the inspector] Akash: You're here? Please look for Rani. I'm lost without her. [hears the bus horn] Akash: Sir, Bandu's school bus. Slap him hard to make him confess. Last week he tied a firecracker to Rani's tail. She ran amok. She hid indoors for two days. That's no good. [Inspector throws a knife at Akash] Akash: What was that? Rani? [finds the cat] Akash: Rani. Where were you? Come, baby. Eat something. You haven't eaten for two days. Good girl. Crazy credits The opening credits read "WHAT IS LIFE? IT DEPENDS ON THE LIVER " as a disclaimer for awareness of alcohol. Alternate versions The UK theatrical release was censored; in order to obtain a 12A classification the distributor opted to make 50 seconds of cuts: removing stronger moments of violence, bloody injury detail and the use of strong language. An uncut 15 classification was available. Connections Featured in Film Companion: Movie Reviews: Andha Dhun (2018) Soundtracks Naina Da Kya Kasoor lyrics by Jaideep Sahni music by Amit Trivedi performed by Amit Trivedi User reviews901 Review Top review 9/10 Decade's Best : Redefines Neo-Noir Brilliant...This cinematic experience will not let you stay back in your seat relaxed. Writers have knitted a pitch perfect Mystery around : Murder,Money & Man who is Blind (!). Taut screenplay and black comic narrative by Raghavan, the story's audacious characters and twists, keep you riveted.Crisp editing grips you.Cinematography is something that boasts the storytelling.Piano scenes are superbly crafted and choreographed , underlined by Amit Trivedi's music and Daniel B George's background score.Couple of acts veneered with poetic touch & Tribute to Chayahar & Chitrageet is something that needs applaud. Tabu is showing her class. Ayushman delivers career best. Rest all are fab too. Dont miss line '"What is life? It all depends on the liver" from prologue.;) helpful•87 28 Rish_tweets Oct 6, 2018 FAQ3 What is the name of song used by Dr. Swami as his ringtone?
