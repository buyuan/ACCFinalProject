At this point in time, 7000 Jews have succeeded in going underground. Almost 1700 will survive the horrors of the war in Berlin. The Invisibles tells the stories of four of these contemporary witnesses. Hanni Lévy, who has just turned 17, has lost both of her parents. Thanks to her dyed, blonde hair, she is practically invisible to her pursuers, and strolls along the Ku'damm to pass the time away. Cioma Schönhaus has also gone underground and leads an adventurous life that consists of buying a sailboat, dining in Berlin's best restaurants, and becoming a forger of passports, through which he saves the lives of dozens of other Jews. And while Eugen Friede joins a resistance group that distributes anti government leaflets, Ruth Arndt and a friend dream about life in America during the daytime; at night, she pretends to be a war widow and serves black-market gourmet foods in the apartment of an NS officer. The dramatic re-enactments are supplemented with impressive interviews with the actual people whose lives inspired this film. The two levels blend together into an intensive, emotionally moving feature film. what happened to epilogueends with real life photosreenactmentinterviewshoah19 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Berlin, 1943: The true story of four young people who must hide their identities to survive Genres Biography Drama History War Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The interviews with the survivors were conducted in 2009.

Connections Features Die Deutsche Wochenschau (1940) Soundtracks Smile Performed by Steve Martin, Henrik Wikström (as Henrik Wikstrom) User reviews15 Review Top review 9/10 Focus on the positive A drama that seamlessly combines interviews with the last living jewish eyewitnesses with recreated film scenes of berlin in the year 1943. In fact this might be one of the last movies with actual contemporary witnesses. Under the many films that cover the holocaust of the jews and more specific the time when jewish people had to live in the shadows, this film is special because the stories of the contemporary witnesses are so moving and astonishing thrilling. A very moving feature with a focus on positive aspects and some of the last good people in the third Reich. helpful•19 4 sangriakoenig May 4, 2018 Details Edit Release date October 26, 2017 (Germany) Country of origin Germany Official sites Official site (Germany) Official site (Japan) Languages German Hebrew Also known as The Invisibles Filming locations Wrisbergholzen, Lower Saxony, Germany Production companies Look!
