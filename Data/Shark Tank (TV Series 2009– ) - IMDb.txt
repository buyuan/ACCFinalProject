Connections Featured in Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: Eddie/Rebecca/Ellen/Leah (2009) Soundtracks Shark Tank - Main Title Theme Written by Berry Gordy (as Berry Gordy, Jr.) and Janie Bradford Performed by Ricky Fante (as Ricky Fanté) User reviews37 Review Top review 8/10 Good learning vehicle if you can gloss over the bad manners "Sharks" is an interesting concept. It's a "reality TV show" and the reality is that budding entrepreneurs come before a collection of 5 experienced entrepreneurs and make a pitch, hoping to attract dollars and guidance from one or more of the so-called sharks. The sharks change from time to time, but the main ones are Robert Herjavec, Daymond John, and Kevin O'Leary. Barbara Corcoran alternates with Lori Greiner as the token woman. Kevin Harrington was an early contributor but lately Mark Cuban has been the 5th member. Herjavec (1963) is from Canada and made his money in internet security. - John (1969) is from NYC and made his money through FUBU clothing line. - O'Leary (1954) is a Canadian and made his money inventing SoftKey and later The Learning Company. he usually plays "the bad guy" - Corcoran (1949) is from New Jersey and made her money in the NYC real estate market - Greiner is called "The Queen of QVC" where she created more than 400 products. She is often the "sweet one" - Cuban (1958) is from Pittsburg and owns the NBA Dallas Mavericks and Landmark Pictures. - Harrington (1957) is famous for creating the first "infomercial" Each episode, guests pitch their products and generally speaking, they are critiqued by the sharks often in a hostile and demeaning manner. That's part of the "show biz" flare, but many people will find it objectionable. As a learning vehicle, the show offers some good examples of how to (and how not to) present their ideas. It's well worth viewing for anyone interested in business and anyone who thinks that at some time they may have to pitch their own ideas. helpful•17 10 drjgardner Jun 24, 2013 Details Edit Release date August 8, 2009 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Official site Language English Also known as Shark Tank: Season 10 - A Decade of Dreams Filming locations Stage 9, Sony Studios, Culver City, California, USA Production companies MGM Television Mark Burnett Productions Sony Pictures Television See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 1.78 : 1 Related news Whatever Happened to Numilk After Shark Tank?
