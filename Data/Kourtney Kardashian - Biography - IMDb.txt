Her father was of Armenian descent and her mother is of mostly English ancestry. In 1991, when she was age 12, her parents divorced and she spent her time between their separate houses in Beverly Hills. Her mother married Caitlyn Jenner, 1976 Olympic Gold Metal Champion for the Decathlon and later had two children with him, Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner. After the O.J. Simpson murder trial propelled Kourtney's father, Bob, into the spotlight (he was a member of the "Dream Team" of lawyers defending the accused murderer in what journalists hail the "Trial of the Century"), her mother decided it would be safer to move her family to Hidden Hills, California. Kourtney attended Marymount High School in Los Angeles, an all-girls private Catholic high school. After graduation, she enrolled at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. After two years, she transferred to the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona. She graduated in May of 2002 with a Bachelor's Degree in Theatre Arts with a minor in Spanish. After graduation, she and her mother opened up children's clothing boutiques in both the Los Angeles Area (818) and New York City, called "Smooch", which carries the brand "Crib Rock Couture". At the age of 26, she starred in a reality television show called Filthy Rich: Cattle Drive (2005) that earned money for charity. Kourtney has a son and daughter with her boyfriend Scott Disick, who she met in 2006. - IMDb Mini Biography By: Anonymous Family (3) Children Penelope Scotland Disick Mason Dash Disick Reign Aston Disick Parents Kris Jenner Robert Kardashian Caitlyn Jenner Relatives Kim Kardashian West (sibling) Khloé Kardashian (sibling) Rob Kardashian (sibling) Kendall Jenner (half sibling) Kylie Jenner (half sibling) Psalm West (niece or nephew) Chicago West (niece or nephew) North West (niece or nephew) Saint West (niece or nephew) Dream Kardashian (niece or nephew) Trivia (16) Older sister of Kim Kardashian West, Khloé Kardashian and Rob Kardashian.
