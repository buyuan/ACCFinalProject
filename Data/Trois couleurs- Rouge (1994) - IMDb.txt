Because of a dog she ran over, she meets a retired judge who spies his neighbours' phone calls, not for money but to feed his cynicism. The film is the story of relationships between some human beings, Valentine and the judge, but also other people who may not be aware of the relationship they have with Valentine or/and the old judge.

Quotes The Judge: I want nothing. Valentine: Then stop breathing. The Judge: Good idea. Connections Featured in Siskel & Ebert & the Movies: Junior/A Low Down Dirty Shame/The Pagemaster/Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle/Red (1994) User reviews184 Review Top review Beautiful, mysterious, and unusual love story One of my favorite films of all time. With beautiful cinematography and a story that ties the previous Kieslowski films ("Blue" and "White") together. The film introduces us to Valentine (played by the glowingly real Irene Jacob), a beautiful and innocent Swiss model and student, who at first glance seems to be happy until one night she accidentally runs over a dog. The dog belongs to a retired old Judge who finds fulfillment in listening to his neighbors telephone calls via wavelength radio. Valentine is at first disgusted and pities him in his own self-pity and despair. But as the Judge and Valentine get to know one another a strange, but fateful bond begins to form. As a subplot, a handsome young Judge named Auguste (who lives across the street from Valentine) has experiences that are exactly like those of the Old Judge! Experiences that will soon lead Auguste into Valentine and into a reunion with characters from the French flag colors trilogy. I loved the love story withing a love story plot and the mystery that resolves the characters that eventually fate takes a hand and lead them to each other. Irene Jacob is absolutely lovely in the role of Valentine. Her large brown eyes seem to echo this innocence and curiosity that is both passionate and touching. It's a film that asks us to watch out for the signs that will soon lead us to our destinies. A very intriguing film and a movie lover's dream. helpful•58 15 bondgirl6781 Sep 10, 2004 Details Edit Release date May 27, 1994 (Poland) Countries of origin Switzerland France Poland Language French Also known as 蓝白红三部曲之红 Filming locations Rue des Sources, Geneva, Canton de Genève, Switzerland Production companies MK2 Productions France 3 Cinéma CAB Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross US & Canada $3,581,969 Gross worldwide $3,581,969 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 39 minutes Sound mix Dolby SR Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Doom Patrol Season 3 Episode 10 Review: Amends Patrol Nov 11TVfanatic Doom Patrol Season 3 Episode 9 Review: Evil Patrol Nov 4TVfanatic Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Japanese language plot outline for Trois couleurs: Rouge (1994)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
