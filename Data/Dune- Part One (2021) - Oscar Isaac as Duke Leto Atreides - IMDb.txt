Duke Leto Atreides : A great man doesn't seek to lead; he is called to it. But if your answer is no, you'd still be the only thing I ever needed you to be: my son. Duke Leto Atreides : We are House Atreides. There is no call we do not answer. There is no faith that we betray. The Emperor asks us to bring peace to Arrakis. House Atreides accepts! Duke Leto Atreides : Smile, Gurney. Gurney Halleck : [blankly] I am smiling. Duke Leto Atreides : Here I am, here I remain. Duke Leto Atreides : Jessica. You gave me a son, and from the moment he was born I never questioned you. I trusted you completely, even when you walked in shadows. Now I'm asking you this one thing. If anything happens, will you protect our son? Lady Jessica Atreides : With... my life. Duke Leto Atreides : I'm not asking his mother, I'm asking the Bene Gesserit. Will you protect Paul? Lady Jessica Atreides : Why are you having these thoughts? Leto, this is not you. Duke Leto Atreides : I thought we had more time. Duke Leto Atreides : Dr. Kynes. You saw it. With your own eyes. It's plain to see. Everything they've left us is in shambles. We've been set up to fail. Liet Kynes : That carryall was just old. The desert isn't kind to equipment. Duke Leto Atreides : You know what will happen, if I don't get spice production back on track. Liet Kynes : I'm not here to take your part. Arrakis has seen men like you come and go. Take good care of your family. The desert's not kind to humans either.
