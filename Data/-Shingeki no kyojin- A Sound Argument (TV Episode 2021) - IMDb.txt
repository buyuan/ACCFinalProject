Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Animation Action Adventure Drama Fantasy Horror Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Quotes Eren: [Looking at the mirror] Fight. Fight! Hange: What are you doing? Were you just saying, "Fight. Fight," to the mirror just now? Hey. You said, "Fight. Fight," didn't you? By "Fight. Fight," what are you fighting? If you're saying, "Fight. Fight," does that mean there're two fights? Eren: [Stays silent] Hange: Keeping quiet isn't helping. Normally, people don't talk to themselves like that. I know I've never talked to myself in the mirror before. By the way, I think your hair is cool. When it's all disheveled, it's kinda like you're hard working and carefree. Eren: [Angrily] What did you come for? Hange: What? To talk, of course. The first time we met, didn't we talk about Titans all night? Though you mostly listened as I blabbered on and on. I honestly believed that you would never sacrifice Historia.
