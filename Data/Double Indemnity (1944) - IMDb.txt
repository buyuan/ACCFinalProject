Phyllis proposes to kill her husband to receive the proceeds of an accident insurance policy and Walter devises a scheme to receive twice the amount based on a double indemnity clause. When Mr. Dietrichson is found dead on a train track, the police accept the determination of accidental death. However, the insurance analyst and Walter's best friend Barton Keyes does not buy the story and suspects that Phyllis has murdered her husband with the help of another man. —Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil insurance investigationmurder disguised as accidentinsuranceinsurance policyinsurance salesman234 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines IT'S LOVE AND MURDER AT FIRST SIGHT! (print ad - Lubbock Morning Avalanche - Lindsey Theatre - Lubbock, Texas - September 1, 1944 - all caps) Genres Crime Drama Film-Noir Mystery Thriller Certificate Passed Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The house used as Barbara Stanwyck's character's home still stands today at 6301 Quebec Drive. Goofs The door to Neff's apartment opens away from, rather than toward, the apartment. This was a violation of the Los Angeles Fire Code. (Billy Wilder knew this, but could not change the door because of the crucial scene where Phyllis is hiding behind the door in the hallway.) Quotes [last lines] Walter Neff: Know why you couldn't figure this one, Keyes? I'll tell ya. 'Cause the guy you were looking for was too close. Right across the desk from ya. Barton Keyes: Closer than that, Walter. Walter Neff: I love you, too. Crazy credits Opening credits are shown over a silhouette of a man on crutches, walking toward the camera.

Fred MacMurray, however, would never again allow himself to duplicate anything similar to Walter Neff's troubled, doomed portrayal again on screen. Playing against their dark alliance, it is left to Edward G. Robinson to win the audience over as he struggles to shed light on the insurance fraud and murder. This script should be studied by anyone who plans to write for TV or movies. Note the significant changes Wilder and Chandler made from James Cain's original novel - changes Cain admitted were improvements. Especially worthy of mention is the level of artistry displayed in the final minutes when, after an hour and a half of of bitter nastiness, Wilder gives us just the smallest spoonful of sugar that wraps everything up perfectly. There's almost something criminal when evil is such a treat to watch. helpful•27 2 jmholmes-73727 Feb 19, 2019 FAQ12 What is 'Double Indemnity' about? Is "Double Indemnity" based on a book?
