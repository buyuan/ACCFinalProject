The writer/director of this movie, Rebecca Hall, is better known as an actress; although she has almost only ever been cast as white characters, she is part African American. In a 2018 interview with Deadline, Hall said, "I came across the novel at a time when I was trying to reckon creatively with some of my personal family history, and the mystery surrounding my biracial grandfather on my American mother's side. In part, making this film is an exploration of that history, to which I've never really had access." Goofs The toy cars in the early stage of the movie were not possible to be made in the '20s as the toy cars from that era could not be produced at contemporary precision. Such precision was not possible until the '90s. Toy cars from the '30s usually had blunt axles without transparent windows nor interior. Quotes Irene: We're all passing for something or other, aren't we? Connections Featured in CBS News Sunday Morning: 10-24-2021 (2021) Soundtracks The Homeless Wanderer Written and Performed by Emahoy Tsegué-Maryam Guèbrou Courtesy of The Emahoy Tsege Mariam Music Foundation User reviews76 Review Top review 7/10 Interpretative This film leaves many things to interpretation but that makes it more special. The film has an interesting plot with a good development and good character development, the good performances, especially that of Tessa Thompson, make the film very endearing and deep, although the story between the two main female characters is missing and leaves wanting to know more about this relationship between them. It is very beautifully shot, has good photography and good production design. The performances are the heart of this film although the story provokes a lot of curiosity about the main relationship, this being a factor that can make the film less enjoyable. helpful•2 0 isaacochoterena Nov 13, 2021 Details Edit Release date November 10, 2021 (United Kingdom) Countries of origin United Kingdom United States Official site Official Netflix Language English Also known as 白色通行证 Filming locations New York City, New York, USA Production companies AUM Group Film4 Flat Five Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 38 minutes Color Black and White Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 1.33 : 1 Related news ‘Red Notice’ Seizes Biggest Netflix Movie Opening Weekend Ever; Italian Pic ‘Yara’ Tops Streamer’s New Weekly Charts Nov 16Deadline Film + TV Film writers group panel: ‘Coda,’ ‘House of Gucci,’ ‘Mass,’ ‘Passing’ [Exclusive Video Interview] Nov 16Gold Derby Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Passing (2021) officially released in Japan in Japanese?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
