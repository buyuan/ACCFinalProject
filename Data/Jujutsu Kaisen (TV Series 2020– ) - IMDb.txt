He hears about a cursed talisman - the finger of Sukuna, a demon - and its being targeted by other cursed beings. Yuji eats the finger to protect his friends, and ends up becoming Sukuna's host. However, Yuji discovers that he has inherited magic and is able to control this power without interference from Sukuna. He joins the Tokyo Metropolitan Magic Technical College to consumes all of Sukuna's fingers, which will enable a full exorcism to take place that will free him. exorcismanimebased on manga Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Animation Action Adventure Fantasy Thriller Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia In ep 23 Gojo flicked megumis forhead so hard he had to go to shoko to get it cured later.
