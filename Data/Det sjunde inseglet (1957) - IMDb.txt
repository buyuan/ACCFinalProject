Black Death is sweeping their country. As they approach home, Death appears to the knight and tells him it is his time. The knight challenges Death to a chess game for his life. The Knight and Death play as the cultural turmoil envelopes the people around them as they try, in different ways, to deal with the upheaval the plague has caused. —John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> deathknightchessdeath personifiedchurch138 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines A film of visual scope, of imaginative concept, of powerful content, written and directed by Ingmar Bergman, twice honored by the Interational Jury at the Cannes Film Festival 1956,1957 Genres Drama Fantasy History Thriller Certificate Not Rated Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Ingmar Bergman credited the film with helping him overcome his crippling fear of death. Because the film dealt so overtly with the subject, he found it a highly cathartic experience. Goofs The chess players focus on capturing the Queen. The Queen was not a super-powerful piece until centuries later when a recent chess-variant initially called "chess of the mad queen" became more popular than the classic game. Quotes Antonius Block: We must make an idol of our fear, and call it god. Connections Edited into Severed Ways: The Norse Discovery of America (2007) Soundtracks Hållas Mellan Rona Music by Erik Nordgren Lyrics by Ingmar Bergman Sung by Gunnar Björnstrand User reviews383 Review Top review Filled With Memorable Images This classic is filled with a lot of memorable images - from the opening scenes on the seashore to the effective concluding shots, creative thoughts are combined with some fine camera work. There are several significant or interesting questions raised by the characters - from the imagery of the "Seventh Seal" in Revelation, to their simple but important concerns about eternity - but it is the way that the visuals play off of the ideas that make the movie so worthwhile. The recreation of the medieval world is convincing and effective, with a lot of detail to set off a varied assortment of characters with different personalities and perspectives. The characters are not necessarily very deep, but most are interesting, and are worth caring about. The ways that they deal with their discouraging situation make you wonder what it would have been like to live in their world. It's also a movie that in some respects is even better to watch over again, after you already know what has happened and can then pick up even more of the detail and imagery. No doubt the somber tone and slow pace will always keep it from being widely popular, and it's not perfect, but it's satisfying in a different way, and deserves its reputation as a classic. helpful•50 26 Snow Leopard Oct 11, 2001 FAQ7 What is 'The Seventh Seal' about?
