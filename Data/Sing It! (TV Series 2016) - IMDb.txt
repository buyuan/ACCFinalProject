User reviews5 Review Top review 1/10 Fine Bros. need to remember why they are on YouTube to begin with I watched the free episode when it came out. Or at least I tried to. Couldn't bear to watch more than 5 minutes before realizing that YouTube made a huge mistake in banking on them to be one of their launch titles for their paid service. They need to remember that they got on YouTube in the first place because they failed miserably at actually writing. They found their niche on YouTube by not having to write, but not they are screwing that up by alienating their fans by forcing ads for this garbage down their throats before every video. And seriously...an American Idol spoof in 2016? Oooh! So timely! That'll show 'em! I half expected to hear characters greet each other with "Wassssuppp!" because the last time an American Idol parody might have been appropriate, those beer commercials were still going on. And then there is the cast. Full of washed up has-beens. People who haven't worked in years. And I hope Debbie Ryan realizes the irony of her appearing on a show that is mocking bad singers. There is a reason why she hasn't done anything since her little Disney show. The only thing worse than her singing voice is her speaking voice. Can't wait for YouTube to pull the plug on this. Or for the Fine Bros. to take a look at their upload history and see that EVERY one of their scripted videos gets like a quarter of the views of their React ones. Maybe then they will realize that writing is not there thing. helpful•7 5 baconbit Jun 3, 2016 Details Edit Release date May 25, 2016 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as En Canta!
