Personal Quote: [when asked by George Stroumboulopoulos if he believes he has been typecast] I've played all kinds of things. I played an old Jewish man in a furniture store in theater, I played the ghost of a black transvestite...I've played British soldiers, I've played French soldiers, I've played New York cops, I've played lawyers, so...no. Trivia: Graduate of The Centre for Indigenous Theatre's Native Theatre School program in 1974.
