Driven by dark humour and off-beat conversation, the series follows Ray as he navigates his chilling business, while also maintaining friendships, parental responsibilities and a fledgling romance. Tough roles to juggle in the modern age and even harder when you're a criminal for hire. gangster romanticizationhitmandark comedy Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Crime Drama Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Based on Scott Ryan's independent film The Magician (2005). He plays Ray Shoesmith, the conflicted hit-man with a heart of gold, in both projects. Connections Spun-off from The Magician (2005) User reviews333 Review Top review 8/10 Good escapist fare Two episodes in and already I'm a fan. The whole "thug for hire" premise suggested this would be a dark show - gritty and serious. Not so. It's actually fairly light-hearted, especially considering the subject matter, and that makes it a fun watch. The cast is largely unknown - at least in the US - but I enjoyed Damon Herriman for years as Dewey Crowe in Justified, and he brings a lot of that Sad Sack charm to this new role. This show isn't going to sweep the Emmys, but it's a pleasant way to kill half an hour, and it has the potential to become a bit more than that. And for those reviewers who complained about the Australian accents, close captioned (subtitled) versions are available on most of the torrent sites. helpful•69 4 trademarcdesigns Sep 27, 2018 Details Edit Release date October 1, 2018 (Australia) Country of origin Australia Official sites Blue-Tongue Films Official site Language English Also known as Містер Посередник Filming locations Sydney, New South Wales, Australia Production companies Blue-Tongue Films Jungle Entertainment See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 30 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 2:1 Related news FX TV Show Ratings (updated 11/10/2021) Nov 11TVSeriesFinale.com ‘Ke Nui Road’: HBO Max Sets Full Cast For Lifeguard Drama Pilot From John Wells & Matt Kester Nov 9Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Hindi language plot outline for Mr Inbetween (2018)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
