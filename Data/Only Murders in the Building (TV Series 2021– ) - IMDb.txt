When a grisly death occurs inside their exclusive Upper West Side apartment building, the trio suspects murder and employs their precise knowledge of true crime to investigate the truth. As they record a podcast of their own to document the case, the three unravel the complex secrets of the building which stretch back years. Perhaps even more explosive are the lies they tell one another. Soon, the endangered trio comes to realize a killer might be living amongst them as they race to decipher the mounting clues before it's too late. buildingcriminalmurderhulustranger5 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Every Body Has a Secret Genres Comedy Crime Drama Mystery Thriller Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Steve Martin is actually playing the concertina in various scenes.

Connections Featured in AniMat's Crazy Cartoon Cast: The Rat of All My Dreams (2020) User reviews569 Review Top review 8/10 It shouldn't work but it does. We all know that Steve Martin and Martin Short can combine to produce comedy gold, but who could have predicted that Steve Martin and Selena Gomez would have such incredible chemistry? Add in the wonderful Nathan Lane and now Sting (!) and after just 3 episodes I am completely hooked. helpful•30 9 yellowmarlin Sep 7, 2021 Details Edit Release date August 31, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Languages English American Sign Language Also known as OMITB Filming locations The Belnord, 225 West 86th Street, New York City, New York, USA Production companies 20th Century Fox Television 20th Television 40 Share Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 30 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news ‘Only Murders in the Building’ set decorator Rich Murray breaks down the trio’s apartments and that Stabler cutout [Exclusive Video Interview] Nov 17Gold Derby Critics Choice Awards Voters’ Guide: 2022 TV Races Heat Up, Thanks in Great Part to ‘Squid Game’ Nov 17Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
