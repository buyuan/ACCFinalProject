There, his invisible and pitiless captors will feed him, clothe him, and sedate him to avert a desperate suicide--and as his only companion and a window to the world is the TV in his stark cell--the only thing that helps Oh Dae-Su keep going is his daily journal. Then, unexpectedly, after fifteen long years in captivity, the perplexed prisoner is deliberately released, encouraged to track down his tormentor to finally get his retribution. However, who would hate Oh Dae-Su so much he would deny him of a quick and clean death? —Nick Riganas imprisonmentpsychological torturerevengebrother sister relationshipcaptive282 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines 15 years of imprisonment, five days of vengeance Genres Action Drama Mystery Thriller Certificate 17 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Four live octopodes were eaten for the scene with Dae-su in the sushi bar, a scene which provoked some controversy abroad. Eating live octopus in Korea is commonplace although it is usually sliced first. When the film won the Grand Prix at Cannes, the director thanked the octopodes along with the cast and crew. Goofs When Woo-jin Lee is searching through the Internet for the word "Evergreen", you can see that the high school website already has been visited on that computer because the link is highlighted in purple colors. Quotes Dae-su Oh: Laugh and the world laughs with you. Weep and you weep alone. Alternate versions Park Chan-Wook stated on his solo DVD commentary that there is an edited version for television broadcast. It omits some of the more extreme violence and the love scene between Oh Dae Su and Mi-do. Connections Edited into 365 days, also known as a Year (2019) Soundtracks Bring My Love by Starsailor User reviews1.1K Review Top review 9/10 Great film! I feel compelled to defend this film from some quite frankly unwarranted criticism. Although it isn't without its flaws, and all films have a few,it certainly isn't a one star film.What this film has is the ability to be sublime, shocking, ridiculous, mildly amusing and visually stunning which is some feat for any film.The sheer scale of the comments here suggests that here is a film that gets to you in one way or another. This film is as far away from Maborosi as you can get yet both films are up there as great pieces of cinema. I wont divulge the plot or end this comment with a Latin quote to reinforce my self importance i'll just say go and watch it, preferably if you're not too squeamish and don't mind subtitles.This film left me thinking about it the following day which is normally a good thing (atleast it shows my memory is working!) helpful•253 165 lucas739 Mar 17, 2007 FAQ3 Is "Oldboy" based on a novel? Is the movie ending the same as in the manga?
