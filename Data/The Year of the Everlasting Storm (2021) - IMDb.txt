Plot summary Add synopsis Genre Mystery Parents guide Add content advisory User reviews2 Review Top review 4/10 A mixed bag of collections about people in the pandemic era I've faithfully watched this documentary-like movie. The best one among these segments is the 2nd Chinese one that had fully portrayed the tough situation during the long lock-down in Wuhan, the family, a young couple and their little son, all of them suffered a great deal of miseries. Their marriage is on the rock, the husband seemingly lost his car sales job, their little kid is completely stressed out.... On and on, this segment is a real movie performed by two great young actors with a so great kid actor. I could never imagine a kid would be able to act like a real son to these two actors. The 2nd better one is the 1st Iranian one. Told us a 90 years old granny tried to visit her children during the severe pandemic that hit Iran so abruptly hard. The huge lizard and the granny are the two bright spots in. I have to say that the 3rd segment may be the worst. The 4th one about spying on people with malware is just too long that really need your patience. All the other segments are just too bad and insignificant to watch; I can only use one word to describe all of the bad ones except the 1st and the 2nd ones. For the 2nd one, I'll rate it 8 or 9 out of 10. The 1st one 6-7/10. The 3rd one, a California one, 0-1/10. The 4th, 6/10; if you have the patience to sit it through. As to those left, the last one from Thailand, 0/10; even worse than the 3rd part. helpful•1 0 Bad-Good-Great Oct 7, 2021 Details Edit Release date September 9, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Also known as 疫年之初 Production companies Animal Kingdom Crater 203 Giraffe Pictures See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross US & Canada $12,245 Opening weekend US & Canada $2,624 Sep 5, 2021 Gross worldwide $12,245 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 55 minutes Color Color Related news Beach House Pictures Takes Majority Stake in Singapore’s Momo Film Co.
