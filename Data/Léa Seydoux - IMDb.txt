Personal Quote: [on her role in Saint Laurent (2014)] I had to become chic, yes. But it's more like a color in the film. It's a very small part. It's like the film is a puzzle and I will be one of the pieces. I prefer to be a small part in a great film. See more » Trivia: Stepdaughter of Farida Khelfa.
