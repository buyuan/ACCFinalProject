Connections Featured in SportsCenter: Episode dated 30 November 2020 (2020) User reviews668 Review Top review 5/10 SHould have been Great, But Badly Directed/edited. Looking through the majority of reviews on here, it seems fairly unanimous that the flashback, time skipping used in this is not popular. I have said before, all of Stephens King's stories are so good because of his building of characters and plot lines, which is lost in all the time jumps. One of the stand out memories from the book was Larry Underwood's back story, which is completely left out. In fact the first mention of him being a pop star is in the final episode, and he is one of the major characters! I have rated it 5/10 because what they gave us was good as far as it went, but only half the story. Why make such a big production and not tell the whole story, should have made it 12 episodes at least. helpful•47 18 fatfil-414-451797 Feb 4, 2021 FAQ6 So where in production is this adaptation at?Has it already filmed or his in pre production?
