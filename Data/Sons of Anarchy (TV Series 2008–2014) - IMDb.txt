They combine gun-running and a garage, plus involvement in porn film. Clay, the president, likes it old school and violent; while Jax, his stepson and the club's VP, has thoughts about changing the way things are, based on his dead father's journal. Their conflict has effects on both the club and their personal relationships. —Pia motorcyclegun runningporn actressirish mobfictional town78 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Let freedom ride Genres Crime Drama Thriller Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia David Labrava, who plays Happy Lowman, is a real life member of Hells Angel MC. He was hired as a technical advisor but asked Kurt Sutter for a chance to be on the show. He won't talk about his association with Hells Angels (though photos of him wearing his kutte can be found online and he has the death head tatted on him). It is said he's currently an inactive member since doing the show, but is still in good standing with the club. Goofs In Season 3, Tara became pregnant with Thomas when Abel was 8 or 9 months old, which means Abel must have been about 18 months old when Thomas was born. Thomas barely ages throughout the rest of the show, while Abel keeps growing. At the end of Season 7 Abel is 5, and Thomas is still just a baby of maybe a year old. By that time, Thomas had to be 3 at the very least. Quotes Jackson 'Jax' Teller: [voiceover, reading his fathers memoirs] A true outlaw finds the balance between the passion in his heart and the reason in his mind. The outcome is the balance of might and right. Crazy credits Season 3 episodes Lochan Mor (2010), Turas (2010), Fírinne (2010), and Bainne (2010) used an Irish rendition of the main theme song. Connections Featured in The Wright Stuff: Episode #15.15 (2011) User reviews555 Review Top review 10/10 A good show to be remembered for years. Only a few shows get stuck in your mind for quite some time after you finish watching them. Only few shows. For me Sons of Anarchy is one of them. This is not just another show about a ruthless lawless biker gang, but it is a show about ruthless moral filled biker gangs who are well aware of the rights and wrongs of society and human nature. Never disrespected women and always took care of their own. Kurt Sutter is a specialist in that kind of genre, ever since from The Shield. By the way, another brilliant show co-written by SOA's creator. The music is beautiful and some of the songs are just great, along with the casting, every piece fits. Yaa we know that at the end everything always favored our title gang but that's why the series finale was written like that. No spoilers. Give this show a chance and try to stick with it till the end before giving a rating. Don't know why people judge a show by giving rating after seeing only few episodes or seasons. Action+music+brotherhood+entertainment+drama. A good package. helpful•103 14 ansharora-12638 May 8, 2020 FAQ15 Is this show a modern retelling of Hamlet? Who is Sam Crow? What does SAMCRO stand for? Is there a difference between the two? What exactly does the "If you can't ride, you can't vote" rule mean?
