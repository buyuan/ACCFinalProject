Personal Quote: [on Woody Allen] didn't ask to see or know anything [about my character] until he rolled the camera. His feeling is that the best, complete thing he's going to get is going to come out of the actor's instinct. And what he finds out on day one is whether or not he cast it well. See more » Trivia: He has appeared in one film that has been selected for the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically or aesthetically" significant: Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982).
