Years after his death, he is cursed by the almighty to stay immortal forever and endure the pain of seeing his loved ones die as a punishment for the beastly killings he committed in the wars to protect his country. He becomes an immortal goblin, helping people with his powers and being a kind man in spite of his grieving past. The only way to put an end to his immortality is the Goblin's bride, who can see and remove the sword in his chest and end his painful life. Closer to the present day, Kim Shin has waited 900 years for a human bride to end his immortal life. One night, he saves a dying pregnant woman who is destined to die. The woman gives birth to a baby girl named Ji Eun Tak. 19 years later, Ji Eun Tak is a bubbly high school student who remains cheerful and hopeful despite her tragic life. She summons the goblin by chance and their fates begin to entwine. Kim Shin's nephew Yoo Deok Hwa leases Shin's house to a Grim Reaper and the two end up living under the same roof. Sunny is a charismatic young lady who runs a chicken shop in which Ji Eun Tak works as a part timer. As the lives of Kim Shin, Grim Reaper, Ji Eun Tak and Sunny interweave, a deeper story unfolds as they are not just strangers who met-by chance but people with deep-rooted relations. —T interspecies romancecursed with immortalityangel of deathcursegrim reaper28 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Comedy Drama Fantasy Romance Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia In one of the episodes, Goblin (played by Gong Yoo) is screaming over a movie. The movie he is screaming over is actually his own movie Busanhaeng (2016). Quotes Kim Shin: [narrating] Mass is not proportional to volume. A girl as small as violet. A girl who moves like a flower petal pulls me with a greater force than earth. Just then, like Newton's apple I rolled toward her without stopping until I fell on her, with a thump. With a thump. My heart was bouncing between the sky and ground.It was my first love. Connections Referenced in Part-Time Idol: Episode #1.3 (2017) Soundtracks Stay With Me Performed by Punch & Chan-Yeol Park User reviews175 Review Top review 10/10 Gold Standard Once in a very long while, the stars align to create truly transcendent art on screen. "Goblin" is an example of this, as the maturation of talented writer Kim Eun-Sook blends with nuanced directing, breathtaking cinematography and the formidable acting skills of Gong Yoo and the rest of the stellar cast. This is great art and great television, regardless of the country of origin. That is not to minimize the South Korean expertise that created it, but simply to avoid the sometimes- backhanded compliment of "great...for a KDrama." It's just great TV, full stop. I've watched KDramas for about a decade, and this one is the best I've seen. Highly recommended, not just for drama fans, but for all fans of quality cinematic art around the world. helpful•104 8 Pickwick12 Feb 5, 2017 Details Edit Release date December 2, 2016 (South Korea) Country of origin South Korea Official sites Netflix Official site (South Korea) Language Korean Also known as Guardian: The Lonely and Great God Filming locations Québec, Québec, Canada Production companies Hwa and Dam Pictures Studio Dragon See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 16:9 HD 2.39 : 1 Related news The Daily Stream: It's Time To Ring In Gong Yoo Season With The Fantasy K-Drama Goblin Oct 5Slash Film ‘Spider-Man: No Way Home’ First Trailer Welcomes Doctor Octopus – and Maybe Green Goblin? – to MCU (Video) Aug 24The Wrap Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What was the official certification given to Sseulsseulhago Chalranhashin: Dokkaebi (2016) in France?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
