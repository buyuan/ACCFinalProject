It is an intense study of a violent world far from media scrutiny - where land grabs make developers billions, and politicians are bought and sold by the world's largest oil and lumber corporations. Where drinking water poisoned by fracking wells and unsolved murders are not news: they are a consequence of living in the new frontier. It is the best and worst of America seen through the eyes of a family that represents both. —ahmetkozan cowboy hatequestrianranchmontanaranch owner24 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Drama Western Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The Chief Joseph Ranch, a 150-acre spread located in the Bitterroot Valley, is the stand in for Dutton ranch. Connections Featured in WatchMojo: Top 10 Summer TV Shows Not on Your Radar (2018) User reviews840 Review Top review 9/10 Country Version of Sopranos This is the type of show where cowboy/western life meets big city mafia life. This show is well cast, the first two episodes have been well written and leaves you wanting more after every episode. Not to mention the Montana and Utah scenery is beautiful. The Dutton's remind me of the Ewing's from the 70's drama "Dallas". In short Yellowstone is "Dallas" meets "Sopranos". helpful•168 34 darrinhanby Jul 9, 2018 FAQ5 Are any of the Native American characters actually natives?
