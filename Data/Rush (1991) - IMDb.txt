For his next assignment he chooses the more inexperienced but tough and good-looking Kristen. Their ultimate target is Gaines, a renowned but very elusive drug dealer. While doing their work they unexpectedly fall into a morass of drug-addiction and fall in love with each other. Despite subjecting themselves to the life of low-class, one-track junkies they do not get the evidence they want to convict Gaines, and instead are forced into using false evidence in court. —kwedgwood@hotmail.com billiardspolice officerwatching tvpayphonetelephone booth129 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Somewhere between the buy, and the high... they forgot they were cops. Genres Action Crime Drama Romance Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for graphic drug use and for sensuality, language and violence Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Jason Patric actually did shoot up for authenticity's sake for the film, though the substances he used in his syringes were either saline or vitamins. Goofs (at around 10 mins) When Jim slams the door of the Charger and the window falls down, you can see the hand of a crew member in the back seat quickly pulling something to let the window fall. Quotes Willie Red: I think she fix... I think she fix , or she don't walk outta' here. Connections Featured in Siskel & Ebert & the Movies: Rush/Naked Lunch/The Prince of Tides/Fried Green Tomatoes/Madame Bovary (1991) Soundtracks Tears in Heaven (released as a single on 8 January 1992) Written by Eric Clapton and Will Jennings Performed by Eric Clapton Produced by Russ Titelman User reviews44 Review Top review 8/10 Excellent drama, much better than expected I watched this only because Sam Elliott was in it, expecting little from Patric & Leigh, whom I looked upon as TV-quality lightweights. I was quite wrong -- both can act with great strength when given a quality script (a rare item in Hollywood). This is an intense, driven tale about undercover cops firmly entangled in the drug underworld, with the criminal activity and hypocrisy evenly spread between the cops and the dealers. The accuracy of this portrayal and the obvious futility of the "War on Drugs" explain why this film was hammered loudly by the police departments, newspapers and mainstream critics. To anyone who hasn't spent time around serious junkies this film will be a bit of a jolt, but it's the best and most honest portrayal of this world ever put on film. This is definitely not your standard two-cop "buddy" films that spew forth so often from the Hollywood colon. The story is not predictable, nor is the ending....nor the ending after that ending. Scripts like this are jolting because they make you realize just how awful most of the other films actually are. Some of the secondary actors turn in surprisingly nice jobs here. Sam Elliott turns in his usual good work, always enjoyable, but several others are well worth mention: Max Perlich, the pathetic little snitch, and Gregg Allman, who with almost no dialogue does a very convincing portrayal of a malevolent local crime kingpin. This is one of those rare movies where the soundtrack is worth owning. Eric Clapton does a superb score, and his selection of music for the saloon and drug den scenes is masterful. I've watched this three times, each a few years apart, and it gets better each time. The film doesn't have rely on fancy car chases, lengthy gunfights or comic relief. It's simply a fine film done by craftsmen -- a rare treat indeed. helpful•52 6 smokehill May 18, 2000 Details Edit Release date January 17, 1992 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Кайф Filming locations The Swinging Door - 3818 Farm to Market 359, Richmond, Texas, USA Production companies Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) The Zanuck Company See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $17,000,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $7,241,350 Opening weekend US & Canada $36,890 Dec 22, 1991 Gross worldwide $7,241,350 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 2 hours Color Color Sound mix Dolby SR Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Rush (1991) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
