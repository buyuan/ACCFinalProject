Still reeling from the loss of a dear one, Jim spends his days with his inseparable companion, Jackson, the sheepdog, unbeknownst to him that his already complicated life is about to take an unexpected turn. Now, as desperate Rosa entrusts Jim with the life of her young son, Miguel, an inadvertent, all-out war with the brutally violent henchmen of the murderous cartel leader, Mauricio, breaks out. Suddenly, Hanson has one more problem to deal with, and the road to Chicago, where Miguel's relatives are, is long and fraught with danger.

Genres Action Drama Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for violence, some bloody images and brief strong language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The scene where Jim and Miguel are in the hotel, both watch the classic Clint Eastwood western Hang 'Em High (1968). The film's director, Robert Lorenz, worked with Eastwood for many years as a producer and included this scene as a tribute to his mentor. Goofs The pickup truck goes throughout the movie alternating between having bullet damage and not having bullet damage. Quotes Jim: I don't scare easy.

Klatt Performed by Jack Klatt Published by Riff City Sounds Courtesy of Yep Roc Records User reviews425 Review Top review 6/10 Standard Liam Neeson movie This is only the second film by director Robert Lorenzo. Who's he? Exactly. He is best known as an assistant director and producer of mostly Clint Eastwood films and some great ones like Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby. His first solo film is Trouble with the Curve where the main role is played, surprisingly, by Clint Eastwood himself. I really liked that movie. The difference between this and this film is the script, this time he wrote it himself and it is not good at all. It is often predictable, one-way, and uneven. Overall though, I can't judge the film with Liam Neeson where he plays himself badly. He will turn 69 this year, and he is still making films like this. I call this a typical Liam Neeson movie, if you've watched one in the last ten years, you've watched it all. A gloomy man with a difficult and vulnerable past who does not look for troubles but they find him, and he possesses special skills that he is forced to use. The good thing about movies like this is that you know you're going to get what you expected, and all of those movies are good or very good, they won't disappoint you. Same thing with this movie. If you're going to look for holes in the script or criticize the characters, then this is not the movie for you. If you're looking for a movie that will entertain you or take a break from your commitments for a hundred minutes, and you're a fan of Mr. Neeson like me then I can definitely recommend this movie to you. helpful•76 36 ivanmessimilos Jan 25, 2021 Details Edit Release date January 15, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Official Facebook Official Facebook Languages English Spanish Also known as The Minuteman Filming locations Wellington, Ohio, USA Production companies Cutting Edge Group Raven Capital Management Sculptor Media See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $23,000,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $15,566,093 Opening weekend US & Canada $3,104,204 Jan 17, 2021 Gross worldwide $22,988,549 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 48 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 2.39 : 1 Related news Ed Westwick, Madalina Ghenea Team for Shark Survival Thriller ‘Deep Fear’ Nov 17The Hollywood Reporter - Film + TV ‘French Dispatch’ and ‘Last Night in Soho’ Start to Lift Stagnant Specialty Box Office Nov 9Indiewire Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What was the official certification given to The Marksman (2021) in Italy?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
