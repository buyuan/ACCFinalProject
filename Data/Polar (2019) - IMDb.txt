Genres Action Crime Drama Thriller Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The cabin where Vanessa Hudgens's character lives is the same as the one from I Heard a Rumor (2019). The back travelling shot of the last scene is almost the same as the one used in that episode. Goofs The owl is obviously a captive owl, as the noise it makes are 'baby' sounds which young owls make when begging for food. Mature owls that have grown up in the wild do not make this noise as they have learned to hunt for their prey and do not have a need to beg for food. Quotes Duncan Vizla: Try not to be scared. Crazy credits The end credits roll from top-to-bottom instead of the more widely used bottom-to-top Connections Featured in Everything Wrong with...: Everything Wrong With Polar In 17 Minutes Or Less (2019) Soundtracks September Performed by Earth Wind & Fire (as Earth, Wind & Fire) Written by Al McKay, Maurice White, Allee Willis (c) Steel Chest Music/EMI Blackwood Music Inc./EMI April Music/Irving Music, Inc.

Over the top action? ✔ Overdramatic main villain? ✔ Replaceable side villains? ✔ Listen guys.. don't compare this movie with john wick and ruin the popcorn time, afterall this is comic book adaptation. Yes, this movie is not perfect (hint: lame villains) but you won't regret watching MM in action. helpful•221 69 blueeye-silntkilr07 Jan 25, 2019 FAQ4 Is that Johnny Knoxville in the first trailer @ :38?
