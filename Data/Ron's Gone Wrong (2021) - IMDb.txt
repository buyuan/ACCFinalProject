Genres Animation Adventure Comedy Family Sci-Fi Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG for some rude material, thematic elements and language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia This is the debut feature of Locksmith Animation. Goofs In a scene with Barney's push pin board, there is a sticky note that reads "colour." Although the animation studio is British, the setting appears to be the United States, specifically California, where the British spelling is not used. Crazy credits End credits start when suddenly comes a computer-like error. Later, Ron interacts throughout the end credits doing things like playing pong and being chased by 4 mini b bots. Connections Featured in AniMat's Crazy Cartoon Cast: Geeked Week for Freaks (2021) Soundtracks Happy Birthday Written by Patty Hill & Mildred J. Hill User reviews57 Review Top review 8/10 Such a fun movie with a good message for our times! Definitely worth a watch. Both kids and adults will enjoy it. Really interesting concept and story holds up. A bit on the lines of Big Hero 6, Next Gen, Mitchell's against the Machines. If you like animation movies this is a good one to watch. helpful•3 0 steveykaeb Oct 27, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 15, 2021 (United Kingdom) Countries of origin United States United Kingdom Canada Official site Official site Language English Also known as Ron: Chú Robot Khác Biệt Production companies 20th Century Studios TSG Entertainment Locksmith Animation See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross US & Canada $20,879,030 Opening weekend US & Canada $7,300,225 Oct 24, 2021 Gross worldwide $53,679,030 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 47 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Dolby Atmos Aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 Related news Bo Report: ‘No Time To Die’ records highest opening weekend of pandemic-era Nov 15IF.com.au Box-Office Weekend: Eternals Neuters Clifford Nov 15CinemaNerdz Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
