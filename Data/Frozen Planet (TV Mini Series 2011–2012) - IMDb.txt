Connections Edited into Universum: Eisige Welten - Das Reich der Kälte im Bann des Klimas (2017) User reviews15 Review Top review 10/10 Simply astonishing! To describe all the beautiful footage in this documentary is simply not possible. It's easily the best i have ever seen, even better than BBCs "planet earth" which was unique because of its big budget and extended production time (16M £, 5years). It's probable that production paid off in terms of skill and it certainly comes to show here in BBCs next effort when the mysteries and beauty of our planets frozen worlds is on the agenda. More than anything else this production is a profound statement on how precious and unique our planet is and how immensely important it is that human impact on fragile ecosystems is kept to a minimum. Richard Attenbourough is, as we all know by now, the perfect narrator. His deep interest and knowledge in natural history is apparent, adding a pleasant edge to this marvelous achievement. helpful•14 2 fikamugg Jan 25, 2013 Details Edit Release date October 26, 2011 (United Kingdom) Countries of origin United Kingdom United States Spain Germany Greece Canada Languages English Russian Also known as David Attenborough's Frozen Planet Filming locations North Pole, Arctic Production companies British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) Discovery Channel Antena 3 Televisión See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 5 hours 33 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news BBC Studios Showcase to Remain Virtual in 2022 Jul 13Variety Film + TV BBC and Nat Geo filmmaker Chadden Hunter joins WildBear Mar 15IF.com.au Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Frozen Planet (2011) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
