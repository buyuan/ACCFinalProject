Chili Palmer happens to be in Hollywood collecting a gambling debt when he's struck by lightning (not literally). Called a natural for the movie business, he's snagged up by a producer. The rest is history. —Joshua Davis <xtnb64a@prodigy.com> movie businessloan sharkhare krishnacooldark comedy100 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Drug smuggling. Racketeering. Loan sharking. Welcome to Hollywood! Genres Comedy Crime Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for language and some violence Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Elmore Leonard said that this is the best film adapted from one of his books. Goofs After he visits Martin Weir's house, Chili's minivan is pointing in a different direction. Quotes Ray "Bones" Barboni: I'm from Miami-fuckin'-Beach and you wanna show me the ocean, huh? And what about sun, does it ever shine around here, or is this smog around all the time? Limo Driver With Sign: They say the smog is the reason we have such beautiful sunsets. Ray "Bones" Barboni: That's what they say, huh? What a bunch of fuckin bullshit. Alternate versions A line of dialogue from John Travolta is missing from the UK 2-disc edition. The line "So You're Trying to Say You're Never Gonna Sleep Again?" comes directly after the credits as a question to Martin Ferrero's character. The line is dubbed and subtitled, and the music plays out as usual, so it's not an audio glitch. The line is present on the first UK MGM-release.

John Travolta followed up his "Pulp Fiction" comeback with "Get Shorty", in which he plays Miami hit-man Chili Palmer. Moving to Hollywood to collect a debt, he finds that show biz isn't much different from the mafia, and he decides to get involved. But of course, once there's anything mafia-related involved, things start to get ugly. Not that they weren't already seedy. This movie has its strengths mainly in the script, but also in the strong performances from Travolta, Gene Hackman, Rene Russo and Danny DeVito. I guess that any time that someone gets a chance to show Hollywood's unseemly side, they take it. Of course, there's plenty of reasons to do so. The sequel, "Be Cool", wasn't quite as good, but still worth seeing. helpful•51 8 lee_eisenberg Jul 3, 2005 Details Edit Release date October 20, 1995 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites HenryB.net MGM Studios (United States) Language English Also known as El nombre del juego Filming locations 1017 N Crescent Drive, Beverly Hills, California, USA Production companies Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) Jersey Films See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $30,250,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $72,101,622 Opening weekend US & Canada $12,700,007 Oct 22, 1995 Gross worldwide $115,101,622 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 45 minutes Color Color Sound mix DTS Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news The Simpsons Video: Brian Cox Narrates Chilling Opening of Two-Part Special Nov 5TVLine.com ‘The Simpsons’ Turns Into a Prestige TV Crime Thriller in This Exclusive Trailer for ‘A Serious Flanders’ Nov 3Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Japanese language plot outline for Get Shorty (1995)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
