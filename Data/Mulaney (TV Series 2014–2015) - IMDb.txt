Genre Comedy Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia Ice-T does the narration after the opening credits. John Mulaney did a bit about Ice-T on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (1999) in his comedy special 'New in Town'. Quotes Ice-T (announcer): [Opening credits narration] Mulaney is filmed in front of a live studio audience, okay? Connections Featured in WatchMojo: Top 10 Worst TV Shows of All Time (2016) User reviews27 Review Top review 2/10 Poor acting Very poor acting, especially by Mulaney's part; specifically over acting, funny in some respects but I get the feeling that he is trying too hard to be Seinfeld. The only good aspect of this show is the acting done by Martin Short, great actor and great character. This show needs to change its acting skills in most respects except for Nasim Pedrad and Marin Short. Otherwise it is going to be canceled before it finishes airing its first season. A tip, don't have Mulaney do his comedy act at the start and in some bits of the episode, in his apartment, it reminds the viewer that it is a show, fictional. Viewers watch comedies to escape life through humour and they are suppose to seem realistic, not actually showing that they are not. helpful•14 15 ranieriluke Nov 3, 2014 Details Edit Release date October 5, 2014 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Fox (United States) Language English Also known as Малэни Filming locations 4427 Radford Ave, Los Angeles, California, USA Production companies Broadway Video Jurny Mulurny TV 3 Arts Entertainment See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 30 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news Justin Spitzer Re-Ups Overall Deal With Universal Television Aug 18Deadline Film + TV Jean Smart’s ‘Hacks’ Shows The Generational Differences And Female Perspective Of Stand Up Comedy May 18Hollywood Insider - Substance & Meaningful Entertainment Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Mulaney (2014) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
