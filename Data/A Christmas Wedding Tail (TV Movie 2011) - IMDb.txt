Connections Featured in On Set: The Making of 'A Christmas Wedding Tail' (2011) Soundtracks Shooting Star Written and Performed by Pete Howard User reviews8 Review Top review 1/10 I recommend it ..... not Could this movie BE any worse? I think not. A story we've already seen like a million times before, lines that we've heard in a million other films. Nothing original, no actual plot, and the acting is so superficial. I mean, it feels like they're reading the screenplay all along. The only one who didn't suck as much as the others was Tom Arnold. The movie has cliché written all over it from the beginning. The only reason I watched this movie was because of Jennie Garth. I hadn't seen her in a movie in a long time, and I expected to be blown away (now I wonder how I could ever have such an awful idea). I kept waiting for a twist,but no, it was the same crap we see in a lot of American movies all over again. BORING. All in all, the worst hour and a half spent in watching a movie in the history of watching movies. helpful•14 7 sanja_milosevska Dec 12, 2011 Details Edit Release date November 19, 2011 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Una boda perruna por Navidad Filming locations Santa Ynez, California, USA Production companies Hybrid Feifer Worldwide Lancom Entertainment See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $2,500,000 (estimated) See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 30 minutes Color Color Related news Christmas marathons: 'Duck Dynasty,' the yule log and more Dec 24Zap2It - From Inside the Box 'Holidaze's' Jennie Garth: 'I've done a couple that weren't so good' Dec 6Zap2It - From Inside the Box Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
