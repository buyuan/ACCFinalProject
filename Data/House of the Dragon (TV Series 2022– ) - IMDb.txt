Martin stated: "I expect to be involved in [House of the Dragons] to some extent...and, who knows, if things work out, I may even be able to script a few episodes, as I did for the first four seasons of GAME OF THRONES. But... let me make this perfectly clear... I am not taking on any scripts until I have finished and delivered WINDS OF WINTER. Winter is still coming, and WINDS remains my priority, as much as I'd love to write an episode of HOUSE."
