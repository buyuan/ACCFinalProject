Titans are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source. A small percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in a city protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the biggest of titans. Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a titan in over 100 years. Teenage boy Eren and his foster sister Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a colossal titan that appears out of thin air. As the smaller titans flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother is eaten alive. Eren vows that he will murder every single titan and take revenge for all of mankind. giantman eating monstertitananimeeating human flesh50 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines The face of humanity's extinction. (season 1) Genres Animation Action Adventure Drama Fantasy Horror Certificate (Banned) Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The manga artist, Hajime Isayama, got the idea for the Titans when he encountered a drunk customer at a coffee shop he worked in. He was inspired by the inability to communicate and realised the most dangerous thing was the human race. Quotes Armin Arlert: Someone who can't sacrifice anything, can't ever change anything. Connections Edited into Attack on Titan Abridged (2013) Soundtracks Attack on Titan: original Soundtracks Composed by nZk User reviews1.6K Review Top review 10/10 Amazing Anime This anime is simply amazing! The way it is animated, the soundtrack, the characters, the story, the thrill and the suspense. All in one action-packed anime. One of the best so far. As it has only 9 episodes as of now ... many critics say that it is way too early to rate an anime. But, according to me, this is pure class. The soundtrack's tempo varies according to the situation and this makes it more exciting. The ending of the episode is something that NO one will look forward to as NO one will want it to end. A must watch for every anime lover and of course the manga is available as well. Although a bit gory, the epicness makes up for it! You know those animes that catch your eye from the first episode, this is one of them. helpful•462 69 somanshreddy Jun 5, 2013 FAQ3 when do we have season 4?
