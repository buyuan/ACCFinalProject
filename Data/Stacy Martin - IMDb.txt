Personal Quote: [on performing graphic sexual material] Your body is your tool as an actor. A painter has his brushes, a musician has his instrument, and as an actor you use your body. We had a nudity contract and porn doubles were there, so everything was set up to make me feel comfortable. In the end, all the nudity and sex stuff is so technical it kind of becomes a mechanical thing and stops being an issue.
