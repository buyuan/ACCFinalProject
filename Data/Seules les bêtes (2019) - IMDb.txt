Following a snowstorm, her car is found on the road up to a plateau where a few isolated farms struggle to survive. While the gendarmes have no leads, five people know that they are linked to this disappearance. They all have their secrets, but no one suspects that the whole story began far from this mountain swept by winter winds, on another continent where the sun beats down and where poverty does not prevent desire from dictating its laws. —UniFrance talking to a dead bodydisposing of a dead bodyolder woman younger woman sexromance scamsuicide116 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Crime Drama Mystery Thriller Parents guide User reviews37 Review Top review 8/10 Recognizable tale of people seeking a way out of their dull lives Seules les bêtes starts off with the disappearance of a non-local woman that owns a house in a remote rural area somewhere in France. Multiple people's lives in that area are shown in this story, they are all connected in one way or another through work or simply because they use the same supply store. All of them, except the missing person, have lead fairly dull lives: They are regular people living fairly far apart, don't exactly like the life they are living and seek a way out of the day-to-day by the only limited means they have. One seeks it online, another through adultery or through (creepy) fetish imagination but they all want the same. All of these lives are somehow stitched together, carefully explored and eventually coming together in a not every day, yet mostly recognizable story of loneliness, unemployment, deceit, feeling unloved, wishing for, and seeking a better life, real or not, even risking the little they have got and cross the invisible line. Seules les bêtes is an enjoyable drama/crime/thriller movie for all sorts of people, it explores both sides of the coin. helpful•12 1 Digital_excitation Nov 8, 2020 Details Edit Release date December 4, 2019 (France) Countries of origin France Germany Official sites Cinéart (Belgium) Cinéart (Netherlands) Languages French Nushi Also known as Only the Animals Filming locations Florac, Lozère, France Production companies Haut et Court Razor Film Produktion GmbH France 3 Cinéma See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget €5,000,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $9,138 Opening weekend US & Canada $3,389 Oct 31, 2021 Gross worldwide $882,001 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 57 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 2.39 : 1 Related news How ‘Les Miserables’ Actor Damien Bonnard Prepped to Play a Painter With Bipolar Disorder in His New Film Nov 5Variety Film + TV Only the Animals | Review Oct 27IONCINEMA.com Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Seules les bêtes (2019) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
