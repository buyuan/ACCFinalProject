School's out for the summer and the Little Family is spending their big vacation at a beautiful lakeside cabin near Lake Garland. But meanwhile, there is something lurking in the forest who could spoil all the fun: the Beast; a mean and isolated forest terror who rules the local animals with an iron paw. When Snowbell is taken prisoner, a Little bravery goes a long way as Stuart, along with his new skunk friend, named, Reeko, who heroically rescues Snowbell, frees the other woodland creatures and outwits the wily Beast. —Anthony Pereyra <hypersonic91@yahoo.com> skunkslimehousestuart little characterbeastlake17 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Call of the Wild Genres Animation Comedy Family Fantasy Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) G Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Corey Padnos replaced Jonathan Lipnicki, as he was too old to reprise the role of George, and Kevin Schon and Rino Romano replaced Nathan Lane and Steven Zahn, as Snowbell and Monty, for unknown reasons. Goofs Right after Brooke and George put the gold kerchief on Stuart's shirt and before the troopmaster apologises to Mr Little for mocking Stuart, Stuart's kerchief is red.
