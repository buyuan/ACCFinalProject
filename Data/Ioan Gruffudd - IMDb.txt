Personal Quote: In the past, I have felt slightly pigeon-holed with the success of roles like Hornblower, all ruffled shirts and wonderful costumes. I think Launcelot was the turning point because he's more masculine, more dangerous, which goes hand in hand with me growing older. I want longevity, so I'm always trying to escape the way I'm perceived - you know, Ioan the soft-spoken Welshman. See more » Trivia: His name is pronounced "Yo-wahn Griffith".
