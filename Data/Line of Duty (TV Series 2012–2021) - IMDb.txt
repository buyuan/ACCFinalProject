In the subsequent investigation, Arnott refused to cover up negligence in the planning and execution of the raid and unable to work in his unit anymore, Arnott receives a transfer to AC-12, a unit tasked with uncovering police corruption. Arnott is partnered with Detective Constable Kathrine "Kate" Fleming (Vicky McClure), a highly commended undercover officer with a keen investigative instinct. They work under the supervision of Superintendent Edward "Ted" Hastings (Adrian Dunbar), who is one of several Senior Investigating Officers responsible for uncovering corruption within the police force. Throughout the series, AC-12 investigate seemingly disparate cases involving seemingly corrupt police officers, with each series focusing on a different corrupt officer and AC-12 soon realize the pervasive nature of corruption and the police's deep-rooted links to an organized crime group with ties to drug running, prostitution, child exploitation and people trafficking. —World Productions conspiracypoliceinternal affairspolice corruptionfemale police detective11 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Lies Cost Lives (Series 6) Genres Crime Drama Mystery Thriller Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Police Rank Acronyms: PC - Police Constable.

Connections Featured in The Wright Stuff: Episode #17.120 (2012) User reviews438 Review Top review 9/10 Strong British series, in the Scandinavian style In recent years, I have generally "moved on" from Poirot-Wallander type of series (usually 1 episode - 1 solved case) to more sophisticated and intertwined series where events take place in parallel and with flashbacks, and for full comprehension, one should watch all the episodes in sequence. It take more time and dedication, but there are more versatile characters and more complex situations where one can ponder on and over more intensely. Line of Duty is a really fine example of the above. The two series - so far - have been really catchy to follow, there is both mind-work and twisted turns, and they are more or less equal (in my opinion, One has a bit stronger performances thanks primarily to Lennie James as DCI Tony Gates, but Two has a bit meatier script). But anyway, I did really enjoy the course of events, the often thin line between cops and crooks (what about its actuality?), and nice round-up of things that really took place. I would juxtapose Line of Duty with e.g. Engrenages (France) and Ørnen: En krimi-odyssé (Denmark). I am looking forward to next seasons already. PS. 3, 4 and 5 are meaty as well, please proceed :) PS. 6 has somewhat less interesting outcome, but interesting twists and turns still visible. helpful•94 11 BeneCumb Mar 31, 2015 FAQ3 What city is this supposed to take place in?
