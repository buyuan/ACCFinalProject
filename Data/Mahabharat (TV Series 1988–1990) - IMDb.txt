Quotes [Krishna has told Karna the truth about his birth and begs him to join the Pandavas in the upcoming Kurukshetra war. Karna turns down the offer, but later that day, he approaches at a temple alone] Karna: O, Creator! Why have I been tormented like this, to learn the truth about my birth? The Sun is still the source of light to the world! My mother is still a respected queen! Yet I, the result of their union, am a wanderer... But I will never give up Duryodhana! [shouts] Karna: Do you hear me? I will never betray him! He has given me far too much in friendship! I will never betray Duryodhana! Connections Featured in Mahabharat Ki Mahabharat (1990) Soundtracks Ath Shree Mahabharat Katha Performed by Mahendra Kapoor. User reviews132 Review Top review This is amazing... ...if you have the time to watch it consistently, and give it your attention. This is a very demanding piece of work-- there are many characters, and many plots going on simultaneously. Stop watching for a few days and you might just forget what was going on. Nevertheless, this is an amazing piece of work, incredibly moving, and affecting like very few works before it. I can't overstate how incredibly emotional the experience of watching it from beginning to end was; the ending, in particular, is a extremely powerful. True, the scenes are a bit drawn out at times; personally, as director, I would have shaved off about 10-15 minutes from each episode. Obviously, the special effects are outdated as well, but they are sufficient to get the point across, which is the most important thing. Ideally, this series should be watched when you have 4-5 days dedicated to just watching it from beginning to end. Yeah, that's a big dedication, but it is also an incredibly rewarding experience. helpful•49 2 Voivod-2 Jul 7, 2005 Details Edit Release date October 2, 1988 (India) Country of origin India Language Hindi Also known as Махабхарата Production company B.R.
