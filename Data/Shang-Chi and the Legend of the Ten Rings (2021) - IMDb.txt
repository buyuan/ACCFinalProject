Genres Action Adventure Fantasy Sci-Fi Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for sequences of violence and action, and language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia In the late 1980s Stan Lee had considered a film/TV series about Shang-Chi, and had in mind Brandon Lee, son of martial arts superstar Bruce Lee, for the role. Shang-Chi was visually based on Bruce Lee, so Brandon seemed a fitting choice, but the plan fell through. Goofs The cutting of the brake lines on the bus early in the movie leading to a runaway bus with no brakes is inaccurate. Buses use air brakes. Air brakes by their nature will automatically brake the bus if the air lines are cut, not the other way around as with traditional car brakes. Quotes [Morris discovers Trevor's still body, and mourns] Trevor Slattery: Calm down, mate! I'm not dead, it's just a performance! Now get down here and play along! [Morris rolls over and plays dead] Crazy credits There is a scene at the end of the closing credits: Xialing takes control of the Ten Rings. Following this scene is Xialing's Ten Rings insignia and a statement: "The Ten Rings will return."

There are a bunch of unneeded "deux-ex machina" or conveniences because the writers trapped themselves into corners for no reason (that's what happens when you get the 2021 "Mortal Kombat", "WW84" and "The Expendables" writers). Also, we have Awkwafina destroying every type of scene (dramatic; epic; and also the comedic ones) with one of the worst "acting" I've ever seen and a same type of joke ("awkward nonsense") over and over, from start to finish, with a role ridiculously large for a dumb comic relief. But... Liu is actually pretty good as a lead (and his character is potentially great), and the "Shang-Chi world" is beautiful and it has everything to be super fun to watch in the future...without Awkwafine and better writers. helpful•104 48 educallejero Sep 14, 2021 FAQ5 Who exactly is 'Shang-Chi'?
