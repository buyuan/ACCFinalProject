Among those up-and-comers is Alfred Miles, a hot new artist who is trying to understand the line between real life and street life. He is managed by his cousin, Earn, who gets caught up in the local rap scene and his cousin's career after returning home to the ATL. Earn does whatever he can to try to get Alfred's career to the next level. Darius, the rapper's right-hand man and visionary, is also in Alfred's entourage. When Earn isn't busy managing his cousin's career, he spends much of his time with best friend Vanessa, who is also the mother of his daughter. —Jwelch5742 satirecharacter credited as selfafrican americanmale protagonistno opening credits6 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Comedy Drama Music Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Paperboi's hit song "Paperboi" is performed in real life by Donald Glover's brother, Steve G.

Connections Featured in The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon: Dolly Parton/Donald Glover/U.S. Women's Gymnastics Team (2016) User reviews109 Review Top review 9/10 Hilarious This show is extremely funny but not for everyone. It doesn't just tackle hip hop culture it also makes fun of many modern day sociopolitical issues. I would recommend for people who are open minded. helpful•41 16 nnbutler-69928 Feb 24, 2018 Details Edit Release date September 6, 2016 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Official Facebook Official Instagram Language English Also known as Atlanta: Robbin' Season Filming locations Atlanta, Georgia Production companies FX Productions MGMT Entertainment See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 30 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 1.78 : 1 Related news FX TV Show Ratings (updated 11/10/2021) Nov 11TVSeriesFinale.com Angelina Jolie Slams ‘Eternals’ Ban: Anyone Threatened or Angry by Gay Roles Is ‘Ignorant’ Nov 5Indiewire Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What was the official certification given to Atlanta (2016) in India?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
