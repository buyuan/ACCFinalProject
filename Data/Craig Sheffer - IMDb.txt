Personal Quote: [on acting in films] I think it's real easy to look at what's out there and get discouraged. I was never the best-looking guy, I was never the Tom Cruise-looking guy. I think the biggest thing I can say is, "Don't compare yourself". Focus on making you the best you you can be as an actor and follow your own path. You can't compare an apple to an orange. It will cause a lot of self-esteem issues. Trivia: Is godfather to ex-partner Gabrielle Anwar's children, Hugo and Paisley, from her marriage to John Verea.
