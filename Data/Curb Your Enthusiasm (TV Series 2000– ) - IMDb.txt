Seinfeld co-creator Larry David stars as himself in this hilarious, off-kilter comedy series that presents an unflinching, self-deprecating depiction of his life. —Penske actor playing himselfmisperceptionmisconceptionmisunderstandinghusband wife relationship24 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Deep inside you know you're him. Genre Comedy Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia In 2003, a man named Juan Catalan was arrested for murder in Los Angeles. He repeatedly professed his innocence, and asked to take a polygraph test, a request that the police denied (note: polygraph tests aren't admissible in court). He also had an alibi. He swore that at the time of the murder, he was at Dodger Stadium with his little girl, watching the Dodgers vs. the Braves, but his lawyer was unable to find him in any of the Dodger Vision or FOX footage he subpoenaed. However, he discovered that there was another source of crowd footage: Curb Your Enthusiasm season four, episode six, The Car Pool Lane (2004) had filmed at Dodger Stadium that night. Although Catalan did not make the final cut of the show, his lawyer was finally able to find him and his daughter in the outtakes, and determined from the timestamps on the tapes that Catalan could not have been the killer. When told that his show had released a wrongfully accused man from prison and a trial that could have led to the death penalty, Larry David commented, "I tell people that I've now done one decent thing in my life, albeit inadvertently." The documentary Long Shot (2017) is about these events. Goofs In season five Richard Lewis has a set of golf clubs that he's so attached to that he won't loan them out, even to Larry who has just agreed to give him a life saving kidney transplant. In season six Larry and Jeff take Richard golfing and he knows nothing about the game. Quotes Larry: Nice house. Susie: Yeah, come on. I'll give you a tour. Larry: Naw, it's ok. Susie: No, come on. Larry: No, it's ok. I-I get it. Susie: You get it? Larry: Yeah, it's a house. It's new. I get it. It's nice. Susie: You get it? Ok, you know what? Get the fuck out of my house, Larry. Crazy credits Since the dialogue is always ad-libbed, the episodes get a "Story by" credit but not a "Teleplay by" credit. Alternate versions The DVD version of "Wandering Bear" omits a scene shown on television in which Larry and Jeff watch "Girls Gone Wild" and nudity is shown. Connections Featured in The 54th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards (2002) Soundtracks Frolic (uncredited) Music by Luciano Michelini [Theme music] User reviews283 Review Top review The BEST entertainment possible This is without a doubt the best show to come out of Amercia for years and why does the UK struggle to show it? This is the front runner to comedies like The Office and Extras and is made to a standard higher than anything else that is currently shown. Larry David is just a funny character. He has all the qualities of a perfect leading man and when he is placed into the mundane situations that happen around him he starts to question everything. There have been a few comedies in the past that have tried to do this (not including Seinfield) which he co-created but this is the best. If you have never seen Larry David I would suggest that you buy the DVD box set now because this will change your life. An no I do not work for him!!!! Although given half a chance I would give up a career in medicine to follow him. Definitely a 10/10. The best thing around for years. helpful•105 20 fatherofmichaeluk Apr 13, 2006 Details Edit Release date October 15, 2000 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites HBO The Official Curb Your Enthusiasm Fanlisting Language English Also known as Зменш свій ентузіазм Filming locations 537 Moreno Avenue, Los Angeles, California, USA Production companies Home Box Office (HBO) Production Partners See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 28 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Related news Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 12?
