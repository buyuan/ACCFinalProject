The employer, Sri Ramachandramurthy has some frivolous notions about character, moustache, patriotism, thrift, recreation, etc. Chandran changes himself as a Nehru-jacket wearing, boring person, with no interests other than studies. His plan goes for a toss when he lies about his (dead) mother's accident to watch a football match. Unknown to him, his boss finds him having a fiesta in the stadium. To avoid losing his job, he creates a fictional wild and westernized twin Ayyampettai Arivudainambi Kaliyaperumal Indran by removing his moustache on the advice of his actor friend Nagesh and becomes the music teacher for his equally wild daughter. Confusion and complications ensue when he has to recruit a small-time actress as his mother, and a kid who knows the proceedings starts blackmailing him. ‚Äîmanojar mustachetwinremakecameo appearancelie14 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genre Comedy Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia It was on the sets of this movie Rajnikanth met Latha, a college student, who would become his wife the next year.
