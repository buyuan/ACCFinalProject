More than a biography of the greatest literary genius the American theater has produced, this American Experience production is a moving meditation on loss and redemption, family and memory, the cost of being an artist, and the inescapability of the past. It is also a penetrating exploration of the masterpieces O'Neill created only at the very end of his career -- "The Iceman Cometh" and "Long Day's Journey Into Night" pre-eminent among them -- brought to life in mesmerizing scenes performed especially for the production by some of the most gifted actors working in theater today, including Al Pacino, Zoe Caldwell, Christopher Plummer, Robert Sean Leonard, Liam Neeson, and Vanessa Redgrave.

Despite the typical Ric Burns hagiographic film-making  the teary-eyed music, Christopher Plummer at his plummiest reading a text so worshipful it seems an intentional parody, and the incessant drumbeat of "greatness, greatness, greatness"  the viewer is left with more than enough evidence to see what Burns and the writers apparently cannot (or will not) see  that their much-revered subject was at best an egotistical monster, at worst, a navel-gazing jerk. Even when O'Neill commits the central (and basest act) of his life, abandoning his faithful wife and his two small children without even a good-bye to run off with a hot mama, the filmmakers try to frame this tawdry behavior as something brave and noble, a great artist's quest for beauty. (In Burns' universe, "greatness," whatever that is, excuses anything and everything.) Without batting an eye, the filmmakers applaud the hot mama for luring the great man from his family by telling him that a man as great as he is should never have to smell a diaper. Did I mention that she was a compulsive liar and mythomaniac? But she told the "great" man what he wanted to hear, and one imagines the sex was pretty hot, at least for a while. But it's all okay because eventually O'Neill is able to get on with the "great" work, which is writing the play in which he can finally "forgive" the drug and alcohol-riddled family that made him. It's all about me, me, me, Eugene O'Neill; of course it never occurs to him to write a play about the family he himself created and destroyed, or to ask their forgiveness. In fact, the creep goes out snubbing his nose at his two children, writing them out of his will (talk about mooning the misbegotten!) and leaving everything to the hot mama, who promptly betrays his dying wish so she can make a killing on the play he never wanted published. Of course, this gave the world more "greatness," so the filmmakers duly drop to their knees in worship. Ric Burns should try making a documentary with no music, no narrator to tell us what to feel and think, and without once using the word "great." For once, we might actually begin to see his subjects as they were, not as they are worshiped. helpful•1 3 steven-222 Jul 18, 2008 Details Edit Release date March 21, 2006 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Production company WGBH See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 2 hours Color Color Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
