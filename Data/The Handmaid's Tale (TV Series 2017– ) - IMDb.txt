In this country women are second-class citizens. Anyone trying to escape is punished. One such person is June, who is captured while trying to escape with her husband and child and is sentenced to be a handmaid, bearing children for childless government officials. As a handmaid, June is renamed Offred. This is her story. —grantss rapedystopiaviolence against womenslaverytorture85 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines We will bear no more Genres Drama Sci-Fi Thriller Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Margaret Atwood, the source novel's author, makes a cameo as an aunt in Episode 1. She is the one who slaps Offred when she is reluctant to join in the group shaming circle. Goofs Although all guards (security personnel) have earphones, there's always a radio chatter audible. Quotes Moira: Hey, that shit is contagious. You want to see your baby girl again? Then you need to keep your fucking shit together.

Your wait is Over. THIS is IT. Strong is the word for this series, and little, weak people detest strong so be prepared for the fake reviews and thumbs down across the actual reviews for it. Fear is a powerful thing. The Handmaid's Tale is perhaps one of the the best Television accomplishments of not only the year (hands down), but of the decade. It is a profound glimpse into a future that could very well happen were it not for people like most of you and me. In three unforgettable episodes, so far, women such as Offred ("Of FRED", since she belongs to Fred), played by the inimitable Elisabeth Moss, are coerced through bodily harm to be both concubine and scape/punching goat for well to do families. These women are subjected to physical, emotional and mental abuse in the name of God, or if not so much in the name of God, under the twisted word of god, by man. This is not to say that it is a Christian-bashing show, but it depicts what could happen under a theocratic society. What is most outstanding is that the acting is so amazing, that its quietest moments may be its most powerful. In fact, at times, the series can be emotionally overwhelming and draining — but isn't that a characteristic of a superb and masterful viewing experience? Don't turn away from it. helpful•448 318 MajorMAlice May 1, 2017 FAQ4 In what time is the plot set? So who exactly are " the Americans " mentioned on more than 1 occasion ?
