Genres Adventure Drama Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for thematic content, brief strong language, and partial nudity Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Robin Wright was initially attached only as the director but stepped up to star as well because of a scheduling issue. Wright said: "We got down to a scheduling issue and a time crunch where we had to shoot this movie in this window of time, and we only had 29 days to shoot it. And we just couldn't take the risk trying to hopefully get somebody in that window of time. And then the producers just said, 'Well, why don't you just do it?', and I said, 'Well, I'm going to be there anyway, so okay.'" Goofs The backpack Edee is wearing during her long walk late in the film (not being too specific as it would be a spoiler) switches from one with side pockets and a bedroll at the bottom to a military-style pack with MOLLE straps and no bedroll and back again. She wore the latter pack in several earlier scenes. Quotes Edee: Why are you helping me? Miguel: You were in my path.

LAND is a touching study of a woman steeped in grief, determined to leave life behind in the midst of a devastating happening. Robin Wright effectively directs from an angle of isolation, both of place and of mind. It's a solid directorial debut and a raw, emotional performance. A lot of moments and scenarios feel familiar, and while that hinders the overall experience, LAND is so beautifully shot with such deeply heartfelt performances that it earns a lot of respect by the end. The film's biggest achievement is the its second half, and the subtle way it works through grief and pain in restrained, tender moments. helpful•36 14 JasonMcFiggins Feb 1, 2021 Details Edit Release date February 12, 2021 (Canada) Countries of origin United States Canada Official site Official site Language English Also known as Незвідана земля Filming locations Alberta, Canada Production companies Big Beach Films Cinetic Media Nomadic Pictures See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross US & Canada $2,577,830 Opening weekend US & Canada $899,810 Feb 14, 2021 Gross worldwide $3,164,246 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 29 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 1.66 : 1 Related news New to Streaming: Passing, Ryusuke Hamaguchi, No Time to Die, and More Nov 12The Film Stage HBO Max New Releases: November 2021 Nov 1Den of Geek Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Land (2021) officially released in Japan in Japanese?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
