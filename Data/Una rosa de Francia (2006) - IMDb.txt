Atracadores (2020) Soundtracks Una rosa de Francia Written by Rodrigo Prats and Gabriel Gravier Performed by Coco Freeman User reviews4 Review Top review 6/10 don't be too harsh it may not be accurate but having heard the director talk about his film in person i can tell you he did not intend it to be a historical or political piece. it is a love story that is enjoyable to watch so people should stop criticising it for not being something it was never intended to be. if people did stop pointing out whats wrong with it for one second they may be able to see whats right about it. For example, the colours and sets used create a beautiful feeling and transport the viewers to the golden era when beauty was so important to cinematography. overall i would describe this film as charming, it may not be for everyone but i know that there will be many who can appreciate this film for what it is without immediately criticising it for attempting to be something it never wanted to be in the first place. helpful•12 7 clare_f Sep 10, 2006 Details Edit Release date February 3, 2006 (Spain) Country of origin Spain Language Spanish Also known as Virgin Rose Filming locations Havana, Cuba Production companies Instituto Cubano del Arte e Industrias Cinematográficos (ICAIC) Tornasol Films See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross worldwide $132,601 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 40 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 Related news Ana de Armas Recalls Reaction From Acting School When She Got Her First Movie Role Oct 9The Hollywood Reporter - Film + TV "No Time To Die" - Enter Ana De Armas Jan 29SneakPeek Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Una rosa de Francia (2006) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
