I'm just not sure why he came to America in the first place. Man, we don't want your soccer. There's no way Americans are going to buy the idea of 90 minutes of running around without much happening. Thanks for trying guys, but we'll stick to baseball and basketball. See more » Trivia: His father, Donald E. Wahlberg Sr., a veteran of the Korean War, passed away on February 14, 2008.
