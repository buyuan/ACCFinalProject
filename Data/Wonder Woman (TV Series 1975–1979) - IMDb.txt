He is rescued by Princess Diana, who learns of the war against the Nazis. The Amazons decide to send one of their own to help fight in this crisis. Although forbidden to participate in the selection process, Diana joins secretly and wins the right and responsibility to go. Taking the still unconscious Major to safety, she joins him as Yeoman Diana Prince. Furthermore, when the forces of evil threaten the nation, Diana would spin to transform into Wonder Wonder, armed with a magic belt giving her tremendous strength, bracelets that can stop any bullet, a tiara that can be thrown as a returning weapon and a unbreakable magic lasso that can force anyone to tell the truth. After WW II, she returned to the Island, only to encounter Steve Trevor Jr., agent for IADC, thirty years later. Seeing the amazing coincidence as a sign, she returns to the Man world once more to resume her role as the greatest of the female superheroes. —Kenneth Chisholm <kchishol@execulink.com> amazon warriorprincesslove interestaction heroinewoman wears eyeglasses109 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Bullets bouncing off her bracelets!

Genres Action Adventure Fantasy Sci-Fi Certificate TV-G Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia When the son of Jeannie Epper, Lynda Carter's stunt double, told his classmates that his mother performed on the Wonder Woman television series, they didn't believe him, even after he showed them a photo of his mother in costume. When Carter heard about it, she invited his entire class to visit the Wonder Woman set to see Epper perform. Goofs When Wonder Woman runs, she wears flat boots. When she stands still or walks, she is suddenly wearing high-heeled boots.

Alternate versions Both the ABC pilot episode - "The New Original Wonder Woman" - and the ABC premiere episode that brought the series forward into the 70's - "The Return of Wonder Woman" - originally aired as 90-minute episodes. For syndication, these episodes are often edited down to run in a standard 60-minute time slot. The full version of "The New Original Wonder Woman" is contained on the DVD boxed set of the first season, and the full version of "The Return of Wonder Woman" was included on the second season box set. Connections Featured in Technology/Transformation: Wonder Woman (1979) Soundtracks Wonder Woman Music by Charles Fox Lyrics by Norman Gimbel User reviews54 Review Top review Should Have Stayed In WWII It's too bad that "Wonder Woman" strayed from its origins after it moved from ABC to CBS. The original ABC episodes were probably some of the best efforts at bringing comic book fun to life. Once the series was moved from its WWII setting to the present, the only thing that improved was Lynda Carter's costume. "Wonder Woman" became too much of a routine type of adventure show and lost its sense of good-natured fun and camp that the WWII episodes served up (and poor Lyle Waggoner became practically non-existent as "Steve Trevor, Jr.") Still, there is little doubt that Lynda Carter made a lasting impression as Wonder Woman. Her qualities of incredible beauty and wide-eyed innocence enabled her to make the part her own and the reason why we've never seen a big screen adapation of Wonder Woman is because Carter's portrayal still looms large even today. helpful•29 10 Eric-62-2 Sep 21, 1999 FAQ6 What does IADC stand for?
