Personal Quote: I'm a yarnteller. My job is to engage you as much as I can and as often as I can. I love the process and still continue to adore the process, actually. I don't get attached to anything. I'm like a good antique dealer. I'm prepared to sell my most valuable table. See more » Trivia: He was approached to replace Bryan Singer as the director of Bohemian Rhapsody (2018). See more » Trademark: He is called the father of "director's cut". Scott was one of the first directors to re-release a director's cut in theaters and, because of the great success of his new version of Blade Runner (1982), made the concept popular among directors and audiences. Since then Scott has released many more director's cuts or extended versions of his films, but mostly on DVD / BluRay.
