Pattinson was Reeves top choice to play Batman because he was "always that version of what I saw in the page. I think of Bruce Wayne as this recluse rockstar in a decaying manor. There's this part of me that so saw Rob (Pattinson) as that & I had no idea that he would be interested in playing the role at all. I thought what if Rob doesn't want to play Batman? This would be a disaster". But Pattinson had been chasing the role of Batman for much longer than anyone knew; he had heard in 2017 that Reeves was working on a script that reimagines Bruce Wayne in the younger years of his life. Pattinson: "I've had Batman in my mind for a while. It's such an absurd thing to say." When Reeves finally finished the script, they had a meeting in LA. Pattinson: "I had to kind of try to imagine what he'd written, and I hadn't even read the script. I'd come with this pad full of notes." Quotes Edward Nashton: If you are justice, please do not lie / What is the price for your blind eye?
