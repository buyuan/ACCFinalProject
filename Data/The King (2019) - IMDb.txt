Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia All characters existed in real life, except John Falstaff. In Henry IV Parts 1 and 2, William Shakespeare based Falstaff loosely on the historical Sir John Oldcastle, a companion of Prince Henry. He renamed the character because of Oldcastle's powerful family. Goofs When Prince Henry and Hotspur are first fighting in full armor, modern rubber soles are visible on their feet. Quotes Sir John Falstaff: A king has no friends. Only followers and foe. Connections Featured in WatchMojo: Top 10 Streaming Releases in November 2019 (2019) User reviews835 Review Top review 9/10 Timothee Chalamet.... a smouldering superstar in the making. Brilliant, well-paced supremely-acted bopic of the young Henry V. Slow-paced but in a good, thoughtful way, with a great and haunting score, and the Battle of Agincourt was realistically portrayed. Took me a few minutes to recognize Joel Edgerton as he was middle-aged, portly and with a brilliant Lancashire accent. However, undoubtedly, Timothee Chalamet dominates this movie with a tour de force performance. What a screen presence for someone so young, especially when he isn't speaking. I have no doubt he is going to be huge, the next Leonardo DiCaprio I suspect. helpful•26 2 frank-brennan-1 Jan 14, 2020 FAQ2 When will The King be released?
