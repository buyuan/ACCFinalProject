Determined to uncover the mystery, Hiro transforms his friends into a band of high-tech heroes called "Big Hero 6." —Walt Disney Animation Studios robotsuperheromartial artsteenagersan francisco california192 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines From the creators of Wreck-It Ralph and Frozen. Genres Animation Action Adventure Comedy Family Sci-Fi Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG for action and peril, some rude humor, and thematic elements. Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia According to Scott Watanabe, the movie is set in an alternate future where after the 1906 earthquake, San Francisco was rebuilt by Japanese immigrants using techniques that allow movement and flexibility in a seismic event. After the city was finished being rebuilt, it was renamed San Fransokyo due to it being a city with Japanese and American architecture combined. Goofs In the warehouse, Hiro holds a broom as a weapon as he approaches the barrel of microbots, but when he comes closer the broom is nowhere to be found, and there is no sound to indicate that he dropped it. Quotes Baymax: [upon fist-bumping] : Balalalala Crazy credits At the very end of all of the credits, there is a scene between Fred and his superhero dad (a Stan Lee cameo). The Stan Lee credit runs after this special scene. Alternate versions In the UK version BBC Radio 1 presenters and Youtubers Dan Howell (danisnotonfire) and Phil Lester (AmazingPhil) were given the roles of Male Technician 1 and 2. This version, however, did not end up in the UK home release. Connections Edited into Zenimation: Cityscapes (2020) Soundtracks Boca Dulce Boca Written by Estéfano (as F.

We saw it in IMAX in 3D and we were both blown away. Although this time the central character is a young boy - Hiro Hamada of the city of San Fransokyo - rather than two princesses, my granddaughter had no trouble relating to it because Hiro is so cute, his inflatable robot Baymax is androgynous, and two of his four friends - making up the six heroes - are very capable girls. I reckon that "Frozen" plus "Big Hero 6" - with a few films in between - will give her a lifelong love of the movies. helpful•31 12 rogerdarlington Feb 6, 2015 FAQ13 Is this movie based on a book?
