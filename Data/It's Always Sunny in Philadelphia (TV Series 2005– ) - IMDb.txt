Genre Comedy Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Was almost canceled after its first season, but renewed at the last minute when FX executives decided to give it room to grow. It has gone from the brink of cancellation to being one of the highest rated and most popular shows on FX, and with its fifteenth season has become the longest-running live-action sitcom in television history. However, The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, which ran for fourteen seasons (1952-1966), still holds the record for most episodes at 435. In order for Sunny to surpass the earlier show (and if only 10 are made a season as been the practice for the last several years) it would therefore have to run through to 2048 (season 42). Quotes Mac: What do we need a mattress for? Dennis Reynolds: What do you mean what do we need a mattress for? Why in the hell do you think we just spent all that money on a boat? The whole purpose of buying the boat in the first place was to get the ladies nice and tipsy topside so we can take 'em to a nice comfortable place below deck and, you know, they can't refuse, because of the implication. Mac: Oh, uh... okay. You had me going there for the first part. The second half kinda threw me. Dennis Reynolds: Well, dude, dude, think about it. She's out in the middle of nowhere with some dude she barely knows. You know, she looks around and what does she see? Nothin' but open ocean. "Ahh, there's nowhere for me to run! What am I gonna do, say no?" Mac: Okay. That... that seems really dark. Dennis Reynolds: Nah, no, it's not dark. You're misunderstanding me, bro. Mac: I'm-I think I am. Dennis Reynolds: Yeah, you are, because if the girl said no then the answer obviously is no... Mac: No. Right. Dennis Reynolds: But the thing is she's not gonna say no; she would never say no because of the implication. Mac: ...Now, you've said that word "implication" a couple of times. Wha-what implication? Dennis Reynolds: The implication that things might go wrong for her if she refuses to sleep with me. Now, not that things are gonna go wrong for her, but she's thinkin' that they will. Mac: But it sounds like she doesn't wanna have sex with you... Dennis Reynolds: Why aren't you understanding this? She-she doesn't know if she wants to have sex with me! That's not the issue... Mac: Are you gonna hurt women? Dennis Reynolds: I'm not gonna hurt these women! Why would I ever hurt these women? I feel like you're not getting this at all! Mac: I'm not getting it. Dennis Reynolds: Goddamn. [notices old woman staring at them] Dennis Reynolds: Well, don't you look at me like that. You certainly wouldn't be in any danger. Mac: So they are in danger! Dennis Reynolds: No one's in any danger! Crazy credits The show's RCH production logo (now RCG) features an image of creators/stars Rob McElhenney, Charlie Day, and Glenn Howerton wearing hoodies and sunglasses. A sound clip plays backwards over the logo. In season 1 the clip says 'You are stupid for playing this forward' when reversed; in season 2 it says 'Is it brown? Is it brown? Good work. Is it brown? Is it brown?'; in season 3 it says 'Make it brown. Make it brown. Make it brown.' each actor chanting the words.
