Personal Quote: Musicals haven't done well because they haven't been in step with the time. They were the most popular form of movies in the late forties and fifties because they were being made about themes and subjects that actually concerned the movie-going audience. Annie (1982) or Hello, Dolly! (1969) didn't quite do that, I don't think. See more » Trivia: Father of Juno Temple. Trademark: Long, unbroken, Steadicam-shot sequences.
