Connections Featured in Jinek: Episode #4.10 (2016) Soundtracks Weak of Heart Written by Gustavo Santaolalla and Kevin Kiner Performed by Gustavo Santaolalla and Kevin Kiner User reviews462 Review Top review 10/10 Perfect portrait of the unreliability of the American Judicial System This was one of the most heartbreaking, inhumane and irrational criminal cases I came across in my entire life. You will find two major types of reviews in here: 1. The skeptic type, based on rational and logical analysis of all the evidence and framings towards Steven Avery and Brenden Dassen making them not guilty (attributing around 10/10 rating). 2. The emotional type, based on irrational and illogical analysis of all the speeches and horror stories the prosecution, the police and the media told the public making them guilty (attributing around 01/10 rating). This documentary series is constructed to favour the skeptic type (1). However, reality favoured the emotional type (2). Living the American nightmare, shall them say. Enjoy this highly unbiased masterpiece. helpful•72 14 pipo_brutal Aug 19, 2018 Details Edit Release date December 18, 2015 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Making a Murderer Part 2 Filming locations Manitowoc, Wisconsin, USA Production company Synthesis Films See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour Color Color Aspect ratio 1.78 : 1 Related news Pia Chaozon Barlow Upped To EVP Originals Marketing At HBO Max Nov 3Deadline Film + TV ‘On My Block’ Spinoff ‘Freeridge’ Sets Its New Core Four Oct 8Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What was the official certification given to Making a Murderer (2015) in Canada?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
