Here We Go Again Storyline Edit Following her release from prison, Debbie Ocean, younger sister of the late Danny Ocean, meets with her former partner-in-crime Lou to convince her to join a heist that she planned while serving her sentence. Debbie and Lou assemble the rest of their team: Rose Weil, a disgraced fashion designer who is deeply in debt with the IRS; Amita, a jewelry maker and friend of Debbie's who is eager to move out of her mother's house and start her own life; Nine Ball, a computer hacker; Constance, a street hustler and pickpocket; and Tammy, a profiteer and another friend of Debbie's who has been secretly selling stolen goods out of her family's suburban home. Debbie plans to steal the Toussaint, a $150 million Cartier necklace, from the Met Gala in three-and-a-half weeks, and use Met Gala co-host Daphne Kluger, a famous actress known for her long neck, as an unwitting mule who will wear the necklace into the gala. —mediaknite released from jailfemale protagonisthackervomitingdiamond necklace240 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Every con has its pros.

More like Ocean's Eh This movie lacked personality. You didn't get the character development that it needed. The heist was good but lacked suspense. It ended pretty abruptly. It could have used more humor. helpful•495 177 leooconnorjr Jun 8, 2018 Details Edit Release date June 8, 2018 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Official Site Languages English Hindi French German Mandarin Also known as 瞒天过海：美人计 Filming locations Arthur Kill Correctional Facility - 2911 Arthur Kill Road, Staten Island, New York City, New York, USA Production companies Warner Bros.
