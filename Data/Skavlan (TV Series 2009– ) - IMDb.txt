A year later, Skavlan continued with recordings from the same studio as The Graham Norton Show at The London Studios at ITV. During a season of Skavlan, about five out of twelve episodes are recorded from London. Connections Referenced in Drottningoffret: Episode #1.2 (2011) Soundtracks Oljerigg Performed by Fläskkvartetten User reviews2 Review Top review 9/10 Excellent Widefawning talk show I have seen 4 episodes October 2013. Very impressed of the hosts' ability to make very different people coming from all over the world tell their story and the speak with each other. I am usually a very momentary visitor at this kind of show because I am not interested in the hosts who are usually the main subject. Skavlan is keeping a low profile and seems to establish a surrounding that makes the guest feel confidence and then speak out without very much restraint. The guests I have encountered here are among others: Malala and her father, Bianca Jagger and "Morsan", an eightieths woman who for 17 years has taken care of Swedish and foreign prostitutes around Malmskillnadsgatan i Stockholm. Very much worth watching!! helpful•7 3 skovstrup Nov 3, 2013 Details Edit Release date January 17, 2009 (Norway) Country of origin Norway Official sites Facebook Official Site Languages Norwegian English Swedish Also known as Skavlan møter Sverige Production company Monkberry See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 58 minutes Color Color Related news Who Is Joel Kinnaman, The Star Of ‘Altered Carbon?’ Feb 1Uinterview Joel Kinnaman Says Sexual Misconduct Allegations Against ‘House Of Cards’ Co-Star Kevin Spacey ‘Wasn’t A Shock’ Jan 30ET Canada Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Skavlan (2009) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
