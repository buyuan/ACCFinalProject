Haven't been floored or thoroughly transported by a film since The Lord of the Rings until now. Dune is thrilling and emotionally authentic. The best part about the movie is that it takes it's audience seriously and does not just traps them into a cinematic odyssey but also takles the storyline critically. Performances are incredible especially Oscar Issac and young Timothée Chalamet. The movie is itself captivating and the visually breathtaking cinematography is God like.
