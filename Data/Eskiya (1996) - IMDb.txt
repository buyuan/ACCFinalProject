After serving 35 years, it is no surprise that the world has changed dramatically. Still, Baran can't help but be shocked to discover that his home village is now underwater thanks to the construction of a new dam. He then heads for Istanbul to get revenge upon his former best friend, the man who snitched on him and stole his lover Keje. Along the way, Baran teams up with Cumali, a tough young punk who finds the thief's old-fashioned ways rather quaint. When Cumali gets into deep trouble with a crime boss, Baran adds another vengeful task to his roster. —Anonymous cigarettebetrayalbanditmoneyprison27 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Crime Drama Thriller Certificate Not Rated Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia This movie is exclusively regarded as the savior and the turning point of the Turkish cinema which was desperately struggling against the foreign films since 1980 and having difficulty to attract the domestic audience. Goofs When the kid uses the binoculars, it's obviously the view of a camera and camera focuses to different objects and people fast. Adjusting the focus of those manual binoculars can only be made by a wheel and using a finger. It's not a fast process. Quotes Baran: [to Cumali, on the hotel rooftop] Don't be afraid, you will just go to soil, then you will become soil, then you will walk to the body of a flower with waters. From there, you will reach the essence. A bee will get to the essence of the flower. Maybe, maybe that bee will be me.

Nothing much new here, dredging up a lot of the usual gangster/revenge/fish out of water motifs, but it does a decent job of pulling you in and manages a certain freshness despite the familiarity of the material. Some of the larger dramatic scenes are painfully clichéd, but it's pieced together nicely and has some pretty good character moments. I get the feeling Turgul is a more talented director than a writer. Sener Sem (who I just realized was also in that lousy "Rascals" movie I recently watched) is a likable fellow, and his rapport with Ugur Yucel works well. Overall it's a somewhat mediocre film, but quite watchable with flashes of potential. helpful•19 13 MartinTeller Jan 12, 2012 Details Edit Release date November 29, 1996 (Turkey) Countries of origin Turkey France Bulgaria Language Turkish Also known as 强盗 Filming locations Sanliurfa, Turkey Production companies Artcam International Filma-Cass Geopoly See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget TRL 1,200,000 (estimated) See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 2 hours 8 minutes Color Color Sound mix Mono Aspect ratio 1.78 : 1 Related news 10 Roles Burt Reynolds Turned Down Nov 3ScreenRant.com 2021 VMA predictions: Our odds say Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion, Lil Nas X, and BTS will win big Sep 10Gold Derby Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Eskiya (1996) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
