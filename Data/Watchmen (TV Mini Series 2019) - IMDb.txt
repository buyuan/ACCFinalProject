Genres Action Drama Mystery Sci-Fi Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Second attempt at a Watchmen TV series. Terry Gilliam attempted an adaptation in the early 90s but could only conceive the story being so epic that the time it would take could only be accomplished on television rather than film. Gilliam's vision went into pre-production with HBO (as with this current one) & cast Robin Williams as Rorschach, Jamie Lee Curtis as Silk Spectre, Gary Busey as The Comedian, & Kevin Costner as Nite Owl. The project ultimately dissolved after HBO failed to provide a large enough budget for Gilliam's vision. Gilliam himself later claimed afterwards that an adaptation would've been "unfilmable" anyway. Goofs Throughout its entirety, characters are saying "calvary" instead of "cavalry" when referring to the Seventh Kavalry. Crazy credits Each episode title appears onscreen as a sign or in the background of a scene.

Trash. garbage once again and a complete waste of source material. It's boring and lacks a good story with characters that you actually give about. Don't waste your time. Watch Snyder's version instead. helpful•158 177 stefanfrederic Nov 10, 2019 FAQ6 Is this a sequel to the original graphic novel or a loose adaptation? Is this series canon to the movie? For those who know neither the film nor the source book, is this a show about superheroes taking down "bad guys" and/or supervillains?
