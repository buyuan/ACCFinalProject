The series takes place approximately three years after the last episode of Batman which ran on Fox. Dick Grayson has grown up taken the costumed identity of Nightwing, with Tim Drake taking over as Robin. —David J.

Genres Animation Action Adventure Crime Drama Family Mystery Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Many of the characters took on different designs for the series, most noticeably The Joker. Many fans of the previous series, "Batman: The Animated Series (1992)", had trouble accepting the new designs and as a result "The New Batman Adventures (1997)" is remembered more for the character designs than the episodes. Quotes Bruce Wayne: What are you doing tonight? Barbara Gordon: Same thing we do every night, Pinky! Bruce Wayne: What? Barbara Gordon: ...Never mind. Alternate versions Although this show goes by "Batman: The Animated Series Volume 4" on video, the original intro from "The New Batman/Superman Adventures" can be seen as a bonus feature if the viewer selects "Play All" on the DVD's main menu, in addition to the original BTAS intro. Connections Edited into Necessary Evil: Super-Villains of DC Comics (2013) User reviews37 Review Top review A disappointment The show is by and far worse than the previous Batman. The animation is much worse,the drawings lazy. All the new designs (except for the Scarecrow) are lazy, too square or too cartoonish. They cut corners with the coloring making everything black. The joker used to look so twisted and menacing, now he has no character. Tim is annoying and way too cartoonish, and Batman looks as if he was drawn entirely with a straight edge ruler. And would somebody please kill Batgirl? She has no pace here. helpful•11 25 Homeslice Jul 28, 1999 FAQ5 Who created the character of Batman? Bob Kane is listed in old (pre-2015) media including the comic books as creating Batman on his own but new media (made after 2015) shows him as co-creating the character with someone called Bill Finger, so what's all that about? Which hero characters were adapted from the Batman comic books? Which Villain characters were adapted from the comic books?
