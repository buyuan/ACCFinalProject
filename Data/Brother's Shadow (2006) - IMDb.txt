Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen are great as father and son. The film follows Scott Cohen from parole in Alaska back to his family in Brooklyn. He shows up there because his brother has died, and he embarks on a journey to slowly repair his estranged relationships with his brother's wife and child and his father who has never forgiven him for being the black sheep of the family. The story takes us deep into the hearts and minds of this family and allows you to more deeply understand the complexity of their lives. Also, the imagery of the woodworking business and the Brooklyn backdrop sets the tone for this rich and revealing family portrait. helpful•5 1 jessicalevin May 17, 2006 Details Edit Release date April 29, 2006 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Official site Language English Filming locations Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA Production companies Fish Six Film LLC Brother's Shadow LLP Mint Pictures See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $1,000,000 (estimated) See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 31 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
