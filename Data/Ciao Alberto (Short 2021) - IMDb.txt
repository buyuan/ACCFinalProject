Pixar loves to create 6 min shorts to entertain audiences of that movie and creating mini bits of storytelling to please fans. Great Short. ANIMATION STILL GORGEOUS. helpful•1 0 azeezsmith-61542 Nov 15, 2021 Details Edit Release date November 12, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Official Site Languages English Italian Also known as Чао, Альберто Filming locations Italian Riviera, Liguria, Italy Production companies Pixar Animation Studios Walt Disney Pictures See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $45,223 (estimated) See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 8 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 Related news Disney+ Day: All The Streamer’s Film & TV News From Premiere Dates To Series Orders Nov 12Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the English language plot outline for Ciao Alberto (2021)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
