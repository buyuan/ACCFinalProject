Frank, the Police Comissioner and son of former PC Henry Reagan, must balance his duties of running the largest police force in the world and being his kids' boss. His daughter Erin is an Assistant District Attorney, son Danny is a senior detective and fellow Marine Veteran, and new Harvard Law grad turned cop, Jamie all swirl through this family drama and passionately defend their city from harm. The Irish-American family is deeply rooted in their patriotism, passion, and love of family. —ahmetkozan new york police departmentfamily relationshipsbrother brother relationshipfather daughter relationshipfamily of cops18 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Genres Crime Drama Mystery Thriller Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Nearly each episode features a family dinner. This was at Tom Selleck's request to keep a sense of family. He also states that this scene is usually one of the longest ones to shoot. The family dinner happens always each Sunday around 17:00 to 17:30. Goofs Several police cars have forward facing blue lights. NYPD does not use forward facing blue lights on any emergency vehicle, and state law prohibits blue lights facing forward on police vehicles. Quotes Frank Reagan: I'm the PC. I know everything. Connections Featured in Late Night with Seth Meyers: Tom Selleck/Anne Heche/Marlon James/Kate Pierson (2015) User reviews263 Review Top review 8/10 Top notch cast The cast is first rate and the best thing about the show so far. Tom Selleck is maturing so well you almost forget about the youthful, carefree version of the actor. Today he carries a world weary, solid presence that makes him totally believable as Frank Reagan, the top cop of New York. The interactions between the younger Reagans are spot on and believable. Donnie Wahlberg and Bridget Moynahan in particular are interesting and move the stories along. The rest of the cast is fine with only Len Cariou's role giving a slightly false note, not because of the excellent veteran actor, but because someone thought it would be cool to give him a limp and a cane... hmmmm, a retired older Irish cop with a bum leg and a cane, sounds slightly familiar -- I keep expecting Daphne to appear saying it's time for his therapy. So far the stories have been solid one offs letting us get to know the lay of the land and the main characters personalities. The show is set in New York and the city is taking an important role. Thank goodness the producers didn't go with the Toronto as stand in for major US city route. I love Toronto, but it always messes with my suspension of disbelief when a car cruises pass a major landmark like the Empire State Building and ends up on Yonge street. We've been given heavy handed hints of the season's over arching story line -- the youngest Reagan is asked to infiltrate an inner circle of dirty cops called the Blue Templars. I've got a bad feeling about this one. Every time the story goes there it's just lame and brings reality crashing down with a discordant cacophony which jar this viewer out of the story line and makes him cringe. All and all, however, the series looks very good and if they build on the strengths of the great cast and compelling characters they should have a fine run (once they get the Blue Templars out of the way). helpful•57 28 smorrow2-1 Oct 18, 2010 FAQ4 Any word on when Season 11 will go into production and possible air dates? What does it mean when they say someone is "likely", generally its used when someone has been shot? Why are so many cops Irish?
