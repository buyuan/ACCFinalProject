User reviews63 Review Top review 8/10 Ashleigh/Zac and Ryan. I'm writing this simply to address a comment I saw. First off, the show is interesting even if some of the participants are frustratingly annoying. Ryan definitely gets undeserved hate. Why? Because he's intelligent, literate, well spoken, and self confident? Please. People are jealous. Period. He's level headed, focused, and determined. So he's sure of himself. He doesn't do it in a cocky way or a brash, hateful way. It's direct and to the point. On to the comment. Feels bad for Ashleigh and condemns Zac. Really? You're ignorant. She was instigating everything. He tried to get her mind off of things. He tried to have a conversation. He'd already been through it. She just wanted to be hateful because he wasn't babying her. Because she's an attention wh---. I guarantee that's why she went on the show. She was jealous Zac got "famous" and got positive accolades. He got attention. She wanted some. It's painfully obvious. Then to devalue his experience in war and say her "ordeal" was worse?? F that. She's an idiot. And I can't believe, unless she ate some humble pie and begged for forgiveness, that he stuck with that self centered b word. She berated him. She was nasty when he tried to have a simple, light hearted conversation. Obviously he tried more than they showed because at some point he mentioned emails. She didn't care. She even hated on him for trying to get a good job and career started for the family and doing a promotional thing (which was probably in his contract) for the show. People who put Zac down and don't point out her selfish, hateful attitude are probably as bad as she is. Sit down. helpful•3 0 chanfan304 Dec 2, 2020 Details Edit Release date March 10, 2016 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Official Facebook Official site Language English Also known as 60 Days In: Atlanta Filming locations Michael L.
