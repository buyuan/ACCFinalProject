Of course, any midnight horror movie is going to catch my attention and this happened to be one of the ones I really wanted to see. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to what I wanted it to be. Knocking follows a typical indie slow-burn about someone who may or may not be crazy. The movie tries to play smart, but we're all immune to any shock factor that comes our way. Everything is something we've seen before, yet I still found the movie entertaining. Cecilia Milocco gives a good performance that drives the whole thing. We know her history in mental health and an event that has scarred her which is fine for character development. My issue is because we know this, the whole time we're thinking she's crazy and hearing this. The end does play around with us leaving an ambiguous answer. For a 78-minute runtime it didn't feel all there, but maybe as a short this would've worked wonders. It's serviceable but nothing too special. helpful•8 5 sweidman-28016 Jan 30, 2021 Details Edit Release date November 5, 2021 (Sweden) Country of origin Sweden Official site Official Facebook Language Swedish Also known as Knocking Filming locations Norrköping, Östergötlands län, Sweden Production companies Läsk Sveriges Television (SVT) Swedish Film Institute See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 18 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 1.66 : 1 Related news “Let’s Look at the Color of Your Emotional Journey…” Director Frida Kempff on Her Immersive Psychological Thriller, Knocking Oct 29Filmmaker Magazine - Blog New to Streaming: Bergman Island, Dune, Titane, and More Oct 22The Film Stage Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Knackningar (2021) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
