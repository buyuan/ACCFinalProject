But when Sita is kidnapped by Ravana, king of the rakshasas, Rama must go deep into himself to find the physical and emotional resources he needs to rescue her. An idealized heroic tale about the struggle between good and evil, the Ramayana is also an intensely personal story of family relationships, love and loss, duty and honour, of harem intrigue, petty jealousies and destructive ambitions-all this played out in a universe populated by larger-than-life humans, gods and celestial beings, wondrous animals and terrifying demons. mythologyindian mythologyramsitakidnapping105 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Adventure Drama Family Musical War Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia After being initially rejected by Doordarshan due to perceived lack of interest in religious programming, the series quickly went on to become the most popular series in Indian television history, reaching over 100 million viewers each week. Its popularity reached a point of what the Indian news magazine India Today called "'Ramayan' fever", where religious services were rescheduled, buses, trains, and inter-city trucks were stopped, and shops would close every Sunday at 9:30 a.m. so that people would gather to watch the show. In villages, watching the show became a religious ritual unto itself. The show's popularity would remain the highest in history until a few years later, when Mahabharat (1988), also based on an ancient Hindu epic, would exceed its popularity. Alternate versions After the sequel series Luv Kush (1988) ended, both the series were aired combined as "Sampurna Ramayan". Connections Featured in Shri Krishna (1993) User reviews213 Review Top review 10/10 Best possible adaptation This was by far the best adaptation of Ramcharitra Manas. The cast was apt. Arun Govil as Lord Rama was great. His smile and expressions were enough to create the magic and persona of Lord Ram. helpful•16 4 ankushpratap Mar 31, 2020 FAQ2 WHAT IS THE MATTER ?
