Compelled to abduct three teenage girls led by the willful, observant Casey, Kevin reaches a war for survival among all of those contained within him -- as well as everyone around him -- as the walls between his compartments shatter. —alexanderfire-00074 multiple personality disorderpsychological thrillerkidnappingteenage girldissociative identity disorder332 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Kevin has 23 distinct personalities. The 24th is about to be unleashed. Genres Horror Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for disturbing thematic content and behavior, violence and some language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Inspiration for the film, real-life multiple-personality Billy Milligan (13th February 1955 - 12th December 2014), charged with three rapes, was the first person diagnosed with multiple personality disorder to use an insanity defence by reason of that disorder, and also first to be acquitted thus. Milligan had 24 personalities, consisting of 10 Desirables: Billy Milligan, Arthur, Ragen Vadascovinich, Allen, Tommy, Danny, David, Christene, Christopher, and Adalana; and 13 Undesirables: Phil, Kevin, Walter, April, Samuel, Mark, Steve, Lee, Jason, Bobby, Shawn, Martin, and Timothy; and The Teacher, a fusion of all of the other personalities. Goofs In the close-up shot of Dr. Fletcher's degree scroll from Tulane University, the school of political sciences is misspelled as "political scineces". In addition, her degree of Master of Psychology would not be awarded by a school of political sciences. Quotes The Beast: You are different from the rest. Your heart is pure! Rejoice! The broken are the more evolved. Rejoice. Crazy credits The end credits are shown in 24 frames in the background of the scrolling credits to simulate the 24 different personalities that Kevin has in the movie.

I gave him another chance after hearing so many people raving about this movie, and I'm glad I did. This is an excellently acted, directed and thought out movie. It's intense, funny at some parts, and it is incredibly well thought out. Don't listen to haters just because they don't like Shyamalan's movies. Check it out for yourself and make your own decision. helpful•200 106 BremenDruid May 13, 2017 Details Edit Release date January 20, 2017 (United States) Countries of origin United States Japan Official sites Official Facebook Page Official site Language English Also known as Untitled M.
