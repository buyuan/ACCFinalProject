Army CID detectives and ex-lovers Paul Brenner and Sara Sunhill are called in to investigate, and find themselves wrapped up in a maelstrom of sexual impropriety and misguided face-saving. —Jeff Cross <blackjac_1998@yahoo.com> armycover upmurderrapemilitary127 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Go behind the lies. Genres Crime Drama Mystery Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for graphic images relating to sexual violence including a strong rape scene, some perverse sexuality, nudity and language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The U.S. Army refused to endorse or have anything to do with the film's production. Goofs (at around 1h 50 mins) The 21 gun salute as the casket is loaded onto the C-123 Provider, would have never taken place at that time or place. The 21 gun salute takes place at the funeral in a cemetery. Quotes [Brenner finds out from Elby that Elisabeth Campbell isn't close to her father General Campbell] Sunhill: What about the General and Captain Campbell? Were they close? Capt. Jake Elby: No. Brenner: Why not? Capt. Jake Elby: I don't know. You like your dad? Brenner: My dad was a drunk, a gambler, and a womanizer. I worshipped him. Connections Featured in Siskel & Ebert & the Movies: Tarzan/Desert Blue/The General's Daughter/Run Lola Run (1999) Soundtracks She Began to Lie (Sea Lion Woman) Traditional Performed by Christine Shipp, Katherine Shipp User reviews299 Review Top review The Year's Most Offensive film Is rape "entertainment"? Director Simon West seems to think so. Here, there are 3 scenes of women being either raped, threatened with rape, and/or ASKING for rape (not to mention a LONG sequence with a naked body staked to the ground spread-eagled). Remember Simon West's last pic, CON AIR? There you had the touching site of Rachel Ticotin handcuffed to the plane and threatened with rape for about half the film (plus the lovely sequence of a child molester "playing" with a little girl). Now, of course, rape CAN be a suitable topic for a serious film, but A GENERAL'S DAUGHTER can never seems anything more than exploitation. Even as death, abuse and torture abound, Travolta and Madeline Stowe (why Ms.Stowe?) never are too concerned or busy not to take frequent time-outs to crack wise and have "witty" banter. If a more offensive and tasteless film is released this year, I hope I don't see it. helpful•7 7 gortx Jun 21, 1999 Details Edit Release date June 18, 1999 (United States) Countries of origin United States Germany Language English Also known as Con Gái Tướng Quân Filming locations Savannah, Georgia, USA Production companies Paramount Pictures Neufeld Rehme Productions MFP Munich Film Partners GmbH & Company I.
