Genres Drama Mystery War Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for some strong violence and language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia "Incendies" is French for conflagrations (or fires), but the film kept its French title in many countries, including the USA. In many countries, the title translates to "Incendies - The Woman Who Sings". Goofs In Nawal Marwan's passport the birth date shows 1949 in Latin script whereas in Arabic, it shows 1953. Quotes Simon Marwan: One plus one, does it make one? Crazy credits 'Mr. Leonard Cohen I need your help, please call me." - Denis Villeneuve Connections Featured in The Hour: Episode #7.83 (2011) Soundtracks You and Whose Army? Written by Colin Greenwood (as Colin C. Greenwood), Jonny Greenwood (as Jonathan RG. Greenwood), Ed O'Brien (as Edward J. O'Brien), Phil Selway (as Philip J. Selway), and Thom Yorke (as Thomas E. Yorke) Performed by Radiohead User reviews299 Review Top review 10/10 Unforgettable A bona fide masterpiece. As simple as that. It is ironic that one of the best films about the Middle East conflict, and specifically the tragic civil war in Lebanon, should be made by a Canadian film maker. Incendies is based on a play but it feels as though it has been adapted from a great literary work. In fact there is no specific mention of any country in the film but no one can be in any doubt that the unnamed country is Lebanon. A Canadain-Lebanese woman dies in Canada and in her will she leaves two letters to her twin son & daughter. One is to be delivered to their brother (whom they did not know existed) and the other to their father (whom they had presumed dead). To find these people they have to travel to Lebanon to unravel the mysterious past of their deceased mother. As we follow their search, flash backs slowly reveal to us key moments in the life of their mother. There are extremely powerful and unforgettable images and scenes in Incendies. Suffice to say that even if you have no interest in the history of the Middle East, this film will capture your attention from the start and grips you right till the end. It is the third great film (and arguably the best)that I've seen on this topic after Waltz with Bashir and Lebanon. All of these are essential viewing. helpful•317 66 corrosion-2 Oct 15, 2010 FAQ3 How old was Nawal when she had the 1st son and how old were the twins when she died?
