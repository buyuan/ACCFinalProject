As a result, a vicious Predalien hybrid, along with numerous Stage 1 Xenomorphs, or Face-huggers, scatter in all directions, infecting everyone unfortunate enough to cross their path. Once more, the Earth is a battlefield, as both extraterrestrial species are fighting for supremacy, and the humans become stuck in the middle. Now, the fate of the entire city rests in the hands of Sheriff Eddie Morales, and a handful of residents. Can they ensure the fate of humankind? —Nick Riganas predatorthe predator charactermurder of a pregnant womanextraterrestrialweapons fire160 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines This Christmas there will be no peace on Earth. Genres Action Horror Sci-Fi Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for violence, gore and language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia (At around five minutes) This is the first movie in both the Predator and the AVP-based movies, that features a scene of the Predators' home planet. Goofs (at around 1h 2 mins) In AVP: Alien vs. Predator (2004) it is clearly stated that it takes place on October 10th 2004.

These are June 3rd 2006 and September 23rd 2005. Quotes Dallas: All right, listen, whatever happens inside, the only person that can't get hurt is Kelly, all right? We all protect Kelly. Drew: What is this, the Titanic? Screw the women and children first shit, man. Dallas: Look, asshole, unless you can fly the helicopter, shut the fuck up. Crazy credits The opening title card features many sound effects from the previous movies, such as motion tracker beeps from Aliens, and the Predator POV humming.

You have good puppets, good cgi, good kills... why the heck did you shoot the entire film in the dark? I honestly thought that this could've been a great movie, but all of it was shot in the dark! I want to enjoy the kills and the alien and predator costumes, but I couldn't see crap, so I had to Lower the rating. If I could see what was happening, this movie would get a 9. helpful•38 2 ianweech May 19, 2021 FAQ31 Why would the Predalien wait for Wolf to get ready before attacking. What is 'AVP: Requiem' about? Remind me how 'AVP' ended.
