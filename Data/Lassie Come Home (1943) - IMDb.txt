Genres Adventure Drama Family Certificate Passed Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Dame Elizabeth Taylor replaced Maria Flynn in the role of Priscilla. Some sources say Flynn was afraid of the dog on the set; others say that she grew taller than Roddy McDowall or that the strong Technicolor lighting caused her eyes to water. In any case, production was halted. Producer Samuel Marx was walking the 600 block of North Foothill Road in Beverly Hills doing his nightly patrol as an air raid warden when he met Francis Taylor, who patrolled the 700 block. Knowing he and Sara Taylor wanted to get their daughter into the movies, he asked him to bring Elizabeth to the studio. There she was introduced to Lassie and the production resumed. Goofs While speaking about whether to keep Lassie or not it is obvious that the large hearth behind the elderly couple is a drop screen. Shadows from the lights show behind the couple from the viewer's left to right, but the shadows on the hearth shine from the opposite direction. Quotes Joe Carraclough: Ye're my Lassie come home.

"Lassie Come Home" is an incredibly well made and beautiful looking family film. It represents the best film of its kind MGM could make and is the best of the Lassie movies. And, although it's full of schmaltz, it's such well made schmaltz that just about everyone will enjoy the film if you give it a chance. When the film begins, the Carraclough family is in serious trouble. They're a poor English family and need money and so the father (Donald Crisp) decides to sell their one prized possession...their dog Lassie! Considering how his son adores the dog, and vice-versa, your heart breaks when little Roddy McDowell has to part with the pooch. What follows is escape after escape...and the dog amazingly is able to somehow find its way back home to the Carracloughs. Heartwarming...and a tear-jerker. All of the best qualities MGM could put into a film are stuffed into this one--loved color cinematography, very moody and fitting music, some wonderful supporting contract players (such as Edmund Gwen, Elizabeth Taylor and many others) and the MGM style all make this a sweet film and a must-see for everyone but the grouchiest viewers. helpful•13 1 MartinHafer Dec 14, 2016 FAQ8 What is 'Lassie Come Home' about?
