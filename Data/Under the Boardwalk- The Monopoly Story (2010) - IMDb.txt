I mean, how interesting could the game of Monopoly be? We went to see it on opening night in San Diego, and though we didn't realize it, were greeted at the door by one of the stars of the movie. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the documentary. It kept me entertained, and actually seemed to encourage audience participation. The movie had many interesting characters. I found the parts about the competitions especially interesting. At the end of the screening there was a Q&A period, and he had some of the past national champions there to answer questions. I thought it was a very good documentary. helpful•5 2 bunicula1 Mar 11, 2011 Details Edit Release date October 15, 2010 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Official site Language English Also known as Under the Boardwalk: A Monopoly Documentary Filming locations Acapulco, Guerrero, Mexico Production companies Tostie Productions Rhino Films Imageworks.tv See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross US & Canada $13,080 Opening weekend US & Canada $5,054 Mar 6, 2011 Gross worldwide $13,080 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 28 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 1.78 : 1 Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Under the Boardwalk: The Monopoly Story (2010) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
