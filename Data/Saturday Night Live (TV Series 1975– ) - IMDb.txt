(seventh season) Genres Comedy Music Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Seventeen-year-old Anthony Michael Hall was the youngest cast member. Goofs ...almost everything. Live television is largely exempt from the usual rules of goofs. Quotes George W. Bush: I'm gonna be around for a long time. On the job, making the tough decisions 24/7. That's 24 hours a week, 7 months a year. Alternate versions To avoid paying royalties, some syndicated versions remove the musical performances and the mention of the musical guests in the opening credits is also removed. Connections Edited into The Best of John Belushi (1985) User reviews311 Review Top review 6/10 Uneven but when it's good it's good. Saturday night live have been around for a good while now. The fact that the show have fostered many of the greatest comedians and writers should be recognized and celebrated. But due to the amount of episodes the show is very uneven. It spawned some of the best and most quotable comedy sketches but the bad ones outnumber them by a wide margin. The average grade is around 4/10 but you can't grade it without taking the contribution to comedy into account that raises the grade. But the show is not worth seeing every week. It's better to just see the good sketches on their YouTube page. helpful•9 0 anton_carlsson Sep 1, 2020 FAQ2 Are the full season sets available on DVD?
