Storyline Edit Bugs Bunny, the famous, Oscar-winning cartoon rabbit, hosts his first weekly television series, along with all his fellow Warner Brothers cartoon stars, including Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam, the Tasmanian Devil, Tweety Bird, Sylvester Cat, the Road Runner, Wile E. Coyote, Pepe Le Pew, Foghorn Leghorn, and Speedy Gonzales. Each episode features three theatrical cartoons introduced by Bugs and/or the other characters, and often with a unifying idea, or theme. Many episodes feature Bugs as a lecturer on such subjects as cats, dogs, birds, and humans, and offering classic Warner Brothers cartoon footage to comically illustrate his points. —Kevin McCorry <mmccorry@nb.sympatico.ca> 1960s1970sbugs bunny characteranimal character name as titletasmanian devil character17 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines What's up, Doc?

Written by Jerry Livingston, Mack David Performed by Mel Blanc User reviews14 Review Top review 10/10 The Greatest Animated Series Ever Produced "The Bugs Bunny Show" is just one of many television programs running Warner Bros. Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons. The Looney Tunes were, are, and will continue to be the most innovative and entertaining series of cartoons ever produced. These cartoons were a complete departure from what everyone else in the cartoon business was doing at the time. The Looney Tunes series was responsible for some of the greatest, funniest, and most sophisticated cartoons ever produced, as well as numerous memorable characters. Now, back to this television series. As I stated earlier, this was the first network television series to run Looney Tunes cartoons, and any show that runs Warner Bros. cartoons is definitely great. helpful•15 2 agj8012 Jun 10, 2010 Details Edit Release date October 11, 1960 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Mein Name ist Hase Filming locations Warner Brothers Burbank Studios - 4000 Warner Boulevard, Burbank, California, USA Production companies American Broadcasting Company (ABC) Warner Bros.
