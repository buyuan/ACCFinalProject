On a mission to rescue three stranded women from a planet no one has warned them about. Because no one has ever returned. Genres Action Adventure Sci-Fi Certificate PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia A number of the film's screenwriters were writers from Marvel Comics. Goofs The car-lot goof is often mentioned as "only visible in a work-print which was never released", but is VERY visible in many European VHS versions. When the spaceship lands, you can clearly see a street with cars in one of the corners. Quotes Chemist: Are they missing any limbs? I hate it when they have missing limbs. Alternate versions When originally released theatrically in the UK, the BBFC made cuts to secure a 'PG' rating. All cuts were waived in 1986 when the film was granted a '15' certificate for home video. Connections Featured in At the Movies: Spacehunter/Tough Enough/WarGames/Harlequin (1983) User reviews72 Review Top review 6/10 Better than a lot of movies currently churned out by Hollywood... I saw this in July, 2008 for the first time and was surprised by the amount of mechanical devices and vehicles built for this one. And the attention to detail is higher than many modern productions. A funny thing about making movies in 1983 is your choice of either using miniature models or constructing full scale behemoths. This movie goes for the latter option, which is one of its strengths, almost everything you see is right there and not some blue screened effect or shoddy computer graphics. This investment carries very well still today some 25 years later. It is like watching Road Warrior with all of the bikes, cars and trains and it all looks authentic because its actually there. Speaking of Road Warrior, it must be said that Spacehunter has an apparent look and feel of a post-apocalyptic desert world similar to that of the Mad Max films. Striking are the interesting locations which are thrown at the viewer at a fast pace where new environments show up around every corner during their hunt in the forbidden zone. While short scenes in themselves, they come together nicely in creating the feel of a good adventure movie reminiscent of the Indiana Jones movies. Not sure of the budget here, many things look really nice, some space scenes are awful but very, very short. I've mentioned two series of other films in this review, don't expect to find either one of them in Spacehunter, rather expect to find elements of all of them combined. helpful•26 6 medusa-41 Jul 3, 2008 Details Edit Release date May 20, 1983 (Canada) Countries of origin United States Canada Official site Sony Movie Channel (United States) Language English Also known as Spacehunter Filming locations Potash Pond Overlook, Dead Horse Point State Park, Utah, USA Production companies Columbia Pictures Delphi I Productions Zone Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $14,400,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $16,478,265 Opening weekend US & Canada $7,053,016 May 22, 1983 Gross worldwide $16,478,265 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 30 minutes Sound mix Dolby Related news Drive-In Dust Offs: Sweet Sixteen (1983) Nov 9DailyDead Horror Highlights: Exhumed Films’ 35mm Marathon, Escape Room, Paperbacks From Hell, Godzilla Faq, Ghastlies, Mountain Fever Aug 15DailyDead Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone (1983) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
