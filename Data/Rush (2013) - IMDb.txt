The story follows their distinctly different personal styles on and off the track, their loves and the astonishing 1976 season in which both drivers were willing to risk everything to become world champion in a sport with no margin for error: if you make a mistake, you die. —P.

Mr. Ron Howard is a great story teller, this movie is about human nature, love and tears. It is difficult to make a good movie about car racing, especially to make one for the time period from 1970 to 1976. I don't know how they did it to bring those old F1 cars back to life. You will feel like you are really there watching the racing, it's really unbelievable. It is truly touching to see each character played their perfect role for this movie, Chris Hemsworth did a great performance, he is such a talented and devoted actor. Daniel Brühl also did a great job on portraying the eccentric and unsociable legendary F1 driver Niki Lauda. A great movie is like having a great meal, a good starter, a good soup/salad, a good main course and a good dessert, well balanced. Rush is that good meal, it's a fun ride! I have to say I really enjoyed watching this movie. Thank you Mr. Ron Howard for making this masterpiece. helpful•224 39 joechang-1 Sep 13, 2013 FAQ2 What filming techniques were used to capture the 'Rush' of driving a Formula 1 Racing Car?
