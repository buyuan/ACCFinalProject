One of the best fantasy television shows I've seen in a while. They did a great job of developing the side characters and building up the larger political dynamics at play, while also giving time to the main characters and their relationships. helpful•399 129 rayooyeyemi Apr 26, 2021 FAQ3 Is the deer in the series inspired by the one in Princess Mononoke?
