Storyline Edit More than a decade after the original series went off the air, Netflix reboots the "Queer Eye" franchise with a new Fab Five and a new setting, trading in the concrete jungle of New York City for communities in and around Atlanta. The style experts forge relationships with men and women who often have different beliefs from them, leading to moments of social commentary interspersed with style advice. Advising people in need of lifestyle makeovers are food and wine specialist Antoni Porowski, interior designer Bobby Berk, grooming consultant Jonathan Van Ness, fashion designer Tan France and culture expert Karamo Brown, who reality TV fans may recognize as one of the housemates on "The Real World (1992): Philadelphia." David Collins, who created the original Queer Eye for the Straight Guy (2003) show, is on board as an executive producer. —Jwelch5742 gaylgbtfashionhome renovationdiy13 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genre Reality-TV Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia As recently as 2017, Antoni Porowski was an aspiring actor from Montreal who made a living as the personal chef and assistant to his neighbor Ted Allen, the original "Queer Eye" foodie.

Jonathan Ness makes every gray or sad day shine bright like the sun. He alone is worth giving the show ten stars. But all five of this heart warming, kind, smart, handsome and caring guys make pure magic out if this show. Me and my ten year old daughter always watch this together, and we smile, cry, laugh, hug and cry again. We have been through a lot and this show is like medicine for our souls.
