Blue Planet ll focuses more heavily on mankind's influence on the world's oceans through both global pollution and climate change. This series features a variety of revolutionary segments never before seen in a video documentary, including: cuttlefish that hypnotize crabs to stun them, giant trevally that leap out of the water to catch low flying birds, and newly discovered dancing yeti crabs. —Jakob E.

Connections Edited into Universum: Unser Blauer Planet - Magie der Meere (2018) User reviews46 Review Top review 9/10 An Enthralling Masterpiece From space, astronauts describe the earth as a magnificently bluish sphere, standing out against a dark backdrop. The earth is an inspiring gift bestowed on us human beings to appreciate the nature, the animals, the oceans and the universe. Oceans constitute a major part of this gift, showcasing a vast spectrum of glorious animals and a boundless array of phenomena. These animals are the gems festooning the oceans, living harmoniously together, creating vast treasure troves for us to behold and ponder over, to take delight in discovering. The oceans are the arteries of life pulsating throughout the Planet Earth, reminding us of the splendor and also fragility of rainbow of life hanging majestically over the Earth. This stunning series awakens in us the respect for life and the gift given to us, reminding us of how enchanting oceans are and the animals that make a large and beautiful part of this awesome Life on earth. I hope more people, more politicians, more religious zealots are brought to watch series like this to appreciate and respect the glory of life on Planet Earth and in the Blue Planet. It may cast a spell on them to stop the destruction of this magnificent life, as it did on me watching it. I once again bow to the people involved in the creation of this sparkling diamond of a documentary and wish that Sir David Attenborough live for many years to mesmerize us with his iconic narration and voice. helpful•16 4 farshidkarimi Nov 2, 2017 Details Edit Release date October 29, 2017 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Language English Also known as Блакитна планета 2 Production companies BBC Natural History Unit (NHU) BBC Studios OceanX Media See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 6 hours 4 minutes Sound mix Dolby Digital Related news ‘Vigil’ Breaks Three-Year UK Ratings Record; Collective Media Group Pushes Into LatAm; BBC Earth YouTube Channel Hits 10m Subs Mark – Global Briefs Oct 5Deadline Film + TV ‘Planet Earth’ Producer Jonny Keeling to Head BBC Natural History Unit (Exclusive) Sep 6Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Spanish language plot outline for Blue Planet II (2017)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
