User reviews12 Review Top review The price of greatness: an unlikely underdog story Must-see for foodies, food lovers and friends -- this cinematic gem is also a film for those that love a great underdog story. And Jake's an unlikely underdog - a culinary rockstar, a creative genius, defying conventions in his underground restaurant... when he and his wife Alexa take the leap of a lifetime to launch their restaurant, 42 GRAMS. Fascinating, fun to watch, and also heartbreaking. Moved me to tears. A compelling glimpse at the creative process of a brilliant chef and artist, at life behind one of the best restaurants in the world, and what it takes to sustain that -- told honestly and without pretension. Gorgeous cinematography brings the food off the plate and accessible to the audience in a way that no other doc - film or TV - has managed before. helpful•5 5 katherine-obrien Nov 13, 2017 Details Edit Release date October 8, 2017 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Official site website of the director Language English Also known as Courses Filming locations Chicago, Illinois, USA Production company ZAXIE See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 22 minutes Color Color Related news Podtalk: Rebecca Fons & Jack C.
