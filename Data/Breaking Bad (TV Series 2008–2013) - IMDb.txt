He lives with his teenage son, who has cerebral palsy, and his wife, in New Mexico. Determined to ensure that his family will have a secure future, Walt embarks on a career of drugs and crime. He proves to be remarkably proficient in this new world as he begins manufacturing and selling methamphetamine with one of his former students. The series tracks the impacts of a fatal diagnosis on a regular, hard working man, and explores how a fatal diagnosis affects his morality and transforms him into a major player of the drug trade. —WellardRockard, jackenyon canceralbuquerque new mexicochemistrymethamphetaminedrug142 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines In the no-holds-barred world of Walt White, the end justifies the extreme. (season 2) Genres Crime Drama Thriller Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Jesse Pinkman was originally slated to be written out by the 9th episode. During the hiatus caused by the writers' strike, creator Vince Gilligan, impressed by Aaron Paul's portrayal of Jesse, decided to reinstate the character. Goofs In the opening credits letters in the names are highlighted in green so as to represent a chemical element symbol. However, Michael Slovis, the Director of Photography, for several of the beginning episodes, they highlight the Ch. There is no chemical element symbol Ch. After a number of episodes they caught it and thereafter they only highlighted the C. Quotes Walter White: Who are you talking to right now? Who is it you think you see? Do you know how much I make a year? I mean, even if I told you, you wouldn't believe it. Do you know what would happen if I suddenly decided to stop going into work? A business big enough that it could be listed on the NASDAQ goes belly up. Disappears. It ceases to exist, without me. No, you clearly don't know who you're talking to, so let me clue you in. I am not in danger, Skyler. I AM the danger. A guy opens his door and gets shot, and you think that of me? No! I am the one who knocks! Crazy credits Opening credits use chemical symbols from the periodic table of elements as part of names : bromine (Br), and barium (Ba) for the title, none for creator Vince Gilligan (except when he gets a V for Vanadium), one for cast and crew members. Alternate versions All episodes were rerun on an on-demand cable channel in some areas, without commercials but with additional scenes not included on AMC.
