The timing parallels Universal’s 31-day strategy for films that open over $50 million. As anticipated, the latest James Bond immediately placed #1 on multiple charts, both those ranking by transactions and revenue (Vudu). The film remained at #4 in theaters over the weekend, with a 23 percent drop the second lowest among top 10 films. Once again, the home-viewing marketing push also appeared to benefit ticket sales. Disney is #2 and #3 across the board, as represented by “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings” ($19.99) and “Free Guy” ($5.99), respectively. Four other Disney titles, led by “Jungle Cruise” ($12.99) and “Black Widow” ($5.99), took 10 of the 30 positions on the charts. More impressive is that all but “Free Guy” now stream free for Disney + subscribers.
