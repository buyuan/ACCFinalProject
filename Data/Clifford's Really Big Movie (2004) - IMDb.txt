A carnival act called "Larry's Amazing Animals" has just been in town, and the animals in the show told Clifford about an animal contest with a prize of a lifetime supply of Tummy Yummies. So he decides to run away along with Cleo and T-Bone, join the carnival act, win the contest, and bring the food back. Soon Clifford is the star of the show, and Shackleford the ferret, who'd always been the star, gets jealous. Clifford just wants to help and win the contest -- but getting back home to Emily Elizabeth may not be as easy as he thinks, even after the contest is over. —Sarah Elisabeth animal character name in titlefour word titlewarner brosvizslared5 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Get ready for Clifford's Biggest, Reddest, Most Amazing Movie!

She loves dogs in general but the bright red fur of Clifford and the music make her happy and the lessons that Clifford and his friends teach make us happy. It's an adorable movie that anyone should show their preschooler. If you like Clifford or animated dogs, this movie should definitely be in your collection. There's comedy, thrills, and an infinite amount of fun in this movie. It is very child friendly, there are no uncomfortable scenes that could make a parent question the value of this movie and the lesson of not judging people based on looks is one of the unspoken central themes of both the show and the movie. helpful•3 1 abarel13 Jul 27, 2010 Details Edit Release date April 23, 2004 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Scholastic Language English Also known as Cliffords riktigt stora film Production companies Big Red Dog Productions Scholastic Productions Mike Young Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $70,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $2,922,354 Opening weekend US & Canada $662,152 Apr 25, 2004 Gross worldwide $3,255,426 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 14 minutes Color Color Sound mix DTS Dolby Digital SDDS Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Clifford Movie Teaser Reveals the Iconic Big Red Dog Nov 25MovieWeb ‘Bold And The Beautiful’ Is Bringing On A New Male For A Fulltime Role Nov 4OnTheFlix Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Clifford's Really Big Movie (2004) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
