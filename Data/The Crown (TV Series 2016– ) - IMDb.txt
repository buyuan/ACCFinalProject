The British Empire is in decline, the political world is in disarray, but a new era is dawning. Peter Morgan's masterfully researched scripts reveal the Queen's private journey behind the public façade with daring frankness. Prepare to see into the coveted world of power and privilege behind the locked doors of Westminster and Buckingham Palace. —Netflix queenroyal familybritish monarchyfemale protagonistqueen of england30 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Change Will Challenge Tradition Genres Biography Drama History Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The series is one of the most expensive television series ever made. Each episode is budgeted at £5 million and it had already been commissioned for two seasons, with the intention of four more, before the first episode had even been completed, or any episode broadcast. Goofs In reality the Queen and Princess Margaret were almost the same height. Whilst Claire Foy is of similar height to the Queen, Vanessa Kirby (Princess Margaret) is almost 4 inches taller. In a scene of them walking together, Kirby has flat shoes to offset the height difference. Connections Featured in The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon: Anna Kendrick/John Lithgow/Iliza (2016) User reviews721 Review Top review 10/10 Wow! Tremendous series and the period details are painstaking and luscious I watched with bated breath as Olivia Coleman took over from Claire Foy. Coleman embodies a mature Elizabeth, one who is calcified into a Royal with a stoic countenance, dowdy wardrobe, and a hint of what the crown has given and cost her. What really blew me away was the lavish attention to detail and period. The public and private spaces are painted in luscious colors, the furniture upholstered with richly hued brocade (so are the women come to think of it). The salons and libraries decorated with massive wood furniture. It's not comfortable - you can almost feel the drafty cold circulating throughout the palace, but it is a showstopper. No wonder they wore wool sweaters and tartan wool suits while lounging about. helpful•57 11 mccann3010 Nov 20, 2019 "The Crown" Stars Through the Years "The Crown" Stars Through the Years Take a look back at the careers of the cast, in photos.See the entire gallery Photos FAQ2 How are Elizabeth II and Philip related before their marriage?
