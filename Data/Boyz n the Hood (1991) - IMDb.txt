Half-brothers Doughboy (Ice Cube) and Ricky Baker (Morris Chestnut) are foils for each other's personality, presenting very different approaches to the tough lives they face. Ricky is the "All-American" athlete, looking to win a football scholarship to USC and seeks salvation through sports, while Doughboy succumbs to the violence, alcohol, and crime surrounding him in his environment, but maintains a strong sense of pride and code of honor. Between these two is their friend Tre Styles (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), who is lucky to have a father, Furious Styles (Laurence Fishburne), to teach him to have the strength of character to do what is right and to always take responsibility for his actions. —Tad Dibbern <DIBBERN_D@a1.mscf.upenn.edu> gangstawalking on train tracksdead bodyafrican american protagonistviolence283 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Once upon a time in South Central L.A. ... It ain't no fairy tale. Genres Crime Drama Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for language, violence and sensuality Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia To maintain a sense of realism, writer and director John Singleton never warned the actors and actresses about when shots would be fired. Their reactions were real. Goofs Tre is given, by Furious, the tedious job of raking the leaves off of his lawn. There is, however, no tree evident in supporting shots or surrounding lawns to indicate where the leaves had come from. Quotes Furious Styles: Any fool with a dick can make a baby, but only a real man can raise his children. Crazy credits After the epilogue of what happens to Doughboy and Tre, the words "Boyz n the Hood: Increase the Peace" appears onscreen Alternate versions The Criterion Collection laserdisc features two scenes deleted from the theatrical version. They are as follows: Tre and his mother have a telephone conversation about his future with Brandi and college. Doughboy has a confrontation with Furious after Ricky gets shot.

John Singleton's best film also proved to be one of my favorite movies about life in the streets. Cuba Gooding, Jr. displayed early on he was going to be a respectable actor. The power of the film has yet to be matched as most modern interpretations of street life prove to be violent stylizations. While Singleton has taken a couple missteps along the way, this film still stands up rather well by today's standards. The motives and actions appear realistic, especially Doughboy's thirst for revenge. A good film, which not only helped improve Laurence Fishburne's career, but introduced us to Gooding. helpful•71 13 Agent10 May 22, 2002 Details Edit Release date July 12, 1991 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Boys in the Hood Filming locations 5918 Cimarron Street, Los Angeles, California, USA Production company Columbia Pictures See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $6,500,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $57,504,069 Opening weekend US & Canada $10,023,462 Jul 14, 1991 Gross worldwide $57,529,070 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 52 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Stereo Dolby Atmos Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Regina King’s Career to Be Cemented at Imprinting Ceremony Oct 28Variety Film + TV Our Kind of People's Morris Chestnut Previews Dirty-ish Turn on Fox Sudser: 'I Want People to Grab Their Popcorn' Sep 21TVLine.com Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Boyz n the Hood (1991) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
