Genres Action Adventure Drama Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for sequences of intense destruction and peril, and language including some sexual references Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Some people have questioned whether or not a strong tornado could actually lift an aircraft like a 747 as depicted in the movie. Tornadoes have been known to pick up railroad engines before. An SD40-2 locomotive which is an average sized locomotive weighs 368,000 lbs. An empty 747-400 weighs 393,000 lbs, so there is not that great of a weight difference. Also, the wings would make the 747 more aerodynamic than the dead weight of a locomotive. So theoretically it would be possible for a 747 to be picked up by a strong tornado. Goofs At the end of the movie in the drain the wind blows in the same direction before and after the eye. After the eye the direction should be reverse. Quotes Gary: That was good thinking with that knife back there. Trey: I thought you'd be mad. Gary: Oh I am. Hand it over.

Records Inc. By arrangement with Warner Music Group Film & TV Licensing User reviews279 Review Top review 6/10 Worth it just for the Tornado scenes. Into the Storm was not a movie I had a lot of expectations for. I just wanted to have fun seeing huge tornadoes destroying everything in their path. And that's what I got for the most part in this movie. The first 15 minutes of this movie was so bad, the dialogue was atrocious, the characters were annoying and the writing was completely abysmal. But as the movie starts to show more of the tornadoes, it got really fun really quick. the movie got so much better. One of the best aspects of this movie is how close you really get into the tornadoes. You go inside it and it looks frightening and beautiful at the same time. The visuals look amazing when you're in the movie theater. This is definitely a movie that should be seen in your nearest theater, because it was such an experience seeing the tornadoes, hearing the train-like noise when a tornadoes comes barreling towards the cities and cars. It's just so awesome. One of the weakest aspects of this movie are the characters, we just don't care what happens to them in the movie. But the tornadoes are terrific and they keep coming on at you every twenty minutes or so for two hours. Now this can be a little tiresome, but "Into the Storm" does stop itself just in time before it completely overstays its welcome. In the end, it's not a very good movie by any stretch of the imagination. Again, this is the film that one will either like as a guilty pleasure, like me, or you won't care for it at all. And even if you do like the movie, there is still one big lapse in the whole thing that you realize at the end. If tornadoes really did show up as often as they do in the movie in the same general area, there would be nothing left standing in the Midwest anymore. It would all be leveled. helpful•92 63 Loving_Silence Aug 5, 2014 Details Edit Release date September 12, 2014 (China) Country of origin United States Official sites Official site Official site (Germany) Language English Also known as Category 6 Filming locations Detroit, Michigan, USA Production companies Broken Road Productions New Line Cinema RatPac-Dune Entertainment See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $50,000,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $47,602,194 Opening weekend US & Canada $17,346,427 Aug 10, 2014 Gross worldwide $161,502,194 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 29 minutes Color Color Sound mix SDDS Datasat Dolby Digital Dolby Atmos DTS Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Emmy Predictions 2021: Best Actor in a Limited Series — A Classic Race with a Bit More Meaning Aug 9Indiewire Fear The Walking Dead S6 Shambles to Disc Aug. 31 Jul 16Comicmix.com Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
