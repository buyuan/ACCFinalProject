Selina Meyer is fond of saying. Unfortunately, the people Meyer, a charismatic leader and rising star in her party, meets after becoming vice president are nothing like she expected, but everything she was warned about. "Veep" follows the new VP as she puts out political fires, juggles her public schedule and private life, and does everything within her limited powers to improve her dysfunctional relationship with the chief executive. Meyer's trusted -- and some not-so-trusted -- aides include chief of staff Amy, spokesperson Mike, secretary Sue and right-hand man Gary. —Jwelch5742 female protagonistone word series titlethe white housecover uppresident31 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines The buck stops somewhere near here. Genre Comedy Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Every scene is rehearsed with the actors improvising things to make it funnier if possible. This whole process is observed by the writers, who take notes of the improvisations they feel work and incorporated to the shooting scripts. Quotes Selina Meyer: I'm the Vice President of the United States, you stupid little fuckers! These people should be begging me! That door should be half its height so that people can only approach me in my office on their goddamn, motherfucking knees! Connections Featured in The Tonight Show with Jay Leno: Episode #20.154 (2012) User reviews151 Review Top review 10/10 excellent Like the rest of Ianucci's work, this is a fantastic political satire. The reflexive self-serving sycophancy, the arbitrary nature of power, the automatic deferral to the hidden powers behind the throne, the elevation of random dross above real issues (brilliantly lampooned in the pilot when the use of cornstarch forks in the White House becomes a stumbling block to setting up a clean jobs task force) are skillfully portrayed, showing how the dysfunction of the modern arena (especially the media's eye, usually passive but, as in the second episode, sometimes accompanied by a mouthful of vicious teeth) prevents the exercise of power for actual governmental function. None of the characters are perfectly likable, though all are well-played, but somehow the ensemble is endearing. Watch this if you want to see a sharp commentary on the drunken carousel that is politics. helpful•70 18 rednblack May 10, 2012 FAQ2 What political party does Selina Meyer represent?
