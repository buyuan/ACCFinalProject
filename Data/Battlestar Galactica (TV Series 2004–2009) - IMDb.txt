Now Commander Adama of the Battlestar Galatica and President Laura Roslin lead a ragtag fleet of refugees in a supposed search for the fabled lost thirteenth colony, Earth. However, the dangers they face are many, which compound an already difficult situation. In addition to the Cylons hunting and attacking the fleet in space and their infiltrator units carrying out sabotage--even as their former unwitting pawn, Gaius Baltar, helps in the hunt for them while hiding both his own guilt and the strange presence that haunts his every thought--the fleet also faces internal political conflict in which the rabble-rousing figure Tom Zarek is merely the loudest dissenting voice, not to mention recurring shortages of food, water, and even oxygen. In the midst of these trials, however, clues begin to appear to suggest that Adama's bluff about finding Earth might hold more truth than anyone could have guessed. —Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) human in outer spacenuclear weapontotalitarianismprophecyspace opera140 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines The fight to save humanity rages on. Genres Action Adventure Drama Sci-Fi Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The phrase "so say we all", which is used as a ceremonial affirmation in the series, was ad-libbed by Edward James Olmos in a speech given by Commander Adama in the mini-series. Goofs The colony called Sagittarion in the miniseries is called Sagittaron throughout the series. Quotes Commander William Adama: There's a reason you separate military and the police. One fights the enemies of the state, the other serves and protects the people. When the military becomes both, then the enemies of the state tend to become the people.

Connections Edited into Hollywood Burn (2006) User reviews801 Review Top review The new Battlestar Galactica is a stunning drama that surpasses the original 70's cheese. The two Battlestar Galactica series both begin in the same way with similar precepts  the end of a civilisation and the possible extinction of the human species. The original chose to be lightweight in dealing with this underlying theme (the first thing they do post-apocalypse is go to a party planet) - the new series actually attempts to deal with the issue in an adult manner. The writing, direction, and most importantly the acting, is superb - each combining to create emotional depth. As a teen I enjoyed the original but (sorry to get Biblical) "when I was a child I spoke as a child, I acted as a child  now I must put childish things behind me". The sex of the characters does not offend  it does not cause grief to find two key characters to be stunningly female. It doesn't even offend that a potential bad guy has a British accent. Just enjoy. Drama really doesn't get much better than this. helpful•480 482 tony-goodwin Feb 6, 2005 FAQ7 Is it "frak", "frakk", "frack", or "fraak"? I never could figure out what the correct spelling of that expletive was. does the action ever pick up? ive only watched the first 2 episodes but i found them pretty slow and boring Is this a remake of the 1978 television show?
