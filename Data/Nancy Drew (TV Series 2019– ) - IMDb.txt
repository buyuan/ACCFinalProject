The restaurant where 90% of the show takes place, is open and serving people food from an absolutely filthy kitchen! Why TF would anyone eat out of there? Even the outside is falling to pieces, yet the owner is super wealthy! The show is a great time waster, nothing too serious happening. Worth a watch but sort out that dodgy restaurant! helpful•7 1 popsalicious Jun 21, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 9, 2019 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Official Facebook Official Instagram Language English Also known as Ненсі Дрю Filming locations Horseshoe Bay, West Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada Production companies Warm Blooded Sunday Productions Furious Productions CBS Television Studios See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 44 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news The CW 2021-22 TV Season Ratings (updated 11/16/2021) Nov 16TVSeriesFinale.com Nancy Drew: Season Three Ratings Nov 13TVSeriesFinale.com Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What was the official certification given to Nancy Drew (2019) in Spain?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
