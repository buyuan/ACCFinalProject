Most of the times, the creators, are trying to satisfy every viewer and they end up satisfy nobody. Lost is one of the few series that justify the creators intentions. It has it all. Mystery, drama, action, adventure, comedy, fantasy and many many twists. It also has an amazing score and an incredible cast. Most of the actors were literality unknown at that point of their career. I haven't seen a series with so well written characters and stories. Lost's most iconic character is John Locke whom I personaly find the greatest character in TV's history (especialy in season1). Most of the viewers complain about series finale while they didn't even understand what happend. For me the finale is great and touching and fulfill with an increadible way the character's story. The problem is in last season which has some weaknesses and it isn't as great as the previous ones but it surely is worth watching. I personaly believe that Lost is the best and most fulfill series ever made.

The film centers on a comedic lawyer and his loudmouth gorgeous wife. His mission is to set free two kids who injust accused for murder (one of the kids is his cousin). He always screw things up. His wife tries to help him, but he always sents her off, until he realise he need her help. The movie gave Marisa Tomei an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She made the performance of her lifetime alongside Joe Pesci who was amazing as well. The movie wouldn't be so good if it wasn't for these actors. There are great comedic scenes that will cheer you up. The final act of the film is truly unforgetable and was the one that gave Marisa her Oscar, an Oscar she fully deserved. The movie is acclaimed by both critics and public. In my opinion it deserves a place in IMDb's Top 250 movies.

Althoughthe movie has lack of dialogueit delivers some of the best action sequences in cinema's history. If you love the battles in Lord of the Rings trilogy you would love this as well. The score is amazing. The cast includes great actors like Eric Bana, Brian Cox, Brendan Gleeson, Diane Kruger, Orlando Bloom, Garrett Hedlund, Sean Bean, Julie Christie, Vincent Regan, Rose Byrne and of course Brad Pitt who steals the show as usual. He portrayes the Greek demigod Achilles son of Peleus and Thetis. He considered as the greatest warrior ever lived. He wants to be remembered for that, that's why he decides to join his fellow Greeks to Troy. The thing that I like most in this movie is that it dosen't choose sides. There is no good and evil like most of the movies. Every character has his own motive in this war. Unfortunately it is not considered as great as Gladiator, Breveheartor Lawrence of Arabia but I find it highly underrated. It's one of the first movies I have ever seen and it holds a very special place in my heart for that. Highly underrated movie.

I consider The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring not only the best LOTR movie but the best film of all time. The movie has much better cohesion from the sequels. It also has a far more organized screenplay. The story begins with two heroes, who later became four, then five, then nine and then the journey begins. The dangers are so many you need to hold your breath. There are deadly mountains, thunders, the mines of Moria, a place that has been held by the enemy, monsters, a sword-wielding fire demon called Balrog, Galadriel the Argonath, the death of some members and the break of the fellowship. I like that the heroes are all together instead of the sequels who are seperated. Also the movie has the greatest leitmotif in cinema's history. Every character, place and race has a theme of it's own. You hardly grasp the importance of music in film. It's an invisible layer of pure emotion that guides us or challenge us, or guides or challenges the drama itself. One other thing that this movie has and the other two don't is Sean Bean's character, Boromir which I find the most intresting character of the trilogy. His character in the end finds redemption and in my eyes it's the most heroic death I have ever seen. The ending is heartbreaking and it's surely one to remember. The movie's shooting began in 1999 and the CGI are better from movies like The Hobbit trilogy which is made almost 15 years later. That proves that practical effects are better that computers. It's been 20 years since 2001 and this trilogy has age perfectly. It's wthout a doupt the greatest fantasy movies of all time and no matter how many years will pass these movies will not been forgotten.

David Fincher is one of the most talented film directors of his generation. When people talk about him, they usually brought up Fight Club, Se7en or The Social Network. But personally, I always found The Game to be his very best. The Game is a terrific moody thriller with a very intelligent and unpredictable plot. Michael Douglas delivers a very strong performance and is perfect for the lead role. Deborah Kara Unger, Sean Penn and James Rebhorn are also pretty great in their roles too. It's a truly great film, very entertaining and very underrated, highly recommended.
