Genres Biography Drama History War Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for brutal medieval warfare Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Mel Gibson initially turned down the role of William Wallace, as he felt he was too old for the part. However, Paramount Pictures would only finance the film if Gibson played the lead role, so he agreed. Goofs During the last battle, two soldiers just stop fighting and laugh at what is going on. Quotes William Wallace: Every man dies, not every man really lives. Crazy credits With the exception of the title of the movie, there are no opening credits. Alternate versions When the film was originally released, the final voice over tells us that the Scots "won their freedom... forever." The "forever" was deleted for the re-release and other future editions. It can still be found, however, in the liner notes of the soundtrack album.

Mel Gibson didn't just star in this movie but directed and produced. No one will ever forget... Run, and you'll live... at least a while. And dying in your beds, many years from now, would you be willin' to trade ALL the days, from this day to that, for one chance, just one chance, to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll never take...
