It addresses issues such as personal identity and freedom, democracy, education, scientific progress, art and technology, while still remaining an entertaining drama series. Over seventeen episodes we witness a war of attrition between the faceless forces behind 'The Village' (a Kafkaesque community somewhere between Butlins and Alcatraz) and its most strong willed inmate, No. 6. who struggles ceaselessly to assert his individuality while plotting to escape from his captors. —Stuart Berwick <berws@essex.ac.uk> 1960sprisonsecretnumberbritish88 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines No Man Is Just A Number. Genres Drama Mystery Sci-Fi Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The Prisoner was filmed in the North Wales resort village of Portmeirion over the course of a year. Patrick McGoohan was inspired to film his series there after filming a couple of Danger Man (1960) episodes in the village. Goofs In the opening sequence, the letter X is typed across the prisoner's photograph, but the typewriter typebar for the letter H is moving. The typebar for the letter X is at the far right of the frame. Quotes Number 6: I will not make any deals with you. I've resigned. I will not be pushed, filed, stamped, indexed, briefed, debriefed or numbered. My life is my own. Crazy credits Patrick McGoohan does not receive on-screen acting credit on the final episode "Fall Out." His on-screen credit simply reads "Prisoner." Alternate versions An alternative version of "Chimes of Big Ben", the second episode to be broadcast, is available on video. Besides different closing credits, the opening credit sequence features different music as well. In addition, several scenes that were never aired appear in this version, including one that indicates No. 6 has already located the Village, not only rendering the rest of the episode moot, but also much of the series! Connections Edited into Derrick contre Superman (1992) User reviews129 Review Top review The coolest show of 2004 Who would think that the coolest show of 2004 would have been the rebroadcast of this 1960's British classic? When I lived in the U.K. I heard about this show a lot, and when I went to Wales was told about the town where it was filmed, but I had no idea why people were so durned excited about it. It can be murky and deliberately obscure, but I'm not sure I've ever seen a show as creative and bizarre....and you have to love the fact that No. 6 always looks so dammed serious! Seriously, it's worth watching, if only to remember how important good writing and unique ideas used to be in television! helpful•49 12 darienwerfhorst Dec 3, 2004 FAQ2 What's written on the envelope Number Six slaps down on the desk?
