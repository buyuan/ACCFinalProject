Quotes [repeated line] Matt Berry: Whiskey! Connections Featured in WatchMojoUK: Top 10 UK Comedies You've Probably Never Heard Of (2018) User reviews14 Review Top review 10/10 Funniest show in ages Snuff Box is an unconventional sketch show from Matt Berry and Rich Fulcher. Aka Dixon Bainbridge and Bob Fossil from The Mighty Boosh. And not forgetting Berry as Dr Sanchez, in the superb Garth Marenghi's Darkplace. The show is set in a Gentlemen's Club for Hangmen and features hanging, time travel, a variety of sports, fighting, shouting, rude words, pleasure, singing, dancing, intrigue and whisky. Snuff Box won't appeal to everyone's tastes, but if it were ever repeated, I would encourage you to take a look and see what you think. It provides a refreshing change from the awful but ever popular reality TV and the depressing soap operas. The music is done by Berry and my favourites must be The Empty Room (a homage to the Old Grey Whistle Test) and The Diary song set in the Gentlemen's Club. All I can say is anyone who has an out of the ordinary sense of humour, needs to watch Snuff Box. helpful•24 6 john-f-foster Feb 18, 2007 Details Edit Release date February 27, 2006 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Official site BBC (United Kingdom) Language English Also known as Табакерка Filming locations Debenham House, Addison Road, Holland Park, London, England, UK Production company Channel X See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 30 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 1.33 : 1 1.78 : 1 Related news Newswire: Aubrey Plaza to star in new film from director of The Greasy Strangler Feb 9avclub.com BBC reveals first Screenplay Award winners Jun 27ScreenDaily Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Spanish language plot outline for Snuff Box (2006)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
