Next door to Bernard's shop is the Nifty Gifty gift shop run by Fran, probably Bernard's only friend in the world. When Bernard's accountant goes on the run Bernard employs stress victim, Manny to help in his shop. This leads to a series of surreal adventures around the shop. —PH Moo bookshopbookaccountanttwo word titlealliterative title16 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genre Comedy Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Bernard is inspired by a real bookshop owner in Dublin, who Dylan Moran described as "He looks like he's swallowed a cup of sour milk and peed himself at the same time. He has this green bilious expression, years of displeasure have shaped his face." Goofs Fran says she needs to get her contact lenses when she's not wearing glasses. She then reads the Builder's Notice. Quotes Bernard: [selling a book] Enjoy. It's dreadful, but it's quite short. Connections Featured in Comedy Connections: Father Ted (2004) User reviews92 Review Top review Black Books proves that the UK is still the best breeding ground for humoristic series I always have been a big fan of Fawlty Towers, Father Ted and Blackadder. So when I knew about this series, I just had to see it. Now that I have seen it, there is only one thing I can say about it: Black books is absolutely great and hilarious. It proves that the UK is still the best breeding ground for humoristic series. Bernard Black - an anti-social, boozing and smoking sarcastic pessimist - runs his own book store. He doesn't like people who buy books and hates his customers. He has one employee: Manny. Manny looks more like a bum, never stands up for himself when he is the target of Bernard's sarcasm and is always full of stress. Next door to Bernard's shop is the Nifty Gifty gift shop run by Fran, probably the only friend Bernard has. The humor is perhaps not to everybody's taste. I guess not everybody will understand and appreciate the sarcasm and surrealism in this series, but I loved it. I would give this series a 10/10 if we could vote on it. helpful•94 10 philip_vanderveken Nov 11, 2004 Details Edit Release date September 29, 2000 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Official site Channel 4 (United Kingdom) Language English Also known as Книгарня Блека Filming locations Leigh Street, Bloomsbury, London, England, UK Production company Assembly Film and Television See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 25 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 1.78 : 1 Related news Dylan Moran: ‘I’ve offended people, I regret it and I’ll probably do it again’ May 6The Guardian - TV News Tamsin Greig: 'Romeo and Juliet speaks to our polarisation today' Apr 4The Guardian - TV News Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Spanish language plot outline for Black Books (2000)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
