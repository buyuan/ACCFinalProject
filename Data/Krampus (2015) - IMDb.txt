Meanwhile, this lack of festive spirit unleashes the wrath of Krampus: a demonic force of ancient evil intent on punishing non-believers. All hell breaks loose as beloved holiday icons take on a monstrous life of their own, laying siege to the fractured family's home and forcing them to fight for one another if they hope to survive. christmasfolklorechristmas horrorkrampusdemon246 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines You don't want to be on his list. Genres Comedy Drama Fantasy Horror Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for sequences of horror violence/terror, language and some drug material Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The film was originally to release on November 25 but was pushed back to December 4 to coincide with the Krampusnacht, a traditional Austrian festival held on December 5 that celebrates the Krampus coming to punish naughty children. Goofs After Max talks with his dad after dinner, he is shown reading his letter to Santa. The close up shows he is reading the front page, but when the camera angle changes to over his shoulder he is reading the other side. The angle switches back and he is again reading from the front page. Quotes Howard: We should have gone to stay with my brother! Linda: Your brother lives in a barn! Howard: Jesus was born in a barn! Crazy credits The closing credits feature a Christmas song, "Carol of the Bells", which is twisted to mention the Krampus and warn of his coming. Alternate versions (The Naughty Cut) Recently released by Scream Factory on 4K Ultra HD, this alternate version restores key dialogue and scenes that had to be trimmed from the original theatrical release to appease the MPAA.

Greetings from Lithuania. "Krampus" (2015) is sometimes kinda pretty creepy, sometimes a little scary, sometimes a little funny movie that eventually gets boring by trying to be different and by doing that, it quickly becomes very average. It is not a bad movie by any means, but it's just so ... average. There is nothing in it that you would like to return for a second viewing and nothing that you would be glued to your screen during first viewing. Overall, "Krampus" tries to be scary and kinda original Cristmas movie, and sometimes it succeeds, but mostly it doesn't by the end i didn't care what will happen to one or another two dimensional character. It is not a bad movie, but it's a quickly forgettable one. helpful•33 28 851222 Apr 10, 2016 FAQ1 What is with Krampus' face?
