After accosting an audience member, Jackie is sentenced to community service where he meets Harmony Schiltz (Leslie Mann). —Peter-Patrick76 (peter-patrick@mail.com) stand up comedylesbian daughterhas beencontempt of courtwedding reception460 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines nobody's a bargain Genres Comedy Drama Romance Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for crude sexual references and language throughout Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Robert De Niro was trained by comedian Jessica Kirson, and adopted one of her signature "moves": talking to herself sotto voce while turned away from the audience. He didn't take the move quite as far, preferring to cover his face with his hand while turning slightly to one side. Kirson appears in the film longer than any other stand-up comic, but she is not shown using this technique. Goofs Cloris Leachman's character is named "Conner" in the film but spelled "Connor" in the end credits. Quotes Harmony Schiltz: My dad used to love your TV show. We've watched every episode. Jackie Burke: Always nice to meet a fan. Harmony Schiltz: Yeah. Well, we just had the one TV.

This was funny, and it had heart. What's the matta wit you? I am puzzled by all the negative reviews. Yes, it's not The King of Comedy, or Goodfellas. But this movie was funny. De Niro's character Jackie was a 3-dimensional and human portrayal, and doesn't deserve to be dismissed as "another De Niro phoning it in" performance. The scenes where he performs stand-up comedy were genuinely funny. The relationship he has with his brother (Danny DeVito) were warm and convincing. It may not be a timeless masterpiece, but if you're at the Red Box or looking for your next movie night rental from the couch it is worth seeing. For what it's worth, I think Dirty Grandpa was raunchy and hilarious, and Grudge Match was also funny and had heart - with touching performances by both De Niro and Stallone. helpful•67 24 johnnybiscotti Apr 26, 2017 Details Edit Release date February 3, 2017 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Комик Filming locations Da Mikele Illagio, Queens, New York City, New York, USA Production companies Cinelou Films Linson Entertainment Anvil Films See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $15,000,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $1,659,002 Opening weekend US & Canada $10,723 Dec 11, 2016 Gross worldwide $1,659,002 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 2 hours Color Color Aspect ratio 2.39 : 1 Related news Hulu New Releases: November 2021 Nov 1Den of Geek Guadalajara Wraps Triumphant Return to In-Person Format with Animated Award Ceremony Oct 10Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was The Comedian (2016) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
