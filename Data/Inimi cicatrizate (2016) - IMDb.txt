It centers on Emanuel, a man in his early 20s, who spends his days at a sanatorium on the Black Sea coast, suffering from bone tuberculosis. Falling in love with another patient, he narrates his and his fellow patients' attempts to live life to the full as their bodies slowly wither but their minds refuse to give in. Blecher wrote the text, hailed as a masterpiece on publication in Romania in 1939, as autobiographical notes before he died, after 10 years of suffering, at the age of 29. —Variety male objectificationtwo word title1930syear 1937bare chested male26 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines A free adaptation of the literary works of M. Blecher Genres Biography Drama Certificate Not Rated Parents guide Add content advisory User reviews3 Review Top review 8/10 A wonderful picture Luminously photographed by Marius Panduru in the now unfashionable Academy ratio, Romanian director Radu Jude's superb new movie "Scarred Hearts" is based on the writings of Max Blecher and deals with the time he spent in a sanatorium on the Black Sea. The year is 1937 and Blecher's alter-ego is Emanuel, suffering from Pott's Disease, a form of TB. Though not an asylum, the hospital is something of a madhouse. Operations are performed with the minimum of anaesthetic, if any, and the doctors have no qualms in telling the largely manhandled patients exactly what's wrong with them and everything, including sex between the patients, seems to be permitted. Emanuel suffers more than most but bears it all stoically, even managing to fall in love with a former patient, and there is a good deal of humour in the film. Lucian Teodor Rus, making his screen debut, is excellent as Emanuel, even if he does spend most of the film on his back and Serban Pavlu is superb as his doctor. I'm sure for many people a two and a half hour film about illness might seem something of an endurance test but Jude makes even the grimmest passages seem somehow life-affirming. A wonderful picture. helpful•7 1 MOscarbradley Aug 2, 2017 Details Edit Release date November 18, 2016 (Romania) Countries of origin Romania Germany Belgium France Languages Romanian German Also known as Scarred Hearts Filming locations Black Sea, Romania Production companies HI Film Productions Komplizen Film Centrul National al Cinematografiei (CNC) See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross worldwide $13,847 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 2 hours 21 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 1.37 : 1 Related news Best Friend Forever boards sales on Radu Jude’s Berlinale Forum title ‘Uppercase Print’ (exclusive) Jan 21ScreenDaily New to Streaming: ‘Bad Times at the El Royale,’ ‘Mid90s,’ ‘The Turin Horse,’ and More Dec 21The Film Stage Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Inimi cicatrizate (2016) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
