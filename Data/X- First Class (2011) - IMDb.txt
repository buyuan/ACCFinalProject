Before they were archenemies, they were closest of friends, working together, with other Mutants (some familiar, some new), to stop the greatest threat the world has ever known. In the process, a rift between them opened, which began the eternal war between Magneto's Brotherhood and Professor X's X-MEN. —Twentieth Century Fox professor charles xavier characterwolverine charactervigilantemagneto charactershapeshifter349 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Before he was Professor X, he was Charles. Before he was Magneto, he was Erik. Before they were enemies, they were allies. Genres Action Adventure Sci-Fi Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of action and violence, some sexual content including brief partial nudity and language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia To prepare for his role as Charles Xavier, James McAvoy shaved his head. He soon learned that the filmmakers wanted Xavier to have a full head of hair in the prequel. Throughout the first month of filming McAvoy had to wear hair extensions. He finally shaved his head for X-Men: Apocalypse (2016). Goofs (at around 59 mins) When Xavier and Erik were confronting Emma Frost in the Soviet Union, some might think that it would have been impossible for Erik to crack Emma's neck with the metal bed frame because diamond is one of the hardest substances known to man. Hardness does not prevent cracking. There are different types of material strengths. Diamond's hardness does not mean that it is invulnerable to all types of stress. Quotes Erik Lehnsherr: Excuse me, I'm Erik Lehnsherr. Professor Charles Xavier: Charles Xavier. Logan: Go fuck yourself. Crazy credits SPOILER: The X-Films' title sequences features a weapon used by the villain of each film, backed by the X-Men's Cerebro device. In this film the title appears on the side of the Nazi coin Shaw gives to young Erik Lensherr, which he later uses against Shaw. Also, as this is a prequel, Cerebro does not appear. Connections Edited into 5 Second Movies: X-Men: First Class (2011) Soundtracks Concentration Camp (from X-Men (2000)) Written by Michael Kamen Courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation User reviews811 Review Top review 9/10 Best Xmen film yet! Xmen: First Class is simply fantastic. Strong emotion and explosive action. The acting is top notch. Delivery from every actor is at it's best, more so from Mystique, Beast, Xavier and Magneto. The story is more character based than action, however the action sequences are still superb. Personally i'd have liked to of seen it being a 15 and have a more adult but it wasn't a big issue. Also some more background story from the bad super's would have been good but again this wasn't too much of an issue and would leave some nice room for upcoming xmen movies. I don't want to say too much but to break it down... Go see this film no matter what you are into. There is something for everyone. 9/10 easy helpful•178 98 jacobmounter Jun 1, 2011 FAQ14 Which characters were adapted from the X-Men comic books? What is "X: First Class" about?
