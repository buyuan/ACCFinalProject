On the morning of her 16th birthday, Enola Holmes (Millie Bobby Brown) wakes to find that her mother (Helena Bonham Carter) has disappeared, leaving behind an odd assortment of gifts but no apparent clue as to where she's gone or why. After a free-spirited childhood, Enola suddenly finds herself under the care of her brothers Sherlock (Henry Cavill) and Mycroft (Sam Claflin), both set on sending her away to a finishing school for "proper" young ladies. Refusing to follow their wishes, Enola escapes to search for her mother in London. But when her journey finds her entangled in a mystery surrounding a young runaway Lord (Louis Partridge), Enola becomes a super-sleuth in her own right, outwitting her famous brother as she unravels a conspiracy that threatens to set back the course of history. —Netflix runawaybreaking the fourth walldetectivetrainamateur detective42 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Mystery runs in the family Genres Action Adventure Crime Drama Mystery Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for some violence Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Twice, Enola offers laboring boys £5 for their clothing. £5 in 1880 would be the equivalent of approximately £350 (US$455) in 2020. However, the buying power would be much greater: a common laborer earned about 3s 9d (three shillings and 9 pence) per week, or £9.15s., per year. Thus, Enola has offered a half a year's salary to the laborers for their clothes. Goofs The young marquess cannot take his seat in the House of Lords until age 21. Quotes Sherlock Holmes: Sometimes you must dangle your feet in the water in order to attract the sharks. Crazy credits Despite being co-produced by Warner Brothers, there is no Warner Shield company logo in either the opening or closing credits. Only the Legendary logo in the opening film. Connections Featured in Sean Chandler Talks About: Enola Holmes Movie Review (2020) User reviews1.5K Review Top review 7/10 A cute little movie I must have watched a different movie then some of these viewers. This was better than a 1,2,point movie..It was a cute movie. Millie has become a really good actress. This was not a Sherlock Holmes movie..is was a movie of the fictional little sister of Holmes. I thought is was very well acted and I even loved how she would speak to the audience, that was a good touch....this was very much worth seeing. I enjoyed it. helpful•202 145 boggie4758 Sep 24, 2020 FAQ4 Where is the film being made? In England or the States? Where's the Warner Bros. shield logo? Why the producers does not put the Warner Bros. shield logo in the opening or closing credits?
