(Season 1) Genres Action Adventure Drama Sci-Fi Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The Starfleet vessels seen in the first season, including the Discovery, the Shenzou and the redesigned Enterprise, were all designed by production artist John Eaves. Eaves work with Star Trek spans three decades. Probably his most notable contribution was the design of the Enterprise-E for Star Trek: First Contact (1996). Goofs With Michael being the adoptive sister of Spock, the series has many flashbacks to their childhood and upbringing on Vulcan. Spock's Vulcan half-brother, Sybok, does not appear nor is mention during these scenes. In Star Trek V: The Final Frontier (1989), Spock says that he and Sybok grew up together. However, since it's never stated when Sybok joined Sarek's home - only that he did so following his mother's death - or when he was exiled from the family, it's not impossible Sybok moved in after Burnham, and left before she graduated (the two extremes of the flashbacks). Also, since Sybok was never mentioned before Star Trek V, it seems reasonable the family never spoke of him again after his estrangement. Alternate versions The serif-font legends and subtitles in the "broadcast" episodes are absent from the DVD versions, where they are replaced with the standard DVD subtitles. Connections Featured in MsMojo: Top 10 Female Lead TV Shows You Should Be Watching in 2017 (2017) User reviews3.7K Review Top review 3/10 Soap opera in space This is not Star Trek, it's an insult to Gene Roddenberry's vision. Star Trek is about learning life lessons through logical, scientific approach bereft of emotion. Each episode should be self-contained and explore subtitle aspects of interactions between members of the entire main crew. Discovery has been about one character, who cries her way through ridiculous plot holes of an unending soap opera-like storyline, and unrealistic character development. Shameful they call this Star Trek. So disappointed. helpful•68 17 dlemur Jan 14, 2021 FAQ4 Why do the Klingons in this series look completely different to how they look in all of the previous Star Trek shows and films? Do I need to have seen any previous Star Trek TV series and movies in order to be able to understand and follow this show? When is this series situated?
