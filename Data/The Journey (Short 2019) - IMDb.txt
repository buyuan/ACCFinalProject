In Hollywood's opinion, City of Istanbul is the mystic ancient&modern place that for the chases of the special agents. Istanbul is not this city. It has more realistic big and short stories. Technically, the film is very good but it's not Istanbul. It's Hollywood's Istanbul. helpful•1 6 hmmtu Feb 7, 2019 Details Edit Release date February 3, 2019 (United States) Country of origin United Kingdom Official site Istanbul as told by Ridley Scott Languages English Turkish Filming locations Istanbul, Turkey Production company RSA Films See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 6 minutes Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
