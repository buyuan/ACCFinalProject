Both are single and became pregnant by accident. Janis, middle-aged, doesn't regret it and she is exultant. The other, Ana, an adolescent, is scared, repentant and traumatized. Janis tries to encourage her while they move like sleepwalkers along the hospital corridors. The few words they exchange in these hours will create a very close link between the two, which by chance develops and complicates, and changes their lives in a decisive way. —Sony Pictures female leadfashion photographermotherhooddna testpostnatal depression11 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines New York Film Festival 59 Closing Night Selection Genre Drama Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for some sexuality Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia The director had first discussed the project all the way back in 2011, describing it as "the Don Quixote of motherhood".

Seamlessly connecting the past with the present ... and handling a melodramatic plot without any melodrama. Also a masterful performance from his muse - Penelope Cruz. helpful•12 3 rakeshroy31 Oct 9, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 8, 2021 (Spain) Countries of origin Spain France Language Spanish Also known as Parallel Mothers Filming locations Madrid, Spain Production companies El Deseo Pathé Radio Televisión Española (RTVE) See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross worldwide $4,835,807 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 2 hours Color Color Sound mix SDDS Dolby Digital DTS Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Jane Campion Will Never Direct a Superhero Movie: ‘I Hate Them’ (Exclusive) Nov 17Variety Film + TV ‘Parallel Mothers’ Star Penélope Cruz on Collaborating With Pedro Almodóvar: ‘He Cannot Lie to Me, and I’m the Same Way With Him’ Nov 17Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Madres paralelas (2021) officially released in Canada in French?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
