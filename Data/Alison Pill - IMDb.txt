Personal Quote: When I meet people I'm not usually freaked out. I guess the first big name I worked with was Sissy Spacek and that was really interesting just because she's so incredible and I learned so much from just watching her. But she's also so unassuming that I loved working with her. It wasn't like working with a star, it was Sissy. Not a big deal. Trivia: Was engaged to actor Jay Baruchel from December 2010 until March 2013.
