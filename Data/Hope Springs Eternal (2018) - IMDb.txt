Soundtracks Up At Night Written and performed by Cimorelli User reviews14 Review Top review 8/10 High School is Hard Hope has accepted that her cancer is terminal, and enjoys special attention from the most popular girls in high school because of her diagnosis. And her teachers excuse her from tests and assignments. When Hope's mother wants to intervene in her school life, the guidance counselor explains to Hope's mother that high school is hard for everyone, not just Hope. When her cancer goes into remission and she is no longer considered terminal, Hope is uncertain how her friends and teachers will react and hides the truth. She faces her fears and learns that some things are more important than being popular. This movie has some funny moments and some serious and touching moments with her friend Sarah, who also has cancer. All in all, a good movie that you'll want to see again. helpful•5 6 nrehrig Aug 12, 2018 Details Edit Release date August 10, 2018 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Official Facebook Page Language English Filming locations Chicago, Illinois, USA Production company Gylden Entertainment See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $750,000 (estimated) See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 18 minutes Color Color Related news Netflix Is Losing A Lot Of Great Movies In November Oct 21We Got This Covered ‘The Shawshank Redemption’ at 25: Hope Springs Eternal in One of the Greatest Movies of All Time Sep 23Slash Film Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Hope Springs Eternal (2018) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
