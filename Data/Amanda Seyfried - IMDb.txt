Personal Quote: Am I confident about my looks? No. Not even a little bit. But this is the way I look, and I'm stuck with it. I work out hard, but I'm never going to be confident about getting into a bikini. Some days, I look at myself and think, "Ugh, I can't go anywhere," and other days I feel, "Yeah, I look okay." I just put on a pretty dress and a ton of make-up and get on with it. See more » Trivia: Her role in the drama film Nine Lives (2005) was written specifically for her.
