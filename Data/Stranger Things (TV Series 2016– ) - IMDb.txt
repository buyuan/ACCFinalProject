Dark government agencies and seemingly malevolent supernatural forces converge on the town, while a few of the locals begin to understand that there's more going on than meets the eye. —Charles J. government conspiracy1980sfriendshippropagandamonster121 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines The world is turning upside down. (Season 1) Genres Drama Fantasy Horror Mystery Sci-Fi Thriller Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The set for Starcourt Mall in season 3 is a real derelict mall on the outskirts of Atlanta called Gwinnett Place Mall. It was originally built in 1984, but has been largely abandoned since late 2018. The production team on Stranger Things built 40 storefronts with full interiors to create the authentic looking 80s mall. Goofs During a number of episodes, people are seen 'interrupting' someone talking on a two way radio or CB - that is, one person is talking/transmitting, and another person transmits to interrupt them, and then the other person hears this interruption and stops transmitting. This was done a few times on the kid's CB radios, and on the radios used by the police. Those radios - the CB and the police radios of the era from the show - don't work like that. If you are transmitting, and someone else transmits, you will not hear them. Quotes Eleven: Friends don't lie. Crazy credits The Stranger Things opening titles and fonts mimic the film grain and look of 1980's television series opening credits.

Season 1 starts of the show at a 10/10 absolutely perfect with great characters hooking me and many others from the start. Season 2 is almost as good at a 8/10 but this season has the worst episode in the show, it is just painful. Season 3 again is great at a 9/10 I think I enjoy it a bit more than most people, but this season is the most "This show is in the 80s" thing about the show but still great. helpful•9 0 joostejameshelm Aug 26, 2021 FAQ13 What timeline does this show take place? Does each Season 'resolve' at the end? Or is there a cliff-hanger such that you have to progress to the next season, presenting more of one continuous story? Why Dustin got new teeth at season 2 but he doesn't at season 3?
