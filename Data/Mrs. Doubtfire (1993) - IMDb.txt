But after a disastrous birthday party for his son, Chris, his wife, Miranda, draws the line and files a divorce. He can see their three children only once a week which doesn't sit well with him. He also holds a job at a TV studio as a shipping clerk under the recommendation of his liason. But when Miranda puts out an ad for a nanny, he takes it upon himself to make a disguise as a British lady named Mrs. Doubtfire. And he must also deal with Miranda's new boyfriend, Stu Dunemyer. —Blazer346 transvestismcrossdressingcross dressingdivorceimpersonator151 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines She will rock your world. Genres Comedy Drama Family Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for some sexual references Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia According to one biography, Robin Williams decided to test out the believability of his Mrs. Doubtfire character during filming by going, as Mrs. Doubtfire, into an adult bookstore and making a purchase. He was able to do so without being recognized. Goofs Stu's Stunt double can be seen when he jumps off the diving board at the pool area. Quotes Miranda: What happened? Mrs. Doubtfire: He was quite fond of the drink. It was the drink that killed him. Miranda: How awful. He was an alcoholic? Mrs. Doubtfire: No, he was hit by a Guinness truck. So it was quite literally the drink that killed him. Alternate versions The Australian DVD was made using the cut UK version, meaning it has 13 seconds of dialogue cut despite no previous censorship problems. VHS, theatrical and television versions are all intact. Connections Edited into The Green Fog (2017) Soundtracks Babalu Written by Margarita Lecuona User reviews318 Review Top review funny and wonderful movie! Many people say that "Mrs.Doubtfire" is one of the funniest movies ever made in the U.S. I agree with the above idea for the following two reasons. First,performance of the voice of Robin Williams is very wonderful.For example, he uses a lot of funny ad lib in the stand-in of animation in the first scene. Second, Robin Williams and Sally Field as well as the three children act very delightfully though the movie deals with a rather serious theme---warmth and importance of family. Some people say Sally Field doesn't act well in this movie. But, I think that she acts a role of a wife whom is worried about her husband excelentlly. We feel big love of both father and mother toward children. It is not only a real funny comedy but also a real wonderful family movie. helpful•80 18 yumincoromochi Nov 30, 2004 FAQ4 Who is Daniel Hillard?
