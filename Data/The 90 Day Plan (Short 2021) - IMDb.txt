Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Short Comedy Parents guide Add content advisory User reviews3 Review Top review 10/10 What diversity looks and feels like. I love Gabriela Garcia Medina's aesthetic and perspective as a director. The images and characters in 90 day plan are so enticing! You want to follow them home and keep experiencing their choices!! I love the way these young girls are portrayed. The quirks, needs and wants of all our little 15 yr old cousins but the huge appetite for something bigger and better and the raw guts to try and get it! helpful•0 0 chikalabamba Nov 15, 2021 Details Edit Release date November 1, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Production company Mira Mira Pictures See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $5,500 (estimated) See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Color Color Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was The 90 Day Plan (2021) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
