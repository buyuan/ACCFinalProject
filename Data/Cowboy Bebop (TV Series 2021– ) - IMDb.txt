Anime creator Shinichiro Watanabe claimed to be on board with the idea, and was appointed as the executive producer, along with some of the original anime's writers. Although they still didn't have a director on their team, they were enthusiastic about the concept and planned to release the movie in 2011, with Keanu Reeves cast as Spike. Unfortunately, the movie missed its 2011 release date, and in 2013, Reeves commented on Reddit saying,"Cowboy Bebop does not look like it's going to happen with me in it. ...It would cost, like, half a billion dollars to make it...". Crazy credits The opening credits are a live-action version of the Kaubôi bibappu (1998) title sequence (with a few scenes removed/added).
