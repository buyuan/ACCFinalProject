This spice "MELANGE" is said to only be produced in the desert planet of Arrakis, where the FREMEN people have the prophecy of a man who will lead them to true freedom. This "desert planet"of Arrakis is also known as DUNE. A secret report of the space "GUILD" talks about some circumstances and plans that could jeopardize the production of "SPICE" with four planets involved: ARRAKIS, CALADAN, GIEDI PRIME and KAITAIN, a world at least visually very alike to Earth and house of the Emperor of the known Universe. The "GUILD" sends a third stage navigator to KAITAIN to ask details from the Emperor and to demand him the killing of young Paul Atreides, son of the Duke Leto Atreides of CALADAN. —David del Real ---@DavidRealActor---- space traveldesert planetwaterdunegiant worm245 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines It is a world where sandworms 1,000 feet long guard creation's greatest treasure - the spice that prolongs life.

And a young leader with incredible powers will emerge to command an army of five million warriors in the final battle for control of a universe and its source of ultimate power. The planet called Dune. Genres Action Adventure Sci-Fi Certificate PG-13 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Writer and director David Lynch has said he considers this movie the only real failure of his career. To this day, he refuses to talk about the production in great detail, and has refused numerous offers to work on a Special Edition DVD. Lynch claims revisiting the movie would be too painful an experience to endure. Many fans hope that he will eventually come around. Goofs When the Guild navigator visits the Emperor in the beginning, as the black container enters through the two gold doors, an assistant to the navigator trips and falls on the left side of the container. Quotes Paul: I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will let it pass over me and through me. And when it has passed I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where it has gone, there will be nothing. Only I will remain. Crazy credits Gurney's Baliset is Based on "The Stick" Created by Emmett Chapman Alternate versions As of 2006, the Alan Smithee version had been released in a two disk set containing both the Lynch version and the extended version. However, many scenes were edited out once again: The heart plug scene when the baron is introduced is not in the extended version anymore (it is still in the original). The scene where Thufir discovers the burning wierding modules is also missing, as well as Thufir's death scene. (Thufir's death scene is included as a deleted scene in the special features) Connections Edited into Destination Dune (1984) User reviews831 Review Top review 8/10 A very good effort. Every time I see this film I like it more, yet can see why people would dislike this movie, and I can sum up it's shortcoming this way: Not close enough to the book to humour the people who have read the book, to confusing for people who have not. Thus Lynch managed to get a lot of bad press about this near masterpiece. It is very difficult to fit the plot of Herbert's masterpiece into 130 minutes, but I think Lynch did a good job, sadly he added som stuff that was not in the book. Where Lynch does excel is in setting the mood. To help him he had probably the best possible cast for such a movie and the best musical score ever. The acting overall is excellent (except possibly Maclachlan and Jones) and for me who read the book before seeing the film, it is hard not to see Stewart as Halleck. The timing of the acting and events is almost perfect. If Lynch had had help by a better scriptwriter to curb some of his wilder additions and flesh out the plot a bit and this could have been one of the best sci-fi movies ever. As is, it is very good, but somewhat flawed. helpful•175 66 Chris-742 Apr 12, 2004 FAQ7 What is Dune about? What are Weirding Modules? Why did Shaddam IV want to destroy House Atriedes?
