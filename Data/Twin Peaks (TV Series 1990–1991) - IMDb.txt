FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper is called in to investigate her strange demise only to uncover a web of mystery that ultimately leads him deep into the heart of the surrounding woodland and his very own soul. —Douglas Baptie mysterious deathmurdercult tvsmall town sheriffsmall town138 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines A town where everyone knows everyone and nothing is what it seems. Genres Crime Drama Mystery Thriller Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia In the 2014 book Reflections: An Oral History of Twin Peaks by Brad Dukes, Jules Haimovitz (who was the president and COO of Spelling Entertainment while Twin Peaks was on) says that during the show's run, he got a call from the financier Carl Lindler demanding to know who killed Laura Palmer. Lindler told Haimovitz that he was asking not for himself but for then-president of the United States George Bush, who was in turn asking for Mikhail Gorbachev, then the leader of the U.S.S.R. Quotes Dale Cooper: Harry, I'm going to let you in on a little secret. Every day, once a day, give yourself a present. Don't plan it. Don't wait for it. Just let it happen. It could be a new shirt at the men's store, a catnap in your office chair, or two cups of good, hot black coffee. Crazy credits There are some episodes that don't end with the usual Homecoming Queen photo of Laura Palmer and "Laura Palmer's Theme" in the credits: Episode 2 credits feature the Little Man from Another Place seen from above and dancing. Episode 8 features Gersten Hayward (Alicia Witt) playing the piano. Episode 14 shows Agent Cooper, the red curtains and the song "The World Spins" by Julee Cruise. Episode 18 features Ben Horne's old home movies seen in this same episode. Episode 29 features the coffee cup given to Cooper in the Red Room and Laura's face on it. Alternate versions Recent home media releases have removed the SPELLING logo from in-between the end credits and the Lynch/Frost Productions logo. This has caused the distinctive fall into the low-motif portion of the end credit theme ('Laura Palmer's Theme') during Season 1 to be lost, albeit it is partly retained in Season 2 due to the end credits being slightly extended and the low-motif portion beginning just as the credits section ends, rather than after. Connections Edited into Hollywood Burn (2006) Soundtracks Twin Peaks Theme Written by Angelo Badalamenti User reviews305 Review Top review David Lynch's masterpiece I have to admit when I first watched the pilot episode of Twin Peaks a couple of years ago, I wasn't sure what to think. I knew about David Lynch, having recently seen Blue Velvet, and I knew he was a director that was on the outlandish side. I borrowed the rest of the series from a friend, and after I watched the first 3 or 4 episodes, I was still scratching my head. I thought the murder premise was well done but I kept asking myself "why are these characters so strange?" However, as I got more into the series, I found myself obsessively hooked. The series, in it's own ominous way, was extremely funny and there were so many great one liners ("that's a damn good cup of coffee") and the characters kept you second guessing. Though some characters were obviously villains, others had intentions that were often indistinguishable. As I relentlessly watched the show over a three week period, I found myself laughing out loud and being disturbed at the same time. Ben Horne's meltdown is one of the funniest things I have ever seen in any TV series, I chuckle just thinking about it. Only David Lynch could think of something that was so eccentric and funny at the same time. So in the end, I must say I found this show endlessly amusing. Almost every person on the show has their own idiosyncrasy, appearances by future stars like Heather Graham and David Duchovny injected humor and depth into the show, and heck, there was a sheriff named Harry S Truman, what else do you need? I am glad to see the first season is on DVD, I can't wait until the rest is released. I wish this show had been on much longer but it is such a bizarre show that I can understand why mainstream America did not understand it. I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone that likes TV shows which are light-hearted or straightforward. Be warned, the final episode is completely bizarre, and not necessarily funny. As a whole, the show has a very alien feel to it and may chase many people away, but if you understand David Lynch's warped sense of humor and can see the sheer lunacy of the show, you will find it endlessly entertaining. helpful•102 33 mullermike Feb 9, 2003 FAQ17 A NOTE REGARDING SPOILERS A NOTE REGARDING THE FILM "Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me."
