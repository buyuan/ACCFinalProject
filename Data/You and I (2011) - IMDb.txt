User reviews9 Review Top review 7/10 Breakaway Film Review Been waiting for this movie for a while. Ever since I heard they were making a movie revolving around the popular Russian act T.A.T.U. I have always really enjoyed their music so I was stoked to see the movie. The movie was really good, I was really impressed by all the actual Russian dialogue and the actors (especially Misha Barton) did amazing at speaking the language and speaking with an accent. For the T.A.T.U fans, it is great that the girls actually appear in the film, too bad it wasn't longer. The plot was different too. It is not just a "lesbian" film, which was what I was expecting but a story of overcoming the tough road you have been dealt and making your way in the world. Both girls were living a difficult life. One rich but addicted to drugs, the other, poor with no future. Through music and finding each other they eventually ended up living a dream.
