Connections Edited into Earth (2007) User reviews100 Review Top review 10/10 The most amazing achievement in natural history TV has ever given The subtitle of the series is not an exaggeration; it has a literal meaning: This is indeed our planet as "never seen before". Right from the outset you are witnessing the most amazing pictures modern technology has ever produced: Views from space, but close enough so we may see the glorious beauty of specific regions of our home planet. Birds of paradise of such beauty that can convince you this is the real paradise and you need not ask for anything more; All the creatures are filmed in unique settings and situations (a polar bear with two cubs emerging from their den as spring comes and gliding down a snow covered slope, the strategic genius of wild dogs encircling a herd of impalas, rare views of a snow leopard and her cub, a white shark in chase of a seal bursting completely out of the sea and hanging in the air for a second and hundreds of other breath-taking shots. Feeling happy for the gift you are given and the next moment plunged in bitter thoughts about how unbelievably brutally has mankind treated it. My rating: Definitely 10/10. helpful•154 23 cmcoveos Dec 16, 2006 Details Edit Release date February 27, 2006 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Official sites BBC (United Kingdom) Official site Language English Also known as Planet Earth Extremes Production company British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 8 hours 58 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 1.78 : 1 Related news UK Government Lining Up Requirement For Public Service Broadcasters To Produce “Distinctively British” Content — Rts Convention Sep 15Deadline Film + TV ‘Planet Earth’ Producer Jonny Keeling to Head BBC Natural History Unit (Exclusive) Sep 6Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Spanish language plot outline for Planet Earth (2006)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
