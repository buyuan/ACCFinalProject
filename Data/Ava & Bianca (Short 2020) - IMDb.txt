The film explores who they are beyond their trans identity, what it means to be a female cinematographer and last but certainly not least, what it means to be a woman in this moment in time. Our film is about the complex dimensionless of identity, the magic that unfolds when two people can find deep identification with one another, the experience of feeling seen and understood and the power of two women forging ahead in a very difficult landscape, as women, as trans people and as cinematographers.
