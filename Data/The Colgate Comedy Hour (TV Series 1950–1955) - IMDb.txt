Connections Featured in Avalon (1990) User reviews9 Review Top review First Color Show? Recently, Gloria O'Connor (Donald's widow) told me that she thought the Nov. 22, 1953 Colgate Comedy Hour was the first color telecast of the newly-approved color system. Evidently it was part of a test. Many old-timers have insisted that the Jan 1 Rose Bowl Parade was the first color telecast. Can anyone shed some light on the Colgate Comedy Hour? I met Joyce Smith, one of the original dancers, at an NBC Reunion and she also believed that the show was telecast in color. It would be a good thing to straighten this out for the history books. In addition, Joyce said the Comedy hour originated at the original 'El Capitan' theater on Vine Street. helpful•2 0 jpd1-1 Oct 9, 2005 Details Edit Release date September 10, 1950 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Michael Todd Revue Filming locations Los Angeles, California, USA Production companies Colgate-Palmolive-Peet National Broadcasting Company (NBC) See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour Color Black and White Color Sound mix Mono Aspect ratio 1.33 : 1 Related news Irma Kalish, Prolific and Pioneering TV Comedy Writer, Dies at 96 Sep 6Variety Film + TV Norman Lear To Receive Golden Globes’ 2021 Carol Burnett Award For TV Contributions Jan 28Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was The Colgate Comedy Hour (1950) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
