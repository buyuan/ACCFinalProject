As with every show, there were a few episodes that were dry but overall it was really good and I couldn't resist binge watching episodes! The shows final finale was by far one of the best I've ever seen, couldn't help but shed some tears. They tie everything together perfectly, I would deff rewatch this series helpful•18 1 bbgrl93 Oct 17, 2018 FAQ5 What is the song playing in the final scene?
