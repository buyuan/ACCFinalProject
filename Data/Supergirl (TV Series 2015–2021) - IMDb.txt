However, his older cousin, Kara, was also intended to accompany the infant as his protector. Unfortunately, Kara was accidentally diverted into the timeless Phantom Zone for years before finally arriving on Earth decades later and found by her cousin who had grown into Superman. Years later, Kara Danvers is a young professional adrift in a thankless job until a fateful crisis ignites a sense of purpose using Kryptonian powers she had long hidden. Inspired, Kara decides to emulate her cousin's superheroic ways, only to find her foster sister introducing her to the secret Department of Extra-Normal Operations, dedicated to fighting alien menaces including those Kara inadvertently led to Earth. Now with such help, the Maid of Might takes her place as Earth's newest champion with new friends and enemies challenging her world. —Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) superherofemale herobased on comic bookdc comicsfemale superhero60 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines It's not a bird. It's not a plane. It's not a man. It's Supergirl. (season 1) Genres Action Adventure Drama Sci-Fi Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Just as Stephen Amell (for the title role of Arrow (2012)) and Grant Gustin (for The Flash (2014)), Melissa Benoist was the very first of a thousand actors to audition for the role of Supergirl. Goofs Sometimes a green light can be seen in the reflection of Kara's glasses. This is due to the anti-reflective coating on the glasses and it's not a reflection of a green screen. Quotes [once The Flash is revealed to be in National City] Cat Grant: There's a new superhero in National City. This is huge; direct competition for Supergirl. Kara Danvers: He doesn't have to be... competition. Cat Grant: Would you prefer... a sidekick? Barry Allen: No, not a sidekick. More like an equal, or an ally... [Winn pats Barry's shoulder] Barry Allen: ... a new partner, maybe? [Cat stares stoically; Barry nods] Barry Allen: Speaking was the wrong choice. I see that now. Crazy credits The Warner Bros and DC Comics logos (2016-2021) are colored red and blue; they are also set against the sky and are brushed by a red cape. Connections Featured in Conan: David Spade/Jenna Dewan-Tatum/Dan Cummins (2015) User reviews935 Review Top review 7/10 Yet again supergirl gets shafted I really loved this show and hoped it would keep going and granted the last season or two has been lack luster and yes there are parts of this show that could have been done better.... But I'm more mad than upset because it seems supergirl always takes a backseat to Superman she's had like one movie for his how many and the same for series as well she's has had one series for the multiple series Superman has ...just like batgirl with batman...I mean look how long it took for wonder woman to get an update ..... I mean heaven forbid a kick ass chick get the spotlight and decent writing ... it's like oh well we tried let's wait another 30 years to try again. helpful•8 0 mmccaskill-678-138101 Nov 5, 2021 FAQ5 Why does Kara wear glasses when she's with people who know she's Supergirl? If Kara was older than Clark on Krypton, how come she's younger than him on Earth? Is this part of the same universe as Flash and Arrow?
