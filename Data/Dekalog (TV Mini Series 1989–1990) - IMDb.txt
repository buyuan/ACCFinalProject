Two of these, Dekalog 5 and 6, are shorter cuts from the feature-length films--Krotki film o zabijaniu (A Short Film About Killing) and Krotki film o milosci (A Short Film About Love), respectively. They deal with the emotional turmoil suffered by humanity, when instinctual acts and societal morality conflict. —Tad Dibbern <DIBBERN_D@a1.mscf.upenn.edu> ten commandmentsmoralitypolandtv mini seriesauteur tv17 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genre Drama Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Stanley Kubrick has said writers Krzysztof Kieslowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz "have the very rare ability to dramatize their ideas rather than just talking about them". Connections Featured in Zomergasten: Episode #13.2 (2000) User reviews48 Review Top review 10 stories you'll want to talk about long after you've watched them `Dekalog' **** There are some `movies' that are hard to describe. `Dekalog' is one. It's not really a movie. It is a ten part made-for-TV mini series. Don't remember seeing `Dekalog' when it was first shown on TV? Neither do I. `Dekalog' was made for made for Polish TV in 1987 by Krzysztof Kieslowski (`Blue', `White', `Red' and `Double Life Veronique'). Each segment of `Dekalog' is about one hour and is thematically driven by one of the 10 Commandments. All the stories take place in the same high rise apartment in Warsaw. The characters in each of the stories don't necessarily overlap, yet we see some of the characters from one story walk through another. This lack of overlap is also true of the stories and the commandments. Even knowing which commandment was the basis for a story, I couldn't always see a direct correlation. It's as if Kieslowski and his co-writer Krzysztof Piesiewicz view the 10 Commandments as a ruler to measure one's actions, a curb to provide bounds for one's choices or maybe a mirror to reflect on one's life. This reflective view of the commandments comes through in each of the stories. In "I Am the Lord Our God" a young boy and his father rely on a computer to decide whether or not it's safe to go out on the ice. "Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery" is about a young boy who spies on and stalks the woman next door. Magda, his neighbor, is free and easy. And when she finds out about the young voyeur, she sets out prove there is no such things as love. Commandment by commandment Kieslowski provides us our own voyeuristic moment into the lives of the people in this one Warsaw apartment. This is truly a great movie. Buy a copy and watch the stories with another movie fan. Dekalog contains 10 stories that you'll want to talk about long after you've watched them. helpful•51 10 minnow-6 Jul 25, 2000 Details Edit Release date December 10, 1989 (Poland) Countries of origin Poland West Germany Language Polish Also known as 十诫 Filming locations Warsaw, Mazowieckie, Poland Production companies Sender Freies Berlin (SFB) Telewizja Polska (TVP) Zespol Filmowy "Tor" See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 9 hours 32 minutes Color Color Sound mix Mono Aspect ratio 1.33 : 1 Related news Steve McQueen: The Television Auteur Nov 8MUBI ‘Nine Perfect Strangers’: Nicole Kidman Calls Hulu Drama “Trippy” & Reveals She Stayed In Character For Five Months – TCA Aug 6Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Dekalog (1989) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
