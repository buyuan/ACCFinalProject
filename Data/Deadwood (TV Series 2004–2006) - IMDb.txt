Into this uncivilized outpost ride a disillusioned and bitter ex-lawman, Wild Bill Hickok, and Seth Bullock, a man hoping to find a new start for himself. Both men find themselves quickly on opposite sides of the legal and moral fence from Al Swearengen, saloon owner, hotel operator, and incipient boss of Deadwood. The lives of these three intertwine with many others, the high-minded and the low-lifes who populate Deadwood in 1876. —Jim Beaver <jumblejim@prodigy.net> saloonprofanityviolenceoutlawgreed29 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines No Law Can Make It Respectable Genres Crime Drama History Western Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Most of the characters (Seth Bullock, Al Swearengen, Sol Star, Reverend Smith, the Metz family, et cetera, in addition to the more famous Wild Bill Hickock, Calamity Jane, and Jack McCall), have real-life counterparts.

Connections Featured in Making 'Deadwood': The Show Behind the Show (2004) User reviews329 Review Top review 10/10 They finally got the western right! Don't get me wrong, there have been great westerns to come before Deadwood, but none of them really got it right. There is just a reality that some people aren't willing to deal that after 50 years of our history being whitewashed through film and TV, we're finally starting to see the truth. David Milch has done his research and discovered the wonderfully bizarre contradiction of languages used in the old west. Watching the cast of Deadwood converse with a combination of old world English laced with profanity straight from the gutter is incredible and feels right for the first time. Where do people think our language came from? People always want to think that they were the first to do something, when things like profanity, substance abuse and prostitution have been around since before man walked erect. Along with the incredible dialog and storytelling, David Milch has introduced possibly the greatest character to ever come to TV or film...Al Swearengen. Ian McShane plays Al with the same intense conviction and truth that the character himself lives by. In Al's world things are black and white and never apologizes for a second for living his life by a strict code of morals of his own making. I don't think we've ever seen a character go from crying after a mercy killing to watching a murder he orchestrated stone faced. This is indeed a special show that is continuing to pave the way for the facts of our history to finally be told with truth...Instead of the whitewashing we've seen our whole lives to make us feel better about ourselves. helpful•394 101 killgore86 Sep 23, 2004 FAQ5 Will there be a season 4? When are the Deadwood movies coming (are they coming at all)? How can two 2-Hour movies (totalling 4 hours) have more information than 6 hour long episodes?
