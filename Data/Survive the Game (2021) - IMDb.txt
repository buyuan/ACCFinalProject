It only got Bruce Willis for some reason, I can't believe he accepted a role in this movie. Do yourself a favor and avoid watching this movie at all cost (Even if it was for free). helpful•16 4 mohalhamouri Oct 10, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 8, 2021 (Poland) Country of origin United States Official site Official site Language English Also known as Выжить в игре Filming locations Puerto Rico Production companies BondIt Media Capital Buffalo 8 Productions Emmett/Furla/Oasis Films (EFO Films) See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 37 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 2.39:1 Related news Bruce Willis reunites with Chad Michael Murray and Jesse Metcalfe in trailer for Fortress Nov 12Flickeringmyth Movie Review – Survive the Game (2021) Oct 7Flickeringmyth Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Survive the Game (2021) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
