She wishes to become a fashion designer, having been gifted with talent, innovation, and ambition all in equal measures. But life seems intent on making sure her dreams never come true. Having wound up penniless and orphaned in London at 12, 10 years later Estella runs wild through the city streets with her best friends and partners-in-(petty)-crime, Horace and Jasper, two amateur thieves. When a chance encounter vaults Estella into the world of the young rich and famous, however, she begins to question the existence she's built for herself in London and wonders whether she might, indeed, be destined for more after all. —Katie female villaincruella de vil characterlive action adaptationmurderfashion328 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Hello cruel world. Genres Adventure Comedy Crime Drama Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for some violence and thematic elements Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The placement of the suit of armor in Hell Hall replicates that of the original One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961) animated film. Goofs Cruella crashes a car into an old-fashioned British red phone box, which buckles on impact. These phone boxes were made of cast iron which would, with sufficient force, break, not bend. Quotes Cruella de Vil: They say there are five stages of grief. Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Well I'd like to add one more... Cruella de Vil: Revenge. Crazy credits There is a scene in the closing credits: Anita and Roger receive a gift of two Dalmatians from Cruella. The dogs are named Pongo, and Perdita, the parent dogs from 101 Dalmatians. Roger starts to play the Cruella DeVil song from One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961).

To be really honest, I had very low positive thoughts about this movie. But, boy was I in for a surprise. Emma Stone is the show stealer. It's really a fun dark movie. Did expect this from Disney.
