Personal Quote: I've broken bones doing stunts, I've always been one to have a go. But after a while I realized that there are some things not worth doing. Stunt men pay a price, some of them can hardly walk when they're older. John Woo set me on fire twice for Hard Target (1993). It burnt my ears! But I would've done anything for John Woo.
