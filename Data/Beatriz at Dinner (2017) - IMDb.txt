A difference of thoughts and opinions causes her to be a thorn in the side of the hosts and their invited guests. car breakdownbillionairekilling an animalholistic health practitionerreal estate developer152 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines She was invited, but she's not welcome. Genres Comedy Drama Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for language and a scene of violence Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The movie features the song "Canción de las simples cosas", originally performed by the Argentinian musician César Isella, but performed by Salma Hayek for this film. Goofs Beatriz drives from Santa Monica south to Newport Beach, but we see her driving on the 101 Freeway in Agoura Hills, which is many miles northwest not only of Santa Monica but Los Angeles proper. Quotes Beatriz: All tears flow from the same source. Connections Featured in The Graham Norton Show: Salma Hayek/David Walliams/James Buckley/Ed Westwick/Liam Payne (2017) Soundtracks An Ending (Ascent) Written and Performed by Brian Eno User reviews161 Review Top review Nithing funny here but Selma Hayek is magnificent Found nothing funny at all in this movie. The rich white people are shallow and selfish and make their money by ruining the planet and the lives impacted by their so-called 'developments'. On the other hand, Beatriz is a highly relatable character bewildered by these people. helpful•7 4 d_r_card Jul 17, 2018 Details Edit Release date June 9, 2017 (United States) Country of origin United States Languages English Spanish Also known as Beatriz Akşam Yemeğinde Filming locations Villa Cascata - 27530 Calicut Rd, Malibu, California, USA Production companies BRON Studios Creative Wealth Media Finance Killer Films See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross US & Canada $7,115,854 Opening weekend US & Canada $141,959 Jun 11, 2017 Gross worldwide $7,425,391 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 22 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Hulu New Releases: November 2021 Nov 1Den of Geek What’s Coming & Going From Hulu in November 2021 Oct 22TV Insider Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Beatriz at Dinner (2017) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
