Genres Action Crime Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for street racing, violence, language and some sensuality Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Universal Studios had two different scripts commissioned. The first script featured Vin Diesel's character, while the second script did not, in case he decided not to return. Goofs In the 'turbo-charged prelude', we see the now-rogue Brian O'Connor on national news, including reported sightings of him. It seems odd that a crime lord of Verone's standing wouldn't have watched the news for the past few months, and simply recognize O'Connor when he sees him. Quotes Brian O'Connor: So, Dunn, looks like we're gonna be partners, bro. Could you tell me right quick what would be a better motor for my Skyline, a Gallo 12 or a Gallo 24? Agent Dunn: Um... [clears throat] Agent Dunn: 24? Brian O'Connor: I didn't know pizza places made motors. Crazy credits The Universal logo turns silver and spins into a hubcap. Alternate versions On newer U.S. broadcasts of the film (as of 2008), all Pepsi logos have been removed. Most notable is the scene where the gold Supra crashes on the billboard sign after jumping the bridge. The Pepsi sign is replaced with a blank blue wall.

This film brings back more of what we loved from the first film with all the cars, girls, and action and multiplies it. However it is still inferior to the first film but that dosen't mean it isn't awesome. This movie has gotten a lot of criticism and i don't understand why there is so much hate for this movie. Some people complained about the lack of plot and the casts acting skills but I don't care about that. I watch these Fast films to be entertained and I was throughly entertained with this one. Even though it dosen't match up to the original it still excels in excitement. I mean how could you go wrong with taking the series to Miami were our eyes will be blessed with dozens of beautiful beach girls. And the races in this movie are also very exciting to. And let's not forget the awesome chase sequence in the film as well. Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson make a great team and show us why this movie is so cool. I still love this movie despite the many negative reviews I've seen and to all the haters I say forget about the plot and just enjoy the perks. This movie is made for entertainment not Oscar awards and as far as entertainment goes It was grade A popcorn style. helpful•13 4 daniel_velker May 23, 2013 FAQ6 What is "2 Fast 2 Furious" about?
