Not even protectors like Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, the Flash, Hawkgirl or the Martian Manhunter may have a chance alone. But together as the Justice League, they are a metahuman force (and a hope) to be reckoned with. —RSchaff-2nd shared universedc animated universecartoon networksupernatural powersuperhuman strength45 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Animation Action Adventure Drama Family Fantasy Mystery Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia When developing the show, Bruce Timm briefly toyed with the idea of giving the Justice League a uniformed look to their costumes. When Timm mentioned it to DC President Paul Levitz, he said, "Not the big three (Superman, Wonder Woman, and Batman). You can do it to Green Lantern, you can do Flash, but not the big three." The designs were later used as the basis for the Justice Lords costumes. Goofs Green Lantern's ring disappears in many shots.
