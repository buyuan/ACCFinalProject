Preening himself as a real "hustler", he finds that he is the one getting "hustled" until he teams up with down-and-out but resilient outcast Ratso Rizzo. The initial "country cousin meets city cousin" relationship deepens. In their efforts to bilk a hostile world rebuffing them at every turn, this unlikely pair progress from partners in shady business to comrades. Each has found his first real friend. —alfiehitchie new york cityhustlergigolocowboyhomosexual269 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Whatever you hear about Midnight Cowboy is true. Genre Drama Certificate X Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Before Dustin Hoffman auditioned for this film, he knew that his all-American image could easily cost him the job. To prove he could do it, he asked the auditioning film executive to meet him on a street corner in Manhattan, and in the meantime, dressed himself in filthy rags. The executive arrived at the appointed corner and waited, barely noticing the "beggar" less than ten feet away who was accosting people for spare change. At last, the beggar walked up to him and revealed his true identity. Goofs When Joe Buck is hungry and destitute, he stops in a diner and sits with a weird mother and son. The son looks at the tracking camera not once, but twice, before dialog resumes. Easily edited, but left in, maybe on purpose. Quotes Ratso Rizzo: I'm walking here! I'm walking here! Alternate versions ABC edited 25 minutes from this film for its 1974 network television premiere.

It's not a meet cute in the classic sense of the word but it's not far away from it either. It's also a melodrama, operatic but hidden in a reality that can't possibly be real. Dustin Hoffman is as bold as Bette Davis in a Warner Brothers melodrama. Amazing. And Jon Voight? - He wasn't the first choice, Michael Sarrazin was. Jon Voight plays his whore with a heart of gold with the decency of a Mary Astor in another melodrama from the the 40's. I've seen Midnight Cowboy 5 times, the first time in a theater, three other times in VHS or DVD - Last night I saw it in a huge screen in the house of a friend. HD I believe and, Oh my God. I wept. I was taken over completely by this two devastating, truly devastating characters. John Schlesiger the director, a genius. British by birth but he showed us an America that most people didn't know existed, not even Americans. This is a film for the ages. helpful•61 7 alanbenfieldjr Jun 27, 2017 FAQ7 What is 'Midnight Cowboy' about? Is 'Midnight Cowboy' based on a book? What was wrong with Ratso?
