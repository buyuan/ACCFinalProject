Quotes Ted Maul: Kids burst shops by filling them with rice, and pouring in water: then standing back and laughing, while the bricks are ripped apart by the swelling food. Alternate versions When the show first aired in 1997, some of the more controversial sketches were cut on the orders of the then-head of Channel 4 programming Michael Grade, most notably a piece concerning a musical based on the life of and starring the serial killer Peter Sutcliffe. The edition of the show in which the sketch would have featured was allegedly broadcast containing a onscreen subliminal message lasting 1/25 of a second that read "Grade is a cunt". The series was repeated in 2001 with the Sutcliffe sketch and some other material shown uncut, and with the subliminal message removed. Connections Featured in Storm Over 4 (1998) User reviews25 Review Top review 10/10 Chris Morris you beauty! Quick review. All episodes are brilliant. The best one isn't the over-hyped paedophilia one. Nor is it the excellent one one drugs. The brilliant animals episode comes close. The one that made me almost wet myself was the one on science. The level of stupidity shown by 'celebs' on this one breaks new ground. There is a line regarding strong winds that reduced me to tears. You couldn't get way with this show anymore. A real shame. More convincing than Paxman. More ruthless than Sasha Baron Cohen. More intelligent than Stephen Hawkins. Absolute genius. Thank you Mr Morris! helpful•12 2 neil-arsenal Jun 10, 2011 Details Edit Release date January 29, 1997 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Language English Also known as BrassEye Production company TalkBack Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 25 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Related news From a Brookside kiss to ‘sadistic’ foreign films: Channel 4’s 20 most groundbreaking – and controversial – shows Jun 30The Guardian - TV News ‘We did our bit to get Biden elected’: Peter Baynham on writing for Borat, Brass Eye and Alan Partridge Jun 15The Guardian - TV News Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Brass Eye (1997) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
