Genres Animation Action Adventure Comedy Drama Family Fantasy Horror Mystery Sci-Fi Thriller Certificate TV-Y7 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The show uses backwards messages, riddles, and a variety of codes and cryptograms for viewers to crack in order to uncover secret messages. These messages can be found in plain sight at the end of the credits in every episode and hidden throughout the actual episodes. Sometimes the messages can be decoded into something comical, but other times it will be something more serious that will reveal hints and important clues for future episodes or even extra lore on the story and characters. According to Alex Hirsch, the codes for every episode are written out by him and inserted into the episode at the last minute. Goofs Throughout the series, the Dinosaur Skull's (Probably a Tyrannosaurus skull) Fenestra (Hole in front of the eye hole) keeps changing shape along with its location on the skull. Quotes [repeated line] Cute Biker: Get 'em! Get 'em! Crazy credits There is a cryptogram during the credits of each episode. Alternate versions Some foreign versions have the picture on Stan's fez removed. Cryptograms shown at the very end of the episode's credits may also be removed. Connections Featured in WatchMojo: Top 10 Hated Disney Animated Shows (2014) Soundtracks Gravity Falls Theme Composed by Brad Breeck (as Brad Breek) User reviews286 Review Top review 9/10 Gravity Falls: a Diamond in the Disney Channel Rough There are few things I hate more on television than the Disney Channel. This factory of mediocrity has churned out "gems" like The Suite Life with Zach and Cody and the unfortunately popular Hanna Montana. The Disney Channel is a place for Uncle Walt's successors to push talentless teens out in front of the world. Said teens get a few moments of fame and the Mouse gets another few million. Why do I make this cynical and cliché critique of the Disney Channel? Because I want to make sure every person who reads this understands how shocked and delighted I am by Gravity Falls. Gravity Falls takes place in a remote Oregon town of the same name. It features Dipper and Mabel Pines (voiced by Jason Ritter and Kristen Schaal respectively), a pair of twins, staying with their Great Uncle (or Grunkle, a term I believe needs to be used more often) Stan (voiced by show creator Alex Hirsch), a sleazy con-artist that runs a tourist trap called the Mystery Shack. Stan rips off gullible vacationers and townies with "supernatural" attractions and a less than stellar gift shop, overseen by man-child Soos (also voiced by Hirsch) and a down-to-earth slacker teenager Wendy (voiced by Linda Cardellini). It looks like a dull summer for the twins, but they soon find out that there is quite a lot of strange goings on in the little town. This show has that right mix of humor and adventure every family program ought to have. It's written in a way that can engage people of all ages without pandering to anyone. The voice actors were chosen masterfully, especially in Mabel Pines. I can't imagine anyone else but Schaal (who also voiced Trixie in Toy Story 3 and plays Mel in Flight of the Conchords)playing the bubbly, effervescent Mabel. This show also features DIY voice acting from Hirsch, a seemingly common occurrence in animated shows today (Regular Show creator JG Quintel voicing Mordecai and High Five Ghost and Adventure Time creator Pen Ward voicing Lumpy Space Princess as well as a myriad of side characters). Hirsch shows quite a bit of range voicing miserly Stan and obvious Soos. Gravity Falls is also able juxtapose the supernatural and the normal growing pains of adolescence. On a nearly weekly basis, the observant and intelligent Dipper finds a way to crack a mystery involving gnomes and crystals that change an object's size, yet he can't muster the courage to ask his crush, Wendy, on a date. There are a lot of TV shows and movies that try so hard to reach that sweet spot where they can appeal to kids, parents and young adults, but fall painfully short. Gravity Falls, though, hits that spot brilliantly. Like his fellow CalArts alumni Quintel and Ward, Hirsch's product is one made out of love and care and it's made clear in every episode. Most impressively, though, is that it gives me a reason to watch the Disney Channel. helpful•89 15 newkidontheblock Feb 1, 2013 FAQ1 Is Gravity Falls going to have a second season?
