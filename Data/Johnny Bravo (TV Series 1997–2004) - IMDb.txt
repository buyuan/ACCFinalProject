With spoofs of Schoolhouse Rock! (1973), The Twilight Zone (1959), and other television shows and movies, Johnny Bravo, along with his mother Bunny (Brenda Vaccaro) and his cute neighbor Suzy (Mae Whitman), Johnny learns more about life - the hard way. —Ian Pugh cartoon networkmale objectificationsupernatural power1990s2000s32 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Animation Short Adventure Comedy Family Certificate TV-Y7 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Johnny Bravo's pompadour was based on Brad Pitt's outrageous hairstyle in Johnny Suede (1991). Quotes Kid: [shouts] Look, Mommy! That guy's looking at pictures of almost naked men! [the whole store stares at Johnny] Johnny Bravo: This is a men's fitness magazine, I want to look *like* this, not at this... I've got nothin' to be ashamed of! [walks up to cashier ashamed, and drops change on the counter] Johnny Bravo: ... TV Guide. Connections Featured in I Am Sam (2001) User reviews49 Review Top review It was so good! You know, I was a HUGE Johnny Bravo fan. It was an extremely witty animated program that (like Garfield and Friends, Anamainiacs, and Tiny Toons) was kind of a "satire 101" for my generation. I remember when I would look forward to every Friday night at 9 (?) because Johnny Bravo would come on. This blonde Elvis wanna be charmed the country with his hilarious attempt at love, then getting something shoved down his paints or a hard object over his head. Then 2000 rolled around and with a new century came new characters, thus the demise of the Johnny Bravo I know and love. It was almost reincarnated as this awful mindless program that made Johnny look almost retarded. Of course they would put old Johnny Bravo in re-runs, for a while, but then they stopped. About a year ago I entirely gave up on The Cartoon Network (with the exception to Family Guy, Futurama, Aqua Teen Hungerforce, Sealab 2021, and Harvey Birdman: A.A.L). The station that once brought classic and sometimes kind of edgy original cartoons, is now a mindless output system of mostly substandard anamie cartoons. So in conclusion, please bring Johnny Bravo to its former, FUNNY self. helpful•23 5 newkidontheblock Aug 28, 2004 Details Edit Release date July 7, 1997 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Cartoon Network (Germany) The Cartoon Network Department of Cartoons: Johnny Bravo Language English Also known as Cxhn Ni Bra Wo Filming locations Burbank, California, USA Production companies Hanna-Barbera Productions Cartoon Network Studios Frederator Studios See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 30 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 1.33 : 1 Related news Billie Hayes, Witchiepoo in ‘H.R.
