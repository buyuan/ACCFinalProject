During the following hard years, Veronika who serves her country as a wartime-nurse will lose communication with Boris, moreover, when a devastating air raid destroys her house and Boris' father takes her in to live with the family, unexpectedly, things will take a turn for the worse. Before long, the worried fiancée will find herself dealing not only with the dark thoughts of Boris' potential loss but also with the burden of an unwelcome decision. Once, the star-crossed lovers swore eternal devotion under a flock of flying cranes, still, a war is always cruel and eternally disastrous. —Nick Riganas crane the birdmoscow russialoveless marriagemissing in actionair raid shelter87 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines So Much to Love - So Little Time Genres Drama Romance War Certificate Not Rated Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia One of the most notable features of the film is cinematographer Sergey Urusevskiy's then ground-breaking use of hand-held cameras. He had learned how to film like this when he was a military cameraman during the war. Quotes Stepan: Dear mother, father, sisters and brothers! The happiness of our reunion is immeasurable. The heart of every Soviet citizen is filled with joy. Joy sings in our hearts. It is victory that has brought us this joy. We have all waited for this moment. But we shall not forget those left behind on the battlefield. Time will pass. Towns and villages will be rebuilt. Our wounds will heal. But our fierce hatred of war will never diminish. We share the grief of those who cannot meet their loved ones today, and we will do everything to insure that sweethearts are never again parted by war, that mothers need never again fear for their children's lives, that fathers need never again choke back hidden tears. We have won, and we shall live not to destroy, but to build a new life! Connections Edited into Nitrato d'argento (1996) User reviews83 Review Top review 8/10 Remarkable for its time While watching this film recently, I constantly had to remind myself that it was made in 1957..........and in the USSR! That makes it all the more remarkable. Many of the cinematographic effects in the film seem cliched in 2002, but they were quite original in 1957. I first saw this film in 1963, when it was first released in the US, and I was struck by its originality then. Now just having seen it 40 years later, I have no reason to change my mind. helpful•37 14 wjfickling Nov 30, 2002 Details Edit Release date October 12, 1957 (Soviet Union) Country of origin Soviet Union Official site Mosfilm [rus] Language Russian Also known as The Cranes Are Flying Filming locations Mosfilm Studios, Moscow, Russia Production company Mosfilm See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross US & Canada $17,923 Gross worldwide $17,923 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 35 minutes Color Black and White Sound mix Mono Aspect ratio 1.37 : 1 Related news Ashes and Diamonds Aug 14Trailers from Hell The Past is a Foreign Country: Andrei Konchalovsky on “Dear Comrades!” Feb 2MUBI Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Letyat zhuravli (1957) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
