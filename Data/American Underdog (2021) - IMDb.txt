The film centers on Warner's unique story and years of challenges and setbacks that could have derailed his aspirations to become an NFL player - but just when his dreams seemed all but out of reach, it is only with the support of his wife, Brenda (Anna Paquin) and the encouragement of his family, coaches, and teammates that Warner perseveres and finds the strength to show the world the champion that he already is. —Lionsgate supermarketbased on real peoplereference to kurt warnerst. louis ramsnfl15 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Some Dreams Become Destiny Genres Biography Drama Sport Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG for some language and thematic elements Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia Second collab with Zachary Levi and Adam Baldwin who were in the TV show Chuck.
