Filming did not begin until February 2019 and wrapped four months later in May, for a December release only seven months later. Most films complete filming nearly a year before their release. Goofs When Fridge (as Professor Shelly Oberon) jumps to the last floating bridge, he twists his right ankle and is shown limping with his right leg while he is on land. Yet, later on, when Spencer (as Ming Fleetfoot) is tending to Fridge's injury, he is wrapping Fridge's left ankle. Quotes Mouse Finbar: Did I die and turn into a small muscular boy scout? Crazy credits At the end of the credits, the Jumanji drums can be heard along with herds of Ostriches running in the real world.
