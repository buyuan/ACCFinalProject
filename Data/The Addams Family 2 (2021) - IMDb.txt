In this all new movie we find Morticia and Gomez distraught that their children are growing up, skipping family dinners, and totally consumed with "scream time." To reclaim their bond they decide to cram Wednesday, Pugsley, Uncle Fester and the crew into their haunted camper and hit the road for one last miserable family vacation. Their adventure across America takes them out of their element and into hilarious run-ins with their iconic cousin, It, as well as many new kooky characters. What could possibly go wrong? —MGM sequelsecond partcgi animationaddams family charactersfamily relationships17 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines A sequel. How original. Genres Animation Adventure Comedy Family Fantasy Horror Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG for macabre and rude humor, violence and language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Finn Wolfhard could not reprise his role as Pugsley Addams in this film due to his voice changing, so Javon 'Wanna' Walton was cast. Goofs As in the previous film, Cousin Itt's name is again misspelled as "It." Quotes Pugsley Addams: Where have you been all my life? Ophelia: The farm. Crazy credits The closing credits show the Addams Family on the family trip around the world, including Pisa, the Great Wall of China, Sydney, Yucatan, Paris, Moscow, The Pyramids of Giza, London, Delhi etc, accompanied by "The Addams Family Theme". The lyrics are shown on the bottom and Thing is showing them in order for the sing-a-long. Connections Featured in AniMat's Crazy Cartoon Cast: Barney's Big Blockbuster (2019) Soundtracks Addams Family Theme Written by Vic Mizzy User reviews104 Review Top review 5/10 Boring and we were glad it was over when it was done I watched this with kids and we all didn't really get into this this one. The first one was much much better, but this was feeling very disjointed and the jokes were lame/not funny. I was expecting it to be much better, unfortunately it wasn't. I think the only fun scene was Niagara Falls , and only because we know that area so it was interesting. helpful•24 8 psxp Oct 2, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 1, 2021 (Canada) Countries of origin United States Canada Official site Official Site Languages English Spanish Latin Also known as Gia Đình Addams 2 Production companies BRON Studios BermanBraun Bron Creative See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross US & Canada $56,042,041 Opening weekend US & Canada $17,325,007 Oct 3, 2021 Gross worldwide $110,729,041 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 33 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news ‘No Time to Die,’ ‘Venom,’ ‘Dune’ Drive U.K. October Box Office to $214 Million, Annual Gross at $557 Million Nov 5Variety Film + TV A Weaker ‘Eternals’ Box Office Is Just One of Many Issues in Likely November Slowdown Nov 4Indiewire Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Japanese language plot outline for The Addams Family 2 (2021)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
