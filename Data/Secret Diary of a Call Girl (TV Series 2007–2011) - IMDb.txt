Quotes Thug: So... I'm... I think I want it in missionary? I think? Well... Belle: Are you nervous? Thug: Yeah. Belle: Don't be. Spit it out your desires. Be free. I'm all yours tonight. Do me what you want. Thug: Allright. I want to fuck you with my cock until you cum. I wanna put a dynamite to your pussy and make you explode with orgasm! I wanna fuck you from behind and eat your shit! I want you to suck my coc... Belle: OK! I got it! Well... How about we start from the fucking me from behind? Connections Featured in Screenwipe: Episode #4.2 (2007) Soundtracks You Know I'm No Good (Theme Song) Written and Performed by Amy Winehouse User reviews31 Review Top review 7/10 Different and Fun When I watched the first episode I will admit I was rather scandalized. The sex is pretty graphic and they don't sugar coat too much. However, as the series went on I found myself really enjoying the characters and dying to know what would happen to Belle next. The life of a prostitute seems anything but glamorous in modern society but with in this show it was portrayed in a fun and fresh way. This is not the show for everyone but for something fluffy to watch with some Hagen Daas and your girlfriends its rather enjoyable. I would have appreciated more character build up with more overlapping characters. However, keeping in mind that it was only 8 - twenty minute episodes I have high hopes for season two. Very Sex and the City. Only British ... and starring Samantha. helpful•50 17 carms89 Jan 17, 2008 FAQ5 A NOTE REGARDING SPOILERS Is this show based on a book? What does "Belle de Jour" mean?
