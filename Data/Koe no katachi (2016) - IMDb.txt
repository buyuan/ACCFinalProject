Genres Animation Drama Certificate Not Rated Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Shoko's English dub voice actress Lexi Marman is actually deaf in real life. Goofs During Ishida and Ueno's conversation at the crosswalk, Nishimiya is seen holding the pouch that Ishida had given to her as a gift. However, it disappears after Ueno sprints across the street and removes Nishimiya's earpiece; it is nowhere to be seen on her person or on the ground. Quotes Miyoko Sahara: I couldn't change. I couldn't protect you again. I was the same coward. Shoko Nishimiya: You can change from now on. Crazy credits Though the official Roman-character title used on merchandise in Japan, and on the movie's posters, trailers, video boxes, video menus and so on in English-speaking countries is "A Silent Voice: The Movie" (often shortened to just "A Silent Voice"), the Roman-character title which appears on-screen in the full movie itself is instead "The Shape of Voice", which is an awkward mistranslation into English of "Koe no katachi". Connections Edited from Moga Bunda Disayang Allah (2013) Soundtracks My Generation Written by Pete Townshend Performed by The Who User reviews316 Review Top review 9/10 I felt like crying for no reason.. The visual storytelling is powerful and effective soundtrack, you don't even need to read the subtitles to know what the characters are saying. But I felt sad for that girl. There is a huge shock in this movie. How people change. How much a person can be loved. As a teenager I have much more things to learn. Probably If I'll have time I will watch it twice. Even I fall in love with ANIME after watched this. helpful•100 5 D0M1N4T1NG Dec 1, 2017 FAQ2 Why did Ishida's sister not want to be show her face?
