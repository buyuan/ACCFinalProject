Tensions between these city-states boil over with the creation of hextech a way for any person to control magical energy in Piltover, and in Zaun, a new drug called shimmer transforms humans into monsters. The rivalry between the cities splits families and friends as Arcane brings life to the relationships that shape some of League of Legends' famous champions including Vi, Jinx, Caitlyn, Jayce and Viktor. arcaneriot gamesleague of legendsanimated seriesruneterra36 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Every legend has a beginning.
