Genres Animation Comedy Drama Romance Sci-Fi Thriller Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Okabe gives Kurisu several nicknames over the course of Steins;Gate, only calling her by her real name in serious situations. Kurisu's most frequent nicknames are "Assistant" or "Christina" (by adding '-tina' to 'Kurisu'), but Okabe also calls her "The Zombie", "Money Bags", "@Channeler", "Mongolian Spot", "Experiment Loving Girl", "Perverted Genius Girl", "Experiment Loving Perverted Genius Girl", "Celeb Seventeen". Even though Kurisu seems to hate being nicknamed, she thinks it's hopeless to point that out to Okabe. Goofs Okabe usually doesn't have shoes on in the lab, yet when he walks around you hear the sound of shoes stepping on the floor. A strange goof for such a well-made anime. Quotes Rintarou Okabe: It's the choice of Steins Gate.

Well enough flattering and let me give suggestions why you should watch this series.Firstly the plot is awesome.I haven't seen any 'time-travel' topic like in this anime.With every passing episode,you left with wanting to see and learn more.Characters fits the show perfectly.Their relation with each other and their progress through the series is worth watching. Voice actors did their job very well.And I love the combination of comedy-drama-action trio.They pulled it so good. All in all,it's a worth watching series and highly recommend for anyone who wants to see something different in an anime,you won't regret it. helpful•156 22 irtelam Sep 14, 2011 Details Edit Release date April 6, 2011 (Japan) Country of origin Japan Official site Official site (Japan) Languages Japanese English Also known as Брама;Штейна Filming locations Chicago Illinois, USA Production companies Frontier Works Future Gadget Lab See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 24 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
