Each week presents one to three tales about some unusual situation that turns out to be even more unusual than initially suspected. Whether the tone of the story is horror, suspense, or humor, there is always a surprise twist at the end. —Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net> sequelpsychotronicsupernaturalsurrealismanthology Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Drama Fantasy Horror Mystery Sci-Fi Thriller Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The series' first narrator Charles Aidman previously appeared in two episodes of The Twilight Zone (1959). He played Colonel Ed Harrington in And When the Sky Was Opened (1959) and Bill in Little Girl Lost (1962). Alternate versions Original network episodes ran one hour, with two or three stories per instalment. These episodes were reedited into half hour episodes for syndication along with newly produced half-hour episodes, with each half hour consisting of a single story from the original one-hour version. Connections Featured in Science Fiction: A Journey Into the Unknown (1994) User reviews39 Review Top review As good as the original While many whill claim this as the superior series or vice versa, the reality of the matter is that this series tends to stand on its own two feet. With darker and more modern stories, the regular Joe who might have felt alienated by the original series. One could relate to the power and delicious eeriness of this new collection of nail biting stories and haunting epithets of fear. Very few shows these days put the same amount of passion into a series like this one did for the longest time. Hopefully, the newest incantation will be just as good as the first two. I will state this though, the 1980s version of the theme song and the opening was much better than the original. helpful•11 10 Agent10 Jul 23, 2002 Details Edit Release date September 27, 1985 (United States) Countries of origin United Kingdom Canada United States Language English Also known as Unbekannte Dimensionen Filming locations 4th Street Viaduct, Los Angeles, California, USA Production companies Atlantis Films CBS London Film Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 45 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 4:3 Related news Norman S.
