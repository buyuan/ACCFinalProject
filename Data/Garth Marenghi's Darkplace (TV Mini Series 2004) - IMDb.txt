At least that's what Marenghi and his publicist/co-star, Dean Learner, claim in modern-day interviews which both bookend and interrupt the episodes. In fact the show is cheap, chiché'd, full of gaping plot holes and startlingly misogynist. Garth Marenghi is a creation of comedian Matthew Holness, who won a Perrier award with the character at the 2001 Edinburgh festival. —Richard Smeltzer tv mini seriescringe comedyhospitalinterview1980s15 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines From the best-selling master of darkness Genres Comedy Fantasy Horror Sci-Fi Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The series was shown in 2004 on the UK's Channel 4 network, but a second series was never commissioned due to low ratings. However over the next few years the series gained a considerable cult following via word-of-mouth and the Internet. Renewed interest in the show led to it being released on DVD and subsequent airings in the US on the Sci-Fi and Adult Swim networks. Currently fans are petitioning for a second season of the show. Quotes Dean Learner: She was like a candle in the wind... unreliable. Crazy credits The credits are all in an 80s style and use the old Channel 4 logo. Connections Featured in Bad Movie Beatdown: Reckoning Day (2011) User reviews69 Review Top review 9/10 say you were there first time round - watch it now I wasn't fully sure what to expect and nearly didn't watch it at all, that would have been a mistake. Three episodes in and I'm hooked and I'm slowly working on all my friends too as it would be a shame if this slipped by without getting the audience it deserves. I was a bit concerned after the first episode that the jokes would quickly wear a bit thin but this hasn't proved to be the case. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea but well worth trying because if it is you're in for one of the funnier half hours of television you'll see all week. helpful•19 8 sscsgh Feb 16, 2004 FAQ1 Why doesn't Madeline Wool speak in any of the interviews?
