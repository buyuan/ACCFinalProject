Vincent Hanna and his team of cops in the Robbery/Homicide police division. A botched job puts Hanna onto their trail while they regroup and try to put together one last big 'retirement' score. Neil and Vincent are similar in many ways, including their troubled personal lives. At a crucial moment in his life, Neil disobeys the dictum taught to him long ago by his criminal mentor--'Never have anything in your life that you can't walk out on in thirty seconds flat, if you spot the heat coming around the corner'--as he falls in love. Thus the stage is set for the suspenseful ending.... —Tad Dibbern <DIBBERN_D@a1.mscf.upenn.edu> gun battleorganized crimehonorcriminal investigationtaken in for questioning209 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines An L.A. Redemption Genres Action Crime Drama Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for violence and language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Rather than dubbing in the gunshots during the bank robbery shoot-out, Michael Mann had microphones carefully placed around the set so that the audio could be captured live. This added to the impact of the scene, because it sounded like no other gunfight shown on-screen. Goofs In the final scene, the approach light system at LAX airport is shown turning on and off for individual aircraft as they approach to land. In actuality, approach lights to runways remain lit at the same level of intensity for aircraft. They are not turned 'up' and 'down' for each airplane. Quotes Vincent Hanna: My life's a disaster zone. I got a stepdaughter so fucked up because her real father's this large-type asshole. I got a wife, we're passing each other on the down-slope of a marriage - my third - because I spend all my time chasing guys like you around the block. That's my life. Neil McCauley: A guy told me one time, "Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner." Now, if you're on me and you gotta move when I move, how do you expect to keep a... a marriage? Alternate versions Director Michael Mann made two minor changes to the film for the Blu-ray release: During Justine's conversation with Vincent at the restaurant, her line "You sift through the detritus" has been removed and instead a silent reaction shot of Vincent was inserted. Vincent's line "Ferocious, aren't I?", said after he screams at Alan Marciano, has been removed. Since only the audio was changed, the image stayed the same.

By Arrangement with PolyGram Film & TV Licensing User reviews1.2K Review Top review 10/10 Heat is truly epic, absolutely breathtaking One of the most amazing things about Heat is the scale of the film; it is nearly three hours long and packed to bursting with mind-blowing visuals. It seems one of Michael Mann's main priorities was to make a film with a dreamlike feel to it, to portray LA as a dusty oil-painting on which complex characters could play out their lives. One of the main themes is the similarity of the career criminal and the street-wise cop. It is fascinating to find yourself really feeling for DeNiro's tragic bank-robber, a man of philosophical merit who realises he's stuck in a life of crime he doesn't want to lead. Pacino's cop is less easy to sympathise with, but he too leads an in-escapable life of guns and crime. What really stands out is the climax. On the whole, Heat has to be the best cops n' robbers film ever made, indeed, one of the best films. An epic, wonderful, sad, adrenaline-fuelled exercise in scale and grandeur. helpful•545 114 jamie-109 Feb 17, 2000 FAQ22 What was in the package that VanZant sends with his guy to the drive-in theatre? why would they take all that time looking for bonds and not take any cash from the armor truck? and then they tried to sell the bonds back to the original owner? tha'ts downright retarded When does the movie take place?
