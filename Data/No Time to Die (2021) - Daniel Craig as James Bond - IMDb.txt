James Bond : We all have our secrets. We just didn't get to yours yet. MI6 Security Guard : Name? James Bond : Bond. [Clerk looks up] James Bond : James Bond. Blofeld : James, fate draws us back together. Now your enemy is my enemy. How did that happen? James Bond : Well, you live long enough. Q : So you're not dead? James Bond : Hello, Q. I've missed you. Lyutsifer Safin : The thing that no one wants to admit is that most people want things to happen to them. We tell each other lies about the fight for free will and independence, but we don't really want that. We want to be told how to live and then die when we're not looking. People want oblivion, and a few of us are born to build it for them. So here I am - their invisible god sneaking under their skin. James Bond : You know, history isn't kind to men who play God. Lyutsifer Safin : And you don't? We both eradicate people to make the world a better place. I just want it to be... tidier. Lyutsifer Safin : James Bond. History of violence, license to kill, vendetta with Ernst Blofeld, in love with Madeleine Swann. I could be speaking to my own reflection. James Bond : We've made slightly different choices. Lyutsifer Safin : No. We've just developed different methods for the same goal. Only your skills die with your body. Mine will survive long after I'm gone. And life is all about leaving something behind, isn't it? James Bond : If we don't do this, there will be nothing left to save! James Bond : You have all the time in the world. James Bond : [at Vesper's grave] I miss you. James Bond : [to Q] I had to show someone your watch. It really blew their mind. Nomi : The world's moved on, Commander Bond. James Bond : You're a Double-O? Nomi : Two years. So stay in your lane. You get in my way, I will put a bullet in your knee... the one that works. Madeleine : She does have your eyes. James Bond : I know. I know... James Bond : Where'd you find The Book of Mormon? Logan Ash : Why don't you help me out, brother? James Bond : I had a brother. His name was Felix Leiter. James Bond : What is this, SPECTRE bunga-bunga? James Bond : The past isn't dead. James Bond : [to M, on Nomi] I've met your new 007. She's a disarming young woman. James Bond : If I don't come back, blow it all to shit. Nomi : We don't have enough explosives for that. James Bond : Yeah, but they don't know that. Lyutsifer Safin : I want the world to evolve, yet you want it to stay the same. Let's face it - I've made you redundant. James Bond : No. Not as long as there are people like you in the world. James Bond : [to Madeleine] You're right. Letting go is hard. James Bond : Can I talk to Madeline? Q : Of course. How stupid of me. James Bond : The callsign? Something about a hat? Paloma : Oh, I forget things when I'm nervous. Madeleine : How will I know you're okay? James Bond : You won't. You'll never see me again. James Bond : [last words] I know. James Bond : Die, Blofeld, die! M : I can't pretend there weren't some sorry faces when you left us, Bond, but you fell so far off the grid that we thought you must be dead. Now, learning that you were, in fact, alive and well, and... working for the CIA, well... Well, that really was a blow. James Bond : Well, they just asked so nicely.
