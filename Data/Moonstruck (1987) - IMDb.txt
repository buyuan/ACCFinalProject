She tries to resist, but Ronny lost his hand in an accident he blames on his brother, and has no scruples about aggressively pursuing her while Johnny is out of the country. As Loretta falls deeper in love, she comes to learn that she's not the only one in her family with a secret romance. —Jwelch5742 lovemarriage proposalartificial handnew york citymoon55 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Life. Family. Love. Genres Comedy Drama Romance Certificate PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Nicolas Cage's screen test didn't impress the studio, and they wanted to get someone else to play Ronny. But Cher insisted that Cage was the one to play that role, and threatened to quit unless he was hired. After a few days, the studio relented. Goofs Loretta says "ti amo" to her father, and he answers "ti amo." "I love you" is the accepted English translation, but "ti amo" refers only to romantic love, and would never be used between father and daughter. They would say "ti voglio bene" instead. Quotes Ronny Cammareri: Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love is, and I didn't know this either, but love don't make things nice - it ruins everything. It breaks your heart. It makes things a mess. We aren't here to make things perfect. The snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. Not us! We are here to ruin ourselves and to break our hearts and love the wrong people and *die*. The storybooks are *bullshit*. Now I want you to come upstairs with me and *get* in my bed! Crazy credits As the rest of the end credits roll, the moon is on the left side of the screen.

Music by Harry Warren (uncredited) Lyrics by Jack Brooks (uncredited) User reviews186 Review Top review 8/10 Cher is great 'Moonstruck' is a love story. There is not one romance, there are at least three, but they all have to do with the same family. Loretta's family. Loretta (Cher) is about to marry Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello). She doesn't love him, but he is sweet and good man. When he leaves to visit his dying mother in Italy Loretta meets Johnny's brother Ronny (Nicolas Cage). He and Johnny haven't spoken each other in five years and Loretta wants to invite him to the wedding. Of course they fall instantly for each other. How this story and love stories of Loretta's parents and uncle and aunt develop is something you simply have to see for yourself. Every seen is a delight to watch, with Cher as the bright star in the middle of everything. She won and really deserved the Oscar that year. Cage is pretty good, and goofy as well, and Olympia Dukakis as Loretta's mother and Vincent Gardenia as her father are terrific. This movie is funny, charming and therefore highly enjoyable. helpful•42 7 rbverhoef Feb 10, 2004 FAQ3 What does Loretta drop into the glasses of wine/champagne after it is poured? I've seen this movie twice now on Starz this past weekend and when Loretta tells Ronny after they spent the night together "You and I are going to take this to our grave." The word "grave" is either bleeped out or silent. I have the original movie on VHS and it's not bleeped out on the tape. I thought it was a fluke so I watched it again and it happened again. What's wrong with that phrase?
