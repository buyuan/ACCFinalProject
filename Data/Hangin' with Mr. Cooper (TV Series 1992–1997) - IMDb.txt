The scenes of Mark Curry playing were not specially scripted; he did, in fact, actually play in the game.

All of the cast was great, especially the star Mark Curry who was the funniest. I had many great moments laughing at this show. It is a classic show. Everything about this show was pure gold. I was saddened to know this show was cancelled. That was a shame. That is why I'm thankful for reruns. helpful•12 4 Op_Prime Jan 9, 2000 Details Edit Release date September 22, 1992 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Warner Bros.
