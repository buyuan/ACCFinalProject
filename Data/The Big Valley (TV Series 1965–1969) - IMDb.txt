Heath is the illegitimate son of Victoria's husband, Tom (who is dead at the time of the series). Bank robbers, horse thieves, revolutionaries, and land grabbers keep the Barkleys hopping. —Ed Stephan <stephan@cc.wwu.edu> mexicanmexicobusinessmenguitardeal33 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genre Western Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia According to "Wildest Westerns Magazine", Peter Breck was able to draw his gun in 16/100 of a second, making the character of Nick Barkley the fastest draw in television history. Goofs The series is apparently set during the administration of Ulysses S. Grant. However many of the years and dates mentioned during the series conflict with this setting. Quotes Nick Barkley: It might do you good to eat a little dust once in awhile. Jarrod Barkley: I'm a lawyer, remember? I only eat crow. Crazy credits Throughout the series, Lee Majors was always introduced as Heath in the credits, no last name. This was because, even though he was accepted as a member of the family, there was always the question of whether he was a true Barkley or not. Alternate versions Some second season syndication prints now have the first season's main title sequence. While similar in style, they use different shots. Such prints were aired in 2006-2008 on the Encore Westerns Channel and 2007-2009 on the American Life TV Network. Connections Featured in Barbara Stanwyck: Fire and Desire (1991) User reviews52 Review Top review Amazingly similar feelings After reading the comments of others who love The Big Valley, I feel less unusual for enjoying the old show so much. It totally captured my interest when I was a teenager, and I miss watching it, since I cannot locate it. It should have run longer, but I can understand the actors were afraid of typecasting, or had other plans. I love everything about the show, from the opening music, to the stars, to the clothes, and I really loved that house, especially the staircase. I dream of a house like that one. I was pleased to have Linda Evans go on to Dynasty, and to see Lee Majors as The Bionic Man. I hoped to see more of Peter Breck and the others. helpful•10 1 lisvictoria Jan 14, 2003 FAQ1 How many episodes did each of the five main stars appear in?
