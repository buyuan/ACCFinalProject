Genres Drama Horror Mystery Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for violence including gruesome images, and for language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia This film is based on the story "The Quiet Boy", written by Nick Antosca. Quotes Lucas Weaver: Once, there were three bears that lived in a dark and wet cave above a small town. Every day, Little Bear went to school, and at night he would come home and eat dinner. But one day, the little bear came home, and Big Bear and Baby Bear were different. Big Bear got sick and his insides turned black. Big Bear has become more angrier and meaner, because they had no food, no meat. But they had each other.

Packs a punch the rest of the way. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the mythology of the movie. Not too many movies have Native American Folklore in them. It's better than the cheesy horror movies out now. If you're looking for something different in the horror genera, I definitely recommend. helpful•3 0 onebengalcat Oct 31, 2021 FAQ2 when and where is this movie playing I've been curious to know why there have been so many release changes. The obvious answer would be waiting for the money from it's theatrical release, but for many of us who've been following it for more than a couple of years, it's starting to feel like a disappointment. I don't say that because I think the movie will not be good, but I've been teased and disappointed for way too long and it now might not be good enough. I really like all I know about it so far, perfect director and actors/actresses. Is there any reasonable answer that will make me go to the theater (and not just wait a little longer for it's release on HBO?)
