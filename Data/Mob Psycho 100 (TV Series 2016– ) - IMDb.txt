Alternate versions Cartoon Network LA and Brazil airings censored every sexual reference and nudity but left most of the violence and bloody images intact, along with the only instance of coarse language in the Spanish dub (CN LA first and only use of the word "mierda" ("shit"), removed in reruns). Connections Featured in Source Sort: The Switch Leak that fooled even Nintendo (Etika) (2020) User reviews76 Review Top review 8/10 When Animation Reaches 100% (Rating as an anime) Mob Psycho 100 is a phenomenon, engineered by a culmination of many talented people to be the most visually stunning experience that it could be. It is impossible to truly praise Mob Psycho without mentioning the animation, as it is one of the key reasons that the show is so great. Every action scene is gorgeous, with every vibrantly colored flash of light complimenting each fluid movement, this show goes all out. Not only does this show have amazing visual effects and excellent fighting choreography, but it also has some of the most expressive characters I've ever seen. Facial expressions are actually expressive rather than stagnant and lifeless. The show also introduces a lot of unique visual gags that actually made me laugh quite a few times. There's a lot more to be said about the animation, but there's also much to say about the writing. Mob Psycho 100 is a charming coming of age story about a boy with psychic powers learning to grow as a person, so that one day he will no longer need to rely on his psychic abilities. Mob is not physically strong, smart, popular, or attractive. He's socially awkward, and he wants nothing more than to be noticed by his peers. Despite all of his shortcomings, he never uses his psychic powers to attract attention to himself, in order to prove to himself that he is worth more than the powers that were handed to him. All of the conflicts in this show center around Mob's emotions. It's extremely charming and it leads to a lot of powerful moments that are genuinely moving. The show also has a pretty good sense of humor, with clever jokes placed throughout the show that have gotten a lot of genuine laughs from me. It's obvious that a lot of passion was put into Mob Psycho 100, and I'm rating it an 8/10. helpful•7 0 quentinwharton-70401 Dec 22, 2019 Details Edit Release date July 11, 2016 (Japan) Country of origin Japan Official site Official site (Japan) Language Japanese Also known as Моб Психо 100 Production company Bones See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 24 minutes Color Color Related news What We Know about Mob Psycho 100 Season 3 So Far Jul 20TVovermind.com Mob Psycho 100: 10 Best Episodes, According To IMDb Jul 5ScreenRant.com Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
