In "AFHV," host Saget provided commentary to the home videos which often showed wedding and sports bloopers, children and pets either being themselves or getting into trouble, furniture or other objects giving way (usually contributing to someone's fall) and "comical" reactions to getting inadvertently hit (usually in the groin). Sometimes, certain videos were grouped into themes, such as Christmas or a summer vacation, or had sentimental value to them, such as a marriage proposal; other times, videos were set to classic rock tunes. The top three videos of the week as selected by the producers were eligible for each week's $10,000 top prize; the audience would electronically vote for their one favorite video. Weekly winners got to compete in a later special for a $100,000 top prize. —Brian Rathjen <briguy_52732@yahoo.com> disneyabcvideoblooperaudience voting17 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Comedy Family Reality-TV Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia There have been 5 hosts in AFV history.

I used to like watching this show, when I was a mindless little tyke. Now that I am much older, I caught this on a TV rerun and thought to myself, "Is this supposed to be funny?". The videos that were sent in were funny, although much of them look as if they were staged. What made them unfunny and unentertaining was the gratuitous use of Bob Saget's voiceovers and music. I had to mute the TV to find the videos funny. My brothers and sisters never liked the show. Now that I am old enough, it's hard not to see why. helpful•5 6 andy-227 Jan 10, 2000 Details Edit Release date November 26, 1989 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites ABC Official Facebook Language English Also known as AFHV Filming locations Raleigh Manhattan Beach Studios - 1600 Rosecrans Avenue, Manhattan Beach, California, USA Production companies ABC Productions Vin Di Bona Productions Gotham Music Placement See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 30 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Related news 2021-22 TV Show Season Ratings (week eight) Nov 16TVSeriesFinale.com ABC 2021-22 TV Season Ratings (updated 11/16/2021) Nov 16TVSeriesFinale.com Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was America's Funniest Home Videos (1989) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
