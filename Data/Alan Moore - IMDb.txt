Personal Quote: ... it was done while I was doing Watchmen, or just after or something, I'm not sure which but it was too close to Watchmen. I mean, Brian [Bolland] did a wonderful job on the art but I don't think it's a very good book. It's not saying anything very interesting. -- on "The Killing Joke" See more » Trivia: His graphic novel ''Watchmen'' is listed on Time Magazine's list of ''The 100 greatest novels''.
