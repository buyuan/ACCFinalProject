I sure as hell didn't get any sense of what this film was about. That isn't always a bad thing it's just this film annoyed because of it as felt for a first time directing that Carlson has some real directing talent. I'm sure some sort of message was meant to be portrayed, I just found the end feeling I was left with was frustrating. It was pleasing to the eye and some scenes were quite well done, the music was good too. I've no doubt that Carlson will be making some very good films in the future. helpful•0 0 chilversedward Oct 29, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 15, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Deadline Announcement Language English Also known as العالم المشتعل Filming locations Austin, Texas, USA Production companies Greenbelt Films Tealhouse Entertainment American Stream Wave See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 41 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 Related news Oh no, not another killer in a cage!
