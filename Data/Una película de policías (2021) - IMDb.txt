In this thoroughly original and unpredictable documentary, Ruizpalacios plays with the boundaries of nonfiction and immerses the audience into the human experience of police work within a dysfunctional system. policepatrolcriminaljusticeprofessional13 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Documentary Action Crime Drama Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) - Rated R for language and brief sexuality. Parents guide Add content advisory User reviews2 Review Top review 9/10 I HATE COPS, I LOVE THIS MOVIE Finding love where there is none, have compassion for those who do not... Ruizpalacios plays with reality and shares this funny, romantic and sad story with us. There are many stories that have to be told, even more those that we don't want to hear. The film shows us the "other side" the one of the apparent enemy, who at the end of everything tells us (through comedy) that police and citizens are the same human beings with fears, feelings and a life full of questions. Teresa and Montoya, what can I say, thank you for taking me on this trip. Don Alonso Ruizpalacios, thank you for doing what you do and sharing it with us. And thank you AMBULANTE for bringing good and free cinema around México!!! helpful•1 0 Fernando_Gutz Nov 13, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 28, 2021 (Mexico) Country of origin Mexico Official site Official Netflix Language Spanish Also known as A Cop Movie Filming locations Mexico City, Mexico Production company No Ficción See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 47 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 1.78 : 1 Related news ‘Summer of Soul’ Takes Top Honor at Critics Choice Documentary Awards Nov 15Indiewire ‘A Cop Movie’: Fact, Fiction, and the Pursuit of Justice in Mexico City Nov 11Hollywood Insider - Substance & Meaningful Entertainment Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Brazilian Portuguese language plot outline for Una película de policías (2021)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
