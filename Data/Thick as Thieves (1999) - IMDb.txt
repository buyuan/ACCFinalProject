Genres Crime Drama Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for language, violence and some drug use Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia The turntable in Mackin's apartment is a Technics SL-1200MKII. The Technics logo on the shell is clearly covered with a black marker though, probably due to the lack of endorsement kickback. Goofs Among "Thanks to" (corporate contributors) in end titles: "Calvin Kelin", an obvious typo for Calvin Klein. Quotes Pointy: "You can take the bitch outta the ghetto, but you just can't take the bitch outta the ghetto!" Connections References Gone with the Wind (1939) Soundtracks Secret Sauce User reviews39 Review Top review Well crafted, quirky, ironic and darkly comic crime drama. What a great subtle and fresh movie. Best thing Alec Baldwin has done in years. Michael Jai White (Pointy) is going to be a star. Andre Braugher is superb. Excellent supporting cast includes Bruce Greenwood, Rebecca DeMornay, Ricky Harris and Janeane Garafolo. The new director, Scott Sanders, has got the right stuff.
