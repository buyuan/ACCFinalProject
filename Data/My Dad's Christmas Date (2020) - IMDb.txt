He struggles to understand her, she refuses to communicate with him. He wants to be involved in her life, she wants her own space. In one important aspect, however, David and Jules are separated from the rest of society: the death of Jules' mum, and David's wife, in a car crash two years previous. With both struggling to cope with the rigors of daily life in the wake of this devastating loss, Jules decides to take matters into her own hands. Creating profiles for David on multiple online dating platforms, Jules sets out to find her dad a partner and, for herself, someone with whom she can talk. The question is, in the search for a new mum, will Jules find her old dad? punctuation in titleholiday in titlechristmas movieapostrophe in titlechristmas in title7 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genre Comedy Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia Filmed in and around York, including St Peter's School which is the 4th oldest school in the world with alumni including Guy Fawkes.

I was flicking through the streaming services for something to watch and I came across this little gem. I didn't read much about it, the title sort of said enough, I just clicked to watch. I remember the father being from the Ellen sitcom too, so that was another pull. I was surprised to find that it was all in England, I thought it would have been in America. There are some lovely father and daughter scenes, funny and emotional at the same time, and some really nice winter scenes in and around York. I didn't expect it to have me crying as well, but it did. Nice acting, good cast, good script, some beautiful locations. Would highly recommend. A nice warm Christmas film to snuggle up on the sofa with. helpful•5 1 missundaztood9 Dec 15, 2020 Details Edit Release date November 6, 2020 (Poland) Country of origin United Kingdom Official site sales agent Language English Also known as Let There Be Love Filming locations York, UK Production companies Goldfinch Highfield Grange Studios MSR Media See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget £20,000,000 (estimated) See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 31 minutes Color Color Related news New on Netflix: November 2021 Releases Nov 1Den of Geek New on Netflix for November 2021 Oct 31Gold Derby Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the French language plot outline for My Dad's Christmas Date (2020)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
