Genres Animation Comedy Drama Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia In season two, the line "what are you doing here?" or a variation "what am I doing here?" is said at least once per episode. Goofs Bojack has a pool on his deck, but there is nothing beneath the deck to support it. Quotes Mr. Peanutbutter: Mr. Peanutbutter: The universe is a cruel, uncaring void. The key to being happy isn't the search for meaning; is to just keep yourself busy with unimportant nonsense, and eventually, you will be dead. Crazy credits After Todd breaks BoJack's bed in the first episode, the opening title sequence shows the corner of the bed being held up by books.

Netflix, in their continuing mission to provide premium content to their subscribers, has another hit on their hands with BoJack Horseman. I had some reservations before watching the first episode, because there hasn't been a great new animated series in several years now. But with such a great cast on board, I figured it was worth a try. So glad I did, because it ended up being the best original comedy I have seen in a while, animated or otherwise. It does not take long at all to get wrapped up in the story of BoJack, a has-been actor known for his role as a single dad in a popular early '90s sitcom. Having not acted in the 18 years since the show was canceled, he agrees to pen a memoir in an effort to relaunch his career. When confronted with the reality of how he is perceived by others, BoJack becomes desperate for acceptance and redemption from both the public and his inner circle. For the most part, people from normal walks of life are portrayed as humans, while the elite class like actors and their agents are portrayed as animals. It's a surprisingly effective method to humanize these characters to whom the common person does not easily relate. Will Arnett, Kristen Schaaf, Aaron Paul, and Amy Sedaris all give their characters a 3-dimensional quality that is difficult to achieve in a 2D platform like animation. It helps that it is wonderfully drawn, with many subtleties that reinforce each character's persona. Instead of a loosely assembled pile of anecdotal stories with characters that are just given a reason to exist, all the events during each episode contribute to the progress of the plot over the course of the first season. With episodes picking up exactly where the last one left off, the show feels more like a 3-act mini series than a TV show. That said, there are plenty of crass jokes and innuendo that will satisfy viewers who are not vested in the overall story. I am delighted that the series has been picked up for a second season and to see in what direction the story of BoJack and his inner circle takes us. helpful•142 12 english-bill-34-910037 Aug 31, 2014 Details Edit Release date August 22, 2014 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Official Fake site Language English Also known as Кінь БоДжек Production companies Tornante Company ShadowMachine Netflix See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 25 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news Critics Choice Awards Voters’ Guide: 2022 TV Races Heat Up, Thanks in Great Part to ‘Squid Game’ Nov 17Variety Film + TV Composer Joshua Moshier Taps Into Twisted Dynamic Between Psychiatrist & Client With Score For ‘The Shrink Next Door’ – Hear An Exclusive Track Nov 4Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
