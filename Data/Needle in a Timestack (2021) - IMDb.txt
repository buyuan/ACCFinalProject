Quotes Zoe Mikkelsen: What if you go back and change your past but you end up with no future? Soundtracks In the Beginning Written by Jeremy Steig User reviews21 Review Top review 5/10 Love story with a little sci-fi This tells the story of a couple who are very much in love but are split up permanently and forget each other in the present by an ex who goes back in time. The film isn't really about time travel. It's never really explained how it works or how people have come to just accept their lives regularly being altered by people messing around in the past. This is all love story and if people can still be in love if they don't remember each other. It's a bit slow and pretentious in places. I almost gave up after 5 mins. When I got to the end it felt more like achievement than satisfaction at a good film. It really felt like it could have been much better done. It's hard to really care about the characters so you feel cold against what is happening instead of being drawn in and involved. It should be a film you discuss about after but it's just lacking in something. It's worth a watch but it just really feels like it should have been a far bigger and better film. A waste as it's well acted and it's believable but not well executed. helpful•8 0 LLgoatJ Oct 17, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 14, 2021 (France) Country of origin United States Official site Official site Languages English Portuguese Also known as إبرة في حزمة الوقت Filming locations Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada Production companies BRON Studios Creative Wealth Media Finance Ember20 See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 51 minutes Color Color Related news Needle in a Timestack | Review Oct 18IONCINEMA.com ‘Bergman Island’ Debuts; ‘The Rescue’, ‘Lamb’ Expand After Brisk Open; NYC Gets A New Alamo Drafthouse – Specialty Preview Oct 15Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Needle in a Timestack (2021) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
