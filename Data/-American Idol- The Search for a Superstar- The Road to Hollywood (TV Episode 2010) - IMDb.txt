We get another look at Gen. Larry Platt and "Pants on the Ground" and the videos it inspired. We get a montage of people being told that they made bad song choices. Jessica who auditioned poorly in season 8 is back with a make-over and a plan to sing a song co-written by Simon called "Footprints in the Sand." She gets four yes's this time. We get a montage of "attention seekers" including Amanda who does voices, including Britney Spears. Her own voice is fine and is told that she has a good voice but that doesn't connect with them because she's such an "actress." They relent and gets four yes's for her version of "Good Morning Heartache." We get a montage of acrobats, belly dancers, and hula hoopers. Plus people who brought instruments even though they can't bring them into the audition room. Lee and Crystal didn't need them though they got through with "Ain't No Sunshine" and "Piece of My Heart." We get a montage of golden ticket fake-outs, including a vintage one from Daughtry. We get a montage of people who have auditioned previously. One named Lacey made it to the top 50. But, as we see in flashback, she was cut. So she tries again with "Over the Rainbow" and gets put through again with four yes's. Stephanie is on her 7th audition. It turns out that 7 is not her lucky number after all. Her rendition of "Fever" gets four no's. Posh, her idol, and Kara nicely give her a hug. We get a montage of 16 year olds including Rachel, Thaddeus and Genesis who all impressed the judges. We get a montage of the seven cities and different jobs that people hold including waiters and cops. Then a montage of "athletes." First is Adrian who, although he is 6'8" is not a basketball player but a swimmer with lots of "big" nicknames. He calls himself a "manflower." Oy. He is, predictably, not so good singing "Can't Help Falling in Love" in a Bronski Beat-esque falsetto. He gets three no's. Then there's Michael a ripped personal trainer who's wife is pregnant. He sings "Unchained Melody" and it's fine but not mind-blowing. He gets four yes's. DiDi is auditioning in memory of her late best friend Rebecca. We get to see pictures of them. She sings "Hey Jude" and the judges, including Avril, dig it. She starts to cry when she's done. She gets four yes's, one of which is "very small" from Simon. We get a montage of the ACTUAL show we are watching. Aaron is a tough backstory contestant who was saved from foster care by his aunt and uncle. He seems really nice. He sings "The Climb." He's very heartfelt. Four yes's. We get a montage of people's goals, to make people feel good, fame, etc. Kimberly claims she has a really good heart and will recycle and help children in Africa. She'll have to do those things as she does some other profession because she can't sing as evidenced by her version of "I Kissed a Girl." Three no's. Next is Shaddail who loves her mom and her mom loves her and always dreamed she'd be a singer. The dream dies now, however, thanks to her painful rendition of "Fallin." Four no's. We get a montage of crowds in different cities saying welcome. Our final singer of the night is Hope who was very poor as a child and has indomitable spirit. She's very sweet but, in this audition anyway, she's not an amazing singer. She does "I Hope You Dance." Four yes's. Ryan says 100,000 people auditioned overall and 181 got golden tickets to Hollywood.
