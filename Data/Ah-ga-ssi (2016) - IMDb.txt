Genres Drama Romance Thriller Certificate Not Rated Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Both Japanese and Korean were spoken in the film by the predominately Korean cast. Before shooting, the Korean actors were all assigned Japanese teachers to study the script and learn to speak Japanese. After the screening at Cannes, actress Kim Min-hee was applauded by Japanese journalists for her proficiency in Japanese. Goofs The Count uses a propane gas lighter. That was impossible in 1930. Quotes Lady Hideko: The daughter of a legendary thief, who sewed winter coats out of stolen purses. Herself a thief, pickpocket, swindler. The saviour who came to tear my life apart. My Tamako. My Sookee. Crazy credits During the credits, the moon on the wall in the background shifts from full to new. Alternate versions Extended version runs approx. 21 minutes longer. Connections Featured in The EE British Academy Film Awards (2018) Soundtracks The Song at the End of the Century Performed by Kim Tae-ri (P) 2016 CJ E&M MUSIC User reviews294 Review Top review 10/10 Just amazing "The Handmaiden" is a crazily imaginative and beautiful movie by Chan-wook Park, who is at the top of his game in this story of a pickpocket that tries to steal the fortune of a naive, innocent rich woman that has been secluded in a mansion in the middle of nowhere. Of course, things will start to get complicated soon enough. Chan-wook Park has done a great job in adapting the original novel by Sarah Waters, and mixing it with the history of the Japanese invasion of Korea at the beginning of the twentieth century. The plot is a little bit silly sometimes, but Chan-wook Park makes it all tight and fast-paced, and even the most silly moment becomes a moment of beauty and fun. From the first moment, the viewer will be enthralled by the story of these two women and their relationship, and every plot development will just add fun to the whole. If the plot and the direction weren't amazing enough, the movie is as beautiful as they come. From the darkest moment, the most violent, to the most intimate, beauty transpires in every frame, and every scene comes to life and threatens to pop and break free from the screen. This is helped by the amazing work of all the cast, who does an incredible job in bringing this tale to life (it could be criticized, though, some of the heavily accented Japanese, for characters that are supposed to be able to pass as them). All in all, "The Handmaiden" is proof that a movie can have a plot, amazing direction, acting, scenery, craziness and the most beautiful package possible. And even if it is almost two hours and a half long, it feels like a breeze. You will fall in love with this movie. Just plain great. helpful•151 44 tenshi_ippikiookami Aug 5, 2016 Details Edit Release date June 1, 2016 (South Korea) Country of origin South Korea Official sites Official Facebook Official Facebook (United Kingdom) Languages Korean Japanese Also known as 小姐 Filming locations Nagoya, Aichi, Japan Production companies CJ Entertainment Moho Film Yong Film See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget ₩10,000,000,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $2,006,788 Opening weekend US & Canada $92,129 Oct 23, 2016 Gross worldwide $37,767,206 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 2 hours 25 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Dolby Atmos Dolby Surround 7.1 Aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 Related news Molly Sims Signs With UTA Oct 28Deadline Film + TV How Pauli Murray’s Trailblazing Advocacy Shaped the World We Know Today Oct 8Indiewire Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the streaming release date of Ah-ga-ssi (2016) in Mexico?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
