Personal Quote: (1997 - On his favorite films that he has done) I've always held Longtime Companion (1989) and Where the Day Takes You (1992) in a little higher regard than some of the more simply entertaining films I've done - they were films that had something to reveal to the world. Also, Living in Oblivion (1995) was a strange little achievement by a handful of people I really love.
