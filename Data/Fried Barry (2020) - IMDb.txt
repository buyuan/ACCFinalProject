Connections Featured in The Last Drive-In with Joe Bob Briggs: Fried Barry (2021) User reviews35 Review Top review Weird I wouldn't call this a good movie, the story isn't very good, but it's still an interesting watch and has some cool visuals. I definitely wouldn't recommend it as a buy but if you can stream it free, it's not bad if you want to watch something weird. helpful•5 8 phollyjunk May 12, 2021 Details Edit Release date August 25, 2020 (Mexico) Country of origin South Africa Official site Official Facebook Page Languages English Afrikaans Also known as Жареный Барри Filming locations Cape Town, South Africa Production companies The Department of Special Projects The Department of Special Projects Enigma Ace Films See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 39 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 2.39:1 Related news October 5th Genre Releases Include Escape Room: Tournament Of Champions (Blu-ray / DVD), Halloween I–V (4K / Blu-ray), Phantasm I & II (Double Feature Blu-ray) Oct 5DailyDead Wamg Giveaway: Win the Blu-ray of the New Shocker Fried Barry Sep 29WeAreMovieGeeks.com Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the English language plot outline for Fried Barry (2020)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
