My mistake was to sit through this Tedium! Crime Story Disappoints in Spite of Teaming up Such Accomplished Actors Dreyfuss and Sorvino. The Mood is Dark and Depressing in a Lifeless, Desperate Tone. Storyline is a Confused Mess, Script is Bad, Music Highly Annoying, Camera Work Quite Unsteady in this Poorly Directed Amateurish Effort. Do I recommend?
