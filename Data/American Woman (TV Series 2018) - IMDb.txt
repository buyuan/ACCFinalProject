The show is a fictionalized depiction of Kyle's upbringing, inspired by her mother but not an exact autobiographical reenactment of her life. For example, Kyle has two sisters whereas on the show, Bonnie only has two daughters, not three. Bonnie's friend on the show was named after Kathleen Mary Richards, although she is not based on her. The character Kathleen represents female friends that Kyle Richards' mother had who frequented her life. Connections Featured in WatchMojo: Top 10 Summer TV Shows Not on Your Radar (2018) User reviews45 Review Top review 5/10 More Like American Boredom I was really excited for this show when I first heard about it and saw the trailer. The premier was decent but I feel like it has fallen flat on its face, even after only two episodes. The premise is unique enough, and I usually always enjoy shows or films that tackle women's liberation, especially from an era before our own. But sadly, American Woman is just that- sad. The acting leaves much to be desired, the pace is too slow and despite its handful of semi charming moments, it quite frankly doesn't hold my interest. I will probably keep watching to see if it improves as it goes along but I am not optimistic. Perhaps if they gave Mena Suvari (whom I adore) more screen time I might feel differently, although she alone probably could not redeem the credibility of this hot mess. If the production team were a little league baseball team, I'd present them with a lame participation trophy and then call it a night. helpful•11 8 icanbeaghost Jun 15, 2018 Details Edit Release date June 7, 2018 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Американка Filming locations Los Angeles, California, USA Production companies John Wells Productions TV Land Warner Horizon Television See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 30 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news Ridley Scott Will Receive the Cinema Audio Society Filmmaker Award Nov 2Variety Film + TV Sienna Miller Gets "Bazaar" Oct 31SneakPeek Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was American Woman (2018) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
