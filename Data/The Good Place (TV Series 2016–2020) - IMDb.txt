Michael (Danson) is the architect who oversees the town--and this is the first one he has been in charge of creating. Eleanor (Bell) arrives at the Good Place and realizes they have her name right, but everything else is wrong. She isn't meant to be there at all. With the help of Chidi, her soul mate (Harper), Eleanor tries to right her wrongs, seeking to finally earn her spot in the Good Place. —carly lawless afterlifeheavenutopiaethicsneighborhood36 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Welcome to The Good Place. Everything is fine. (Season 1) Genres Comedy Drama Fantasy Romance Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia On January 4, 2019, a video appeared on The Good Place YouTube feed entitled "Janet's Void: What Actually Happens When * BING *". It consists of five hours of Janet standing around in her void, occasionally disappearing. You Tube commentators soon noticed that her disappearances were about 22 minutes long, the length of an episode. Quotes Michael: You humans take something wonderful and ruin it just a little bit so you can have more. Alternate versions Most of the episodes have extended versions; which are available to stream at the NBC website and Hulu, and included in the Blu-ray releases. Connections Featured in Late Night with Seth Meyers: Chelsea Clinton/Ted Danson/Bishop Briggs/Stanton Moore (2016) User reviews655 Review Top review 8/10 A feel good show with a stronger message underneath I love this show. It's a feel good comedy that's lighthearted and will make you laugh while still trying to get some good life lessons across. You also don't need to search to find the deeper meaning in the show, its made blatantly obvious, but its not heavy. Kristen Bell is quirky and lovable in this, and the rest of the cast is an odd blend of characters that just mix so well together. The acting and writing is phenomenal and the production is bright and cheerful and pleasant to watch. NBC is winning this season with new shows. I definitely recommend it. helpful•279 34 hfreexx Oct 27, 2016 FAQ2 What country is Chidi supposed to be from originally?
