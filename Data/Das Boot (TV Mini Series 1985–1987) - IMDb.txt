Connections Edited from Das Boot (1981) User reviews28 Review Top review Common Humanity Das Boot is my favorite war film. It shows war through the eyes of Germans. It is so realistic and intense that I live it every time I see it. It is one war film where I consider Germans to be the "good guys"! Their humanity and fight for survival touch me in such a way that I cannot help but be totally for them. It does indeed prove that beneath every uniform their lies a human being with hopes and dreams for the future. It makes me realize that war is terrible for everyone involved. It makes me realize that our common humanity is much more important than politics. We all should recognize this fact of life. God bless the people who made this film. They not only opened my mind but also my heart! So I'd like to say to them: Vielen Dank! helpful•70 8 Balberith Mar 15, 2000 Details Edit Release date February 24, 1985 (West Germany) Countries of origin West Germany France United Kingdom Italy Languages German French English Also known as Підводний човен Filming locations La Pallice, La Rochelle, Charente-Maritime, France Production companies Bavaria Film British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) RAI Radiotelevisione Italiana See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 4 hours 53 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Stereo Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
