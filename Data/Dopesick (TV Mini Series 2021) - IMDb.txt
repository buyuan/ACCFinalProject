Connections Featured in AniMat's Crazy Cartoon Cast: The Rat of All My Dreams (2020) User reviews70 Review Top review 9/10 Feeling No Pain I'm not going to lie...Dopesick is hard to watch. A disgustingly rich family who wants to get even more disgustingly rich preys on hardworking blue collar workers (and the doctors who treat them) with lies and deception over the pretense of alleviating pain to improve quality of life. A real life example of Big Pharma doing literally anything for their financial bottom line, no matter the cost to the unsuspecting public, by manipulating the facts to suit their twisted end game! helpful•31 7 QueenCatia Oct 16, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 13, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Ломка Filming locations Clifton Forge, Virginia, USA Production companies John Goldwyn Productions 20th Century Fox Television 20th Television See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 2 hours Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news Dopesick's Kaitlyn Dever Talks Betsy's Crushing Fate and That Phone Call Nov 17TVLine.com Dopesick Season 1 Episode 7 Recap: The Black Box Nov 16TVovermind.com Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Dopesick (2021) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
