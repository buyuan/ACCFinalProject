The scheming station head manager Cory Ellison sees in her the chance to push his career further. The show's other popular co-host Alex Levy, disgruntled by the fact that she has to take in a newbie, tries to use this new situation to make her own power move and turn Bradley into an ally. Meanwhile, Mitch refuses to accept defeat and tries to take everyone in the station who knew about his sexual abuse scandal but said nothing down with him. Other characters include Chip Black, the show's cynical top producer and program organizer, Hannah Shoenfeld, the station's employee and Mitch's emotionally gutted silent victim, Yanko Flores, a romantic and the Morning Show's most popular reporter, Claire Conway, a British junior employee of the station and Yanko's smitten secret girlfriend, and Fred, the station's sleazy chief executive who tried to help Mitch cover up the scandal. journalistforced sexsexual predatorfemale journalistoffice romance29 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines The news is only half the story. Genre Drama Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon both received a $2 million fee per episode, but it does not include fees for executive producing and points on the series' back-end, as both are serving as executive producers on the series. Apple has already ordered 20 episodes of the series, split into two seasons. Quotes Hannah Shoenfeld: We're The Morning Show. We can do anything. Connections Featured in Jimmy Kimmel Live!: Jennifer Aniston/Dave Matthews/Blanco Brown (2019) User reviews781 Review Top review 9/10 So much more than the sum of its parts I'd put off watching The Morning Show because I thought it would be a Sorkin-lite style Newsroom series set in a breakfast show and that felt like a tired format with nothing new to say. How utterly wrong I was. Yes it's got the big names. Yes it has clearly had a vast amount of money thrown at it, but that doesn't mean it isn't one of the most gripping tv series I've watched in years. The series builds and builds, the tension cranking up with each episode, literally at points, leaving me breathless. What I found particularly remarkable is that the #metoo movement is seen through so many different perspectives but cleverly the writers allow each perspective to live its own truth, whether or not that is a reliable truth or not, morally right or not, and in doing so it weaves this uncomfortable narrative that exactly reflects the rich and strange tapestry that is the real world. I thought that aspect of it was audacious. To not bring judgement and spoon feed an audience is a brave and risky thing to do. The performances are stellar, it's an ensemble cast with everyone bringing their A game. I devoured this first series in a couple of days and cannot wait for series 2. Can they replicate the clever and nuanced storytelling of this first series, I hope so. helpful•17 2 boophillips Aug 15, 2021 FAQ2 Is there going to be a 2nd season?
