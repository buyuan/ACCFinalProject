They parachuted behind enemy lines in the early hours of D-Day in support of the landings at Utah beach, participated in the liberation of Carentan and again parachuted into action during Operation Market Garden. They also liberated a concentration camp and were the first to enter Hitler's mountain retreat in Berchtesgaden. A fascinating tale of comradeship that is, in the end, a tale of ordinary men who did extraordinary things. —garykmcd military20th century1940sweaponnetherlands81 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines They depended on each other. And the world depended on them. Genres Action Drama History War Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Almost all the main actors were cast because of their close physical resemblance to the real-life soldiers they were portraying. Goofs When the 101st Airborne was sent into Belgium just before the Battle of the Bulge they were ordered to remove the Screaming Eagle patch from their uniforms, so the Germans would not know they were facing an elite division. It was only after the battle when they moved into Hagenau that they were able to wear the patches again. Quotes 2nd Lt. George Rice: Looks like you guys are going to be surrounded. Richard Winters: We're paratroopers, Lieutenant. We're supposed to be surrounded. Alternate versions The version of the series run on the History Channel includes edits for some (but not all) graphic violence and profanity. Connections Featured in The Making of 'Band of Brothers' (2001) Soundtracks Band Of Brothers (Suite One) (uncredited) Composed by Michael Kamen Performed by The London Metropolitan Orchestra User reviews926 Review Top review 10/10 This series is so unbelievably realistic, so authentic. There aren't much TV-series which have left such an impression on me as Band of Brothers did. From the moment I saw the first episodes, I knew I had to buy this on DVD. This series, telling you the story of Easy Company of the US Army Airbourne Paratrooper division is so unbelievably realistic, so authentic... There has been put so much effort in taking care of all the details that it makes you believe that you are right in the middle of all the action. This is an outstanding achievement. It's about ten hours long, but I wouldn't mind if it was a few hours longer. Each episode opens with interviews with several of the actual men from Easy Company, talking about some of the experiences that that episode deals with. When you buy the special edition DVD box (a metal case with 6 instead of 5 DVD's), you will find the complete interviews with these men on the extra DVD. These interviews certainly aren't to be missed! As you may have guessed, I'm one of the biggest fans of this series. I could go on for hours about it, but our time is limited and instead of reading this you better watch the series yourself. According to me, there is only one score appropriate for a masterpiece like this one and that is 10/10. Amazing!!!! helpful•371 40 philip_vanderveken Sep 17, 2004 FAQ59 How is the U.S. structured? I don't understand the difference between platoons, companies, etc. Is there a second season? Why is this not #1 on IMDb's list over the best movies? Its rating is far above "The Shawshank Redemption".
