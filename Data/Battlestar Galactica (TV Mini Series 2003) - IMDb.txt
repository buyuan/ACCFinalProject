In a sudden, devastating strike, the Cylons return and lay waste to the colonies, aided by human-looking Cylon variants and an unwitting fifth columnist. The attack forces Commander William Adama to call into action his museum-piece warship, the Battlestar Galactica, and soon its company of hotshot fighter pilots is blasting away at the invaders. But their best efforts can't prevent the colonies' obliteration. Fleeing the Cylon genocide, the Galactica leads a rag-tag fleet of survivors on a lonely quest to find humanity's fabled 13th colony -- a planet known as Earth. —ahmetkozan woman smokes a cigartime dilationwoman wears a uniformcylonsurvivor132 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Never create what you can't control. Genres Action Adventure Drama Sci-Fi Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Commander Adama's final speech to his crew (including his repeated use of the phrase "So say we all!" to rally them to action) was largely improvised by Edward James Olmos. Goofs When the Galactica is preparing to do its first FTL jump, the hangers are retracted into the ship. As the ship is jumping, however, the hangers are fully extended again. Quotes [his decommissioning speech] Adama: The Cylon War is long over, yet we must not forget the reasons why so many sacrificed so much in the cause of freedom. The cost of wearing the uniform can be high, but... [very long pause] Adama: sometimes it's too high. You know, when we fought the Cylons, we did it to save ourselves from extinction. But we never answered the question "Why?" Why are we as a people worth saving? We still commit murder because of greed and spite, jealousy, and we still visit all of our sins upon our children. We refuse to accept the responsibility for anything that we've done, like we did with the Cylons. We decided to play God, create life. And when that life turned against us, we comforted ourselves in the knowledge that it really wasn't our fault, not really. You cannot play God then wash your hands of the things that you've created. Sooner or later, the day comes when you can't hide from the things that you've done anymore. Crazy credits The stop-motion/cut-out animation R&D TV logo has Ronald D. Moore and David Eick taking turns to kill each other every week, with one partner making a proposal in gibberish and the other attacking him using items from a gorilla to a lance. Connections Featured in Atop the Fourth Wall: Countdown: Part 2 (2009) User reviews458 Review Top review 10/10 I hated The New Battle Star I had the grate pleasure of been born in the 1970's. 1974 to be exact. We had Star Trek on every day. What more could a young fella ask for in 1977, I remember catching the bus with my father to watch Star Wars. If I recall correctly the dude in the black mask gave me some bad dreams. Skip forward 3 years as father and son went to see the empire strike back. It was around this time at school where every kid was asking was Vader Luke's dad. It would fill up our every lunch time discussions until a kid said did you guys watch the show on Saturday morning. No we all said, so next weekend we all went round to Chrises house and had our minds blown away. There were epice space fights with robots. As a bunch of 7 years old kids we were hooked. We watched it on Saturday morning and played out our favourite scenes. In the play ground on Monday. We loved that show so much that serveral of us started whistling the theam song while playing the Apple //e game elite. ( one of the best challenging space trader games ever ). As kids tend to grow up so did we. We grew up on some pretty fantastic shows and would defend their honnor till death if need be. Skip forward to 2003. We were so excited to see our favourite show brought back from its deep dark hole where it was sitting for the best part of 24 years. We were so excited to see the mini series but we all hated it. It didn't live up to our expectations, yes we know that our expectations were outrageously set too high. So as a group we decided not to watch anymore episodes. Move on to 2013 at a boys night in the motel they just happened to be playing the 2003 mini series. We were all glued to the tube and spent the whole weekend binge watching. Being a bit older and wiser it was easier to accept the series as the excellent show it is and realise that as kids we only remember the good parts. I hope the boys and girls are playing in the play ground after watching bsg the same type of game we were as kids. Despite the initial reacton to the new series I have to admit this could be one of the best sci-fi shows ever. I would like to see a spin off series following another battlestar during one of the wars or maybe a tale of the 13 tribes. Either way give us more BSG please!!!!!!!! helpful•10 0 mike-991-958245 Jan 19, 2019 FAQ5 Is this a remake of the 1978 television show? What is a "Battlestar"? What are "Cylons"?
