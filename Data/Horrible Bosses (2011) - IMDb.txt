Dale hates his boss, Dr. Julia Harris, because she makes unwelcome sexual advances when he's about to get married. But Dale is on that pesky list of child-offenders so he can't quit. Kurt actually likes his job and his boss--well, up until his boss dies and the boss's coked-out, psychopathic son takes over. But who would be crazy enough to quit their jobs in such poor economic times? Instead, Nick, Dale, and Kurt drunkenly and hypothetically discuss how to kill their bosses, and before they know it, they've hired a murder consultant to help them pull off the three deeds. —napierslogs black comedyscantily clad femalewhite pantiesvoyeurblack panties113 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Is your boss a slave-driving psycho? Genres Comedy Crime Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for crude and sexual content, pervasive language and some drug material Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia To promote this film, Warner Brothers Pictures Canada set up a 12-foot voodoo doll resembling a corporate boss in downtown Montreal. People were given the chance to vent their office frustrations on the doll by stabbing and hitting it with large needles. They were also encouraged to share their best or worst boss story for the chance of winning passes to an advance screening of the film. Goofs Detectives would never question three murder suspects together. They would be interviewed individually to see if their stories are consistent. Quotes Detective Hagan: Do you want to explain why you were doing 61 in a 25 zone? One block from the victim's house. Just moments after he got shot dead. Nick Hendricks: I was drag-racing. I'm a drag-racer. Detective Samson: You were drag-racing. Nick Hendricks: [nods] Detective Samson: In a Prius. Nick Hendricks: I don't win a lot. Crazy credits Outtakes and bloopers at the beginning of the closing credits. Alternate versions The word "Fuck" has been muted on the Comedy Central airings.

Real Flat. I had high hopes for Horrible Bosses. It started out well. The first 15 minutes made it seem like it would be really good. The premise was alright and the first few minutes set up the rest of the movie well. Unfortunately, the joke writing was bad. There were a few funny lines, but they were interwoven into a tapestry of mediocrity. I'm pretty biased though because I don't like Charlie Day's shtick. He plays the exact same character as he does in Always Sunny, a really stupid guy who talks a mile a minute and if you listen carefully there's a few jokes in there. I don't enjoy that. I don't really like Jason Sudekis either. I find him bland and he plays an extremely dull character in this as well. You could take him out and the movie would still be mostly the same. Jason Bateman's character seems to be aware he's in a bad comedy. He doesn't really seem to like Sudekis or Day and treats all the wacky situations with a sort of slightly angry distaste. I watched Bridesmaids a few nights ago and enjoyed it way more than Horrible Bosses. That movie also had story line problems, but it had a lot of funny parts. That's all I want a comedy to do, make me laugh. Horrible Bosses didn't really do that for me, as the vast majority of its never-ending dialogue falls enormously flat. helpful•67 72 Old_Swampy Sep 25, 2011 FAQ2 What are the differences between the Theatrical Version and the Extended Version?
