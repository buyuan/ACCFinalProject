Detective Park Doo-Man and Detective Cho Yong-koo, two brutal and stupid local detectives without any technique, investigate the murder using brutality and torturing the suspects, without any practical result. The Detective Seo Tae-Yoon from Seoul comes to the country to help the investigations and is convinced that a serial-killer is killing the women. When a third woman is found dead in the same "modus-operandi", the detectives find leads of the assassin. —Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil neo noirpoliceserial killerbased on true story1980s94 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines 1986 in a small town...for two detectives, everything was new. Genres Crime Drama Mystery Thriller Certificate Not Rated Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia In order to make his character Detective Seo look properly worn-out by the stress of the case, actor Kim Sang-kyung deliberately limited his food intake and slept fewer hours. Goofs When Detective Seo Tae-Yoon's gun is tossed away from his hands by Park Hyeon-gyu, the gun is seen landing to the left of the train tracks from the camera's point of view. Moments later, when the detective returns to pick it up, the gun is seen lying on the train tracks itself. Quotes [last lines] Detective Park Doo-Man: Did you see his face? [Girl Nods] Detective Park Doo-Man: What did he look like? Schoolgirl: Well... kind of plain. Detective Park Doo-Man: In what way? Schoolgirl: Just... ordinary Alternate versions The British DVD by Optimum Releasing has 5 minutes cut omitting the whole part of the film between the release of the last suspect and Detective Seo Tae-Yoon shadowing him. Therefore important scenes for the development of the story are missing, such as when the detectives are informed about the possibility of a DNA analysis of sperm found on one of the victim's clothes and that the sample has to be sent abroad because the required equipment is not in Korea. Also missing is the sequence where Detective Cho Yong-koo loses his leg and a scene with Kwok Seol-yung asking Detective Park Doo-Man to quit the police. Connections Featured in Anasuya (2007) User reviews337 Review Top review 10/10 Left me in AWE! Being a movie buff and a director in the making, I watched this film (with English subtitles, Korean not being my mother tongue), I was completely blown away by this piece of cinematic excellence. There is not a single thing about this film that I can think of in a negative connotation. I wouldn't want to give away anything about this masterpiece. All I would like to say is that this is a film not to be missed. If I want any of my movies to be globally renowned one day, I hope it resembles "memories of murder" in any form whatsoever. This film simply belongs in the top 10 of the greatest movies ever made. 10/10. helpful•91 31 Kazombie Dec 9, 2005 FAQ4 Is this based on a real story?
