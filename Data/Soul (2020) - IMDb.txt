Joe Gardner is about to find his. Genres Animation Adventure Comedy Drama Family Fantasy Music Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG for thematic elements and some language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Animators used footage of several music performers, including jazz composer Jon Batiste, performing as reference for the film's musical sequences. By capturing MIDI data from the sessions, animators were able to retrace the exact key being played on the piano with each note and create the performances authentically. Goofs (at around 37 mins) When Joe gets into the cat soul they wonder what happened to its actual soul. It is then showed that the cat's soul is on its way to the beyond, implying the cat died. When Joe gets his body back the cat is seen alive and well (at around 1h 12 mins), which makes no sense since the cat is dead. However, cats have nine lives. Quotes Jerry: So what do you think you'll do? How are you gonna spend your life? Joe: I'm not sure. But I do know... I'm going to live every minute of it. Crazy credits There is a dedication in the closing credits: "Dedicated to all the mentors in our lives." Alternate versions The movie's DVD and Blu-Ray release excludes the Disney+ Original logo at the beginning. Connections Featured in AniMat's Crazy Cartoon Cast: Trolls: Infinity Strings (2019) Soundtracks Things Ain't What They Used to Be (Instrumental) Written by Mercer Ellington User reviews1.7K Review Top review 10/10 Soul might be Pixar's most grown up film yet. While I found myself thoroughly engrossed while watching this movie a funny thing happened around the half way point. I realized I hadn't laughed once. Sure I had smiled a few times at the low key humor but never was a joke thrown in my face that seemed like it was just thrown in there to make sure the film didn't lose the kiddos. Admittedly Pixar doesn't usually go out of its way to ensure kids laughing every second but this film REALLY doesn't have that on it's mind. This is a lovely story about a grown man discovering his true gifts in life and it left a big smile on my face. A very sweet and inventive film that will hopefully leave most of us adults with something to think about when the credits role. helpful•957 120 black-wolf-rise Dec 25, 2020 FAQ8 When will they release this film on DVD? Is Joe really the first person to ever reject being dead? What do the lost souls mean by "Make a trade", which they spookily repeat over and over again?
