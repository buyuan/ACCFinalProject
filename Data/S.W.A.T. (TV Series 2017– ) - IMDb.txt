Torn between loyalty to where he was raised and allegiance to his brothers in blue, Daniel "Hondo" Harrelson strives to bridge the divide between his two worlds and acclimate to his new duties as the legal guardian of a teenager. Hondo's elite unit includes David "Deacon" Kay, an experienced S.W.A.T. officer and dedicated family man who always puts the team first; Christina "Chris" Alonso, a skilled officer and the team's canine trainer; Dominique Luca, an expert driver who gets them in and out of high risk situations; Victor Tan, who started in the LAPD Hollywood Division and uses his confidential informants in the community to help the team; and Jim Street, the team's cocky newest member who is re-instated to S.W.A.T. after being fired for compromising the unit. Responsible for the management of all Metro Division S.W.A.T. units is Commander Robert Hicks, a senior LAPD official with the Special Operations Bureau. Following Captain Jessica Cortez's departure for the FBI, the Mayor assigns Lieutenant Piper Lynch to SWAT as a tactical consultant, where she challenges the team's field strategy, which raises questions about her loyalty. With Hondo leading the charge, these dedicated men and women bravely put themselves at risk to protect their community and save lives. —CBS swat teamspecial weapons and tactics unitbased on tv serieslos angeles californiacopaganda19 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines The elite of the elite Genres Action Adventure Crime Drama Thriller Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The Los Angeles Police Department (L.A.P.D.) created the first Special Weapons And Tactics (S.W.A.T.) unit.
