Personal Quote: When asked what it was like to watch his movies... "As most actors/actresses, I don't like to watch my own movies either and I never look at the daily's while filming. My favorite movies with me in them are Running Scared (2006) and Thank You for Smoking (2005). I love those two and totally got into watching those movies that I forgot I was in them".
