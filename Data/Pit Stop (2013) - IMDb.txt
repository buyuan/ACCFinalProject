On the other side of town, Ernesto evades life at home with his current live-in ex-boyfriend by spending much of his spare time visiting a different, comatose, ex-boyfriend, who was in a recent accident. Impervious to the monotony of their blue-collar world, they maintain an unwavering yearning for romance. The emotional isolation the two men have grown accustomed to is captured in a subtle, optimistic, poetic fashion while avoiding melodrama. The film premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival, and was also screened at several other film festivals in the US and Canada, including a variety of both traditional and LGBT themed fests. —Websurfer / edited by TrivWhiz gay lead charactergay interestex husband ex wife relationshipsmall towntexas40 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Drama Romance Certificate Not Rated Parents guide Did you know Edit Connections Featured in The 2014 Film Independent Spirit Awards (2014) Soundtracks The Sand Panther Medicine Show Written by Jeremy Steding Performed by Jeremy Steding User reviews32 Review Top review 9/10 A Fantastic Film about individuals that are gay, no stereotypes Small quiet film about a few gay men in a small town in Texas. Each of their stories, some totally unrelated, until Gabe and Ernesto meet. Excellent quiet plain talk movie. Real people problems and lives all at the same time, but overwhelming, a few stories that end in one. If you want 'young' gays from big cities, big gay communities, stereotypes, lots or any sex scenes = ACTION, clichés, hot handsome 'model's, then this is not a film for you. If you want real people out there in the small towns that live real lives in a different place, real REAL conversations, situations, relationships, etc., Not a soundtrack from beginning to end of House Beat "Gay" music, then you could consider trying this movie. The director, Yen Tan, should be a giveaway to a style of film. NOT Hollywood, Not gay films for the young and horny, but a film about real people, other people, etc. For this type or style of movie, this one is great! helpful•13 4 solarprestige May 8, 2015 Details Edit Release date January 21, 2013 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Official Facebook Official site Languages English Spanish Also known as 愛情進出站 Filming locations Austin, Texas, USA Production companies Vilcek Foundation Mile Marker Film See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 20 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 Related news Arrow’s November Lineup Includes Lake Of Dracula and The Wizard Of Gore Nov 5DailyDead Pit Stop Oct 7Trailers from Hell Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the English language plot outline for Pit Stop (2013)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
