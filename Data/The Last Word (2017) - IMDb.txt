Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Veteran British actress Millicent Martin enjoys a quick cameo as a "Margaret Dumont". This was surely slipped in as a sly tribute to the legendary character actress Margaret Dumont by the film's star, Shirley MacLaine, who'd appeared with her in What a Way to Go! (1964). Goofs At the end of the film, Harriet's gift to Anne is a pair of airline tickets to From LAX to Andalusia. Andalusia isn't a single city or airport. It's an autonomous region in southern Spain divided into eight provinces actually serviced by six different public airports, all of which can legally handle international flights. The Málaga Airport is the largest and busiest of these. Quotes Harriet: Please don't have a nice day. Have a day that matters. Have a day that's true. Have a day that's direct. Have a day that's honest. A nice day? Mm-mmm, you'll be miserable. Have a day that means something.

Have a day that matters... have a day that means something.' Stuart Ross Fink appears to be making his screen writing debut with this very successful film THE LAST WORD. Mark Pellington directs a well-selected cast to support this showcase for the many talents of 83-year-old Shirley MacLaine. Not only is the film a fine story well told: it also takes on the topic f ageism and the manner in which the elderly are viewed in our youth oriented society. Harriet (Shirley MacLaine) is a highly successful, retired businesswoman who wants to control everything around her until the bitter end. To make sure her life story is told her way, she pays off her local newspaper (one of her many recipients of her wealth) to have her obituary written in advance under her watchful eye. But Anne (Amanda Seyfried), the young journalist assigned to the task, refuses to follow the script and instead insists on finding out the true facts about Harriett's life, resulting in a life-altering friendship. We meet Harriet's estranged husband Edward (Philip Baker Hall), her equally estranged daughter Elizabeth (Anne Heche), a 'mind-of-her-own' foster child Brenda (AnnJewel Lee Dixon) whom Harriet takes under her wing and learns as much from the child as she attempts to influence her, and her final 'boss' – radio disc jockey Robin Sands (Thomas Sadowski) - who places Harriet in the early morning radio slot as a disc jockey par excellence. From each encounter Anne arranges for Harriet (discovering that no one has anything positive to say about Harriet's self absorbed life history) we watch Harriet come to life as she has never lived it. MacLaine offers a bravura performance deserving of awards. The entire cast is excellent. This is a very fine film in this time of prejudice against ageism. helpful•9 6 gradyharp Jul 9, 2017 Details Edit Release date March 3, 2017 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Official Site Official site (Japan) Language English Also known as Son Kelime Filming locations Pasadena, California, USA Production companies Franklin Street Myriad Pictures Parkside Pictures See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross US & Canada $1,783,421 Opening weekend US & Canada $31,630 Mar 5, 2017 Gross worldwide $2,982,004 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 48 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 Related news Tony Awards Review: Broadway Teaches TV A Lesson With Livestream-Broadcast Hybrid Sep 27Deadline Film + TV Tonys Review: Broadway’s Back (Finally!)
