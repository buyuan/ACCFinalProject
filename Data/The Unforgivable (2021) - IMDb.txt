Genre Drama Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for language and violence Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia This movie was originally announced in 2010. Producer Graham King very much wanted Angelina Jolie to play Ruth Slater, and hired Christopher McQuarrie to write a script tailored specifically for her. She never officially signed on, and over the next few years the movie went through various other writers and directors, including McQuarrie and Scott Frank, before stalling. It went back into development in 2019.
