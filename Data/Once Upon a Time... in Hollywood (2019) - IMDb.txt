Genres Comedy Drama Certificate (Banned) Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The producers had some initial difficulties convincing Hollywood Boulevard vendors to allow their premises to be fitted with period facades to better reflect the 1960s. However, after the production wrapped that section of the shoot, most of these same people asked if they could leave the facades in place, since they now much more preferred that period 'look.' Goofs When Sharon Tate was talking to the girl at the box office of the movie theater in Westwood, you can see the Starbucks sign for half the scene before it was covered up. Starbucks was founded in 1971. Quotes Cliff Booth: Oh, I know you. I know all three of you! Yeah, Spahn Ranch! Spahn Ranch, yeah! Woo! [turns to Katie] Cliff Booth: I don't know your name, but I remember that hair. [turns to Sadie] Cliff Booth: And you, I remember your white little face. [turns to Tex] Cliff Booth: And you were on a horsey! Yeah... you are? Tex: I'm the Devil. And I'm here to do the Devil's business. Cliff Booth: ...Nah, it was dumber than that. Something like Rex. Sadie: God, shoot him, Tex! Cliff Booth: Tex! Crazy credits Like Django Unchained (2012), the film opens with the late 1960's Columbia Pictures logo. Alternate versions In the teaser trailer and the next 2 theatrical trailers some shots from deleted scenes are shown. Cliff Booth see Charles Manson walking away from Sharon Tate's house. Both exchange looks. Charlie initially greets Cliff, later Charlie grunts at him. Sharon Tate dancing in a black dress in a moving stage. Mr. Schwarz salutes the projectionist before entering the projection room. Sharon Tate swimming in her pool.

It took Quentin Tarantino a lifetime of living, 5 years to write and a 2 hours 41 minutes watch. This is a love letter to a film industry that is no longer recognisable. Hippies, short skirts, westerns..... all have disappeared from our movie world. But worry not, Quentin Tarantino is here to remind us of old school film making from a once beloved industry which has been described as being on life support. The performances are flawless. I was apprehensive about how the events of August 8, 1969 would be handled. But that is handled tastefully and respectfully, yet with the classic Tarantino flair. Will be quite a bit for those under 40 who have no recollection of this Hollywood. Some will categorise this as an over indulgent nostalgia trip for movie geeks. And they are likely to be correct. But for those of us who complain that Hollywood is reduced to remakes and comic book films, QT delivers a unique and creative viewing experience. helpful•268 163 dhunjiwadia Feb 7, 2020 FAQ17 Why is Samuel L. Jackson not in this movie? Is this a true story? Did Cliff Booth really kill his wife?
