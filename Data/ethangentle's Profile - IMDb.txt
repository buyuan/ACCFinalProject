What is the greatest film ever? This is a question that has been asked by multiple generations of critics and fans alike. Is it Casablanca or Citizen Kane? What about the Godfather? What about movies like Gone With the Wind or The Wizard of Oz? Well, the debate has ended because Michael Scott's Threat Level Midnight is the undisputed GOAT of cinema. It's a better spy thriller than James Bond, a more compelling love story than Casablanca with a better cast than The Godfather. From the inspiring scene with Cherokee Jack to Goldenface explaining why he is gold this movie has heart. It also has feel-good moments like Michael Scarn doing his signature dance and regaining his confidence. And the action O BOY the action, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time I gasped at the President's shocking double-cross and when Goldenface blew the head of the animal rapist I was shocked and appalled. It made me laugh, it made me cry but most importantly it left me inspired. I can't wait to see what the amazing Michael Scott does next. You'll never get tired of watching this film you could do it all day long (that's what she said) See more▼See less▲ Alice in Wonderland (1951) Impressed! 11 February 2021 The characters are just so delightful and interesting the animation is nice and i overall just enjoyed the movie See more▼See less▲ Dumbo (1941) It sucks im sorry it just sucks 22 January 2021 - 0 out of 3 users found this review helpful. Despite being one of the most popular classic animated Disney movies Dumbo might indeed be the worst it's boring the story makes no sense at characters are nothing I'm sorry it's just not good the only redeeming quality about this is is that is that is that Mel Blanc voiced Dumbo and Mel Blanc is the best but don't waste your time watching this movie I don't know why It has such a high rating go watch pinnochio instead.

This movie is actually pretty good things first I'm going to list the things I liked about it it was suspenseful it was entertaining and was action-filled the things I didn't like about it was that it was pretty unrealistic and the acting was pretty mediocre and the dialogue was cheesy so that's why I'm only giving it 9 or 10 instead of 10 out of 10 even if you don't agree with the daily wires political views you should give this movie a watch you'll enjoy it.
