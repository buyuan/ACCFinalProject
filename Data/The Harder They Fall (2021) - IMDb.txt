Those riding with him in this assured, righteously new school Western include his former love Stagecoach Mary, his right and left hand men hot-tempered Bill Pickett and fast drawing Jim Beckwourth and a surprising adversary-turned-ally. Rufus Buck has his own fearsome crew, including "Treacherous" Trudy Smith and Cherokee Bill, and they are not a group that knows how to lose. revengeprisonwild westparentscowboy53 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines New Blood in the Old West Genres Action Drama Western Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for strong violence and language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Nat Love, Mary Fields, Rufus Buck, Cherokee Bill, Bill Pickett, Jim Beckworth and Bass Reeves are all real historical figures of the old west. Goofs After Rufus is released from his cell on the train, he orders the gang to kill all the soldiers in the train car, but one. He then walks towards the exit while men and shell casings fall all around him. All of the weapons fired in the train car are revolvers. They do not eject casings automatically when fired. Some of the weapons appeared to be cap & ball pistols, which have no casings at all. Quotes Father Esparza: Is it over? Nat Love: This is a wanted man. Turn his body in and you will get $5,000 for your church Father Esparza: Why aren't you taking him yourself?
