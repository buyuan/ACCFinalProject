Two women. Luck has nothing to do with it. Genres Drama Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for strong sexuality and language Parents guide Did you know Edit Quotes Alan Clay: Why don't you slip out of that wet raincoat and into a dry martini? Connections Followed by Body Chemistry 4: Full Exposure (1995) Soundtracks Point of Seduction Written and Performed by Becky LeBeau and Steven Weinberg Published by Bunny Penguin Overdubs (BMI) User reviews6 Review Top review YOU'RE A VERY UNUSUAL GIRL Another formulaic Stevens project. Shari Shattuck sizzles her way through this as the sex therapist who has a thing with Stevens, who is married to Morgan Fairchild.
