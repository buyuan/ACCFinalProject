Personal Quote: I still hear things like, "Gabrielle, you gave the best read! If we decide to go black, you're at the top of the list". I've actually been told, "Gabrielle, you're absolutely perfect for the role, but the role is a girl who's most popular in school". I've been to the point where I brought in my yearbook. "See how popular I was? It really can happen". See more » Trivia: Has a daughter: Kaavia James Union Wade (b. November 7, 2018) with husband, Dwyane Wade.
