Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Animation Short Family Certificate TV-PG Parents guide User reviews2 Review Top review 6/10 A walk back down memory lane. I'm 62 now. I remember watching the original series as a kid. I liked watching this review, along with the memories it brought back. It amuses me seeing today's generations keeping it going. It also tickles me seeing cosplay portrayals of Velma as a sexy chick! helpful•2 0 herohire-04931 Oct 30, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 29, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Filming locations USA Production companies Abominable Pictures Warner Bros.
