SUMALATHA is OK and AARTHI is good. especially VENKATESH acting in comedy scenes he behaved like a perfect village guy(VENKY) and his transformation in sentiment scenes were awesome and BREMMI performance in water world of-course inspired from Mr.bean but well suited for our nativity. Thank you 3VIKRAM and VENKATESH for such a great comedy and family entertainer. helpful•2 1 vardhan-mukunda Jan 30, 2014 Details Edit Release date September 6, 2001 (India) Country of origin India Language Telugu Also known as Я тебе нравлюсь!
