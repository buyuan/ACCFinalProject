Now, to thwart megalomaniac Piccolo's plans for world domination, Son Goku, along with a handful of brave defenders, must gather all seven mystical Dragon Balls before the next solar eclipse.

Genres Action Adventure Fantasy Sci-Fi Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG for intense sequences of action/violence and brief mild language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia "Dragon Ball" creator Akira Toriyama was initially supportive of the announcement of a live action adaptation and asked fans to treat the film as a different interpretation of his work, but after watching the film he was so horrified at this adaptation of his work that he decided to revive the series with the animated film Dragon Ball Z: Doragon bôru Z - Kami to Kami (2013). He later revealed that he wasn't allowed to have any creative input on the film and all of his suggestions were rejected. Goofs Roshi could leap out of the hole whenever he wanted, but wastes precious hours in the hole telling a story when time was running short to find the Dragonballs. Quotes Goku: [after Bulma's briefcase turns into a motorcycle] Cool! Crazy credits SPOILER: There is a scene in the closing credits: Piccolo is revealed to have survived, and is in the care of the woman he spared in his first scene.

User reviews610 Review Top review 3/10 This movie had potential . The Director never had any. I saw the movie with not too much expectations.. I am one of the skeptics but for a moment there i kept a certain positivism toward the movie. The movie Is an embarrassment to the manga , the anime , the fans and above all to Akira Toriyama. When I think that the budget for that movie was of 100 Million ..i'm confused of the result. Special effects are OK they're not AMAZING they're just OK .. Acting seems out of place at so many parts .. Parts that are supposed to be taken out are not. you can not deny how bad the script was .. I mean Potentially Changing the original story that much i was OK with it because DB-Franchise is very airy so you can revamp characters and situations. However The way the story was presented SUCKED BIG TIME ..Its Amazing Cheeziness for 2009 .. But then again thats James Wong for you . I'm not really against the actors and their fitting ..they could've fit if there was a better directing . WE DO NOT WANT PART II TO BE RUINED BY WONG !! MICHAEL BAY/BRYAN SINGER ALL THE WAY!!!!!! helpful•177 86 xploratio Mar 19, 2009 FAQ9 Is "Dragonball Evolution" based on a book? What is the history of the making of this movie?
