User reviews4 Review Top review 4/10 Not so deceptive I've been a fan of Dina meyer since the 90s. Since i first saw her in dragonheart and starship troopers, i was a huge fan. As usual though, i really didn't understand how much she has really been in. At this point i'm playing catch up. DECEPTION. This one i'm not surprised it slipped through the cracks and escaped my sight. A "TV" movie released in 2004, it follows Erin, (played by Dina Meyer) who is a struggling actress working for a detective agency, seducing married men and letting their wives catch them. Sounds fun and dangerous. I did enjoy this film to a point. I always try to enjoy anything Dina is in. Hell i liked Birds of Prey. Dina gives her best in her roles and this is no different. Of course the story is like 90% predictable. SO meh for story. The acting wasn't good but wasn't terrible either. It almost seemed like enhanced soap opera type. The cinematography and editing was choppy in alot of places. It honestly feels like one of those projects that is mostly done to make some money and i can respect that. To wrap this quick review up, i didn't expect much from this film and i got what i expected. Not good and not bad. One of those low budget tv movies you can watch while you are bored once or twice but nothing to really keep you coming back. I give Deception a 4/10. PS this doesn't change my view on Miss. Meyer. Dina, you're awesome, talented and gorgeous. :-) helpful•1 0 eclay-08172 Aug 15, 2019 Details Edit Release date 2003 (United States) Countries of origin Canada United States Official sites Hearst Entertainment official site Language English Also known as Decepción Filming locations Montréal, Québec, Canada Production companies Incendo Productions Duck Decoy Production Inc.
