Personal Quote: Television is fast and loose. You have two or three takes to get your part right, and if you have a problem, well by the time you figure it out, everyone's moved on to the next scene. It's good training, keeps you on your toes. Trivia: After securing Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern for Home Alone (1990), Chris Columbus felt confident enough to cast actors who were his heroes growing up like Catherine O'Hara after seeing her work on Second City TV (1976), as well as Heard, and then Tim Curry and Rob Schneider on Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992) because they were all open to the films.
