When Nora gets engaged to British Captain John Quin (Leonard Rossiter), Barry challenges him to a duel of pistols. He wins and escapes to Dublin, but is robbed on the road. Without an alternative, Barry joins the British Army to fight in the Seven Years War. He deserts and is forced to join the Prussian Army, where he saves the life of his Captain and becomes his protégé and spy of Irish gambler Chevalier de Balibari (Patrick Magee). He helps Chevalier and becomes his associate until he decides to marry the wealthy Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson). They move to England and Barry, in his obsession of nobility, dissipates her fortune and makes a dangerous and revengeful enemy. —Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil gamblerstepfather stepson conflictvoice over narrationsocial climbercard playing180 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines At long last Redmond Barry became a gentleman -- and that was his tragedy. Genres Adventure Drama History War Certificate PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Many of the shots were composed and filmed in order to evoke certain eighteenth-century paintings, especially those by Thomas Gainsborough. Goofs The narrator states, early on, "About this time, the United Kingdom was in a state of great excitement". The United Kingdom came into being in 1801, when it merged with the Kingdom of Ireland, before which it was known merely as the Kingdom of Great Britain.

The film portrays an unusual young Irish man, Redmond Barry, and his endeavours as he is forced to leave his home and tries to make good his life elsewhere. His life away from home starts out as a career in the British Army; only to evolve in surprising ways and lead to as different places as a position of trust within the Prussian Army and later a title of nobility, gained by what our time can only measure as rather disgraceful means. Some consider Barry Lyndon a slow and tedious film  and it is in deed past three hours in length, but this is because of the artistic flow of a film that strays not only to tell a tale about a man who is by no means neither hero nor villain, but also a film which is in no hurry and takes the time for every detail to sink into the mind and heart of the viewer. Some of the scenic images in "Barry Lyndon" are in themselves pieces of art, rendered with a passion for the landscapes and the man-made structures within them. The myth that all scenes were recorded using no artificial lighting no doubt stems from the very realistic lights during indoor takes, and some of them truly did not feature artificial light. This is but one of the many details that so easily conveys a sense of a realistic portray of the era; the 18th century and the time after the seven-year war in the later half of the century. The impressive atmosphere and the wonderfully picturesque scenarios along with the fact that the entire plot moves at a calm pace makes this film a very pleasant experience. "Barry Lyndon is", amidst Kubricks' many masterpieces, a film so easily dismissed due to length and the fact that it is overshadowed by others, but I deeply recommend this film to anyone who would like to see a film both for the plot line, the story and the pure enjoyment of the images presented. Stanley Kubrick made many great films  and this one is most definitely one of them! KimotoCat helpful•429 60 KimotoCat Jan 24, 2005 FAQ6 Why do the gamblers wore heavy makeup?
