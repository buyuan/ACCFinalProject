Genres Comedy Drama Parents guide Did you know Edit Soundtracks Castle In The Snow Performed by Tristan Casara (as The Avener) & Kadebostan By Amina Cadelli, Kadebostany User reviews10 Review Top review 8/10 Excellent multi-themed work A young woman coming of age. Finding one's direction in life. A man who has given up on life. A couple trying to preserve theirs. This is a film about relationships, and while considerably predictable is still well-done. From directing to camera work, sound and acting, everything is neatly packaged. It is a fairly basic story but enjoyable to watch. If one does not go in expecting Oscar-winning material and instead simply wishes for a good story, this will work. It is not perfect, but few films are. It achieves what it set out to achieve. helpful•0 0 Snootz Jun 27, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 7, 2015 (France) Country of origin France Official site Mandarin Films (France) Language French Also known as The Student and Mister Henri Filming locations Pantin, Seine-Saint-Denis, France Production companies Mandarin Films StudioCanal France 2 Cinéma See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget €5,831,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $761 Opening weekend US & Canada $486 Aug 21, 2016 Gross worldwide $5,411,932 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 38 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was L'étudiante et Monsieur Henri (2015) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
