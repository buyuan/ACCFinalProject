Ben Tennyson, in the form of Heatblast, confronts him. After a short battle, Ben seemingly obliterates the villain. Max Tennyson identifies him as Eon, an alien the Plumbers captured almost two centuries ago. When he arrived, he was half dead and brought a device with him called the Hands of Armageddon, which would open a time rift to the alien's home dimension and unleash his race upon Earth if activated. They travel to the containment facility where Eon is supposed to be kept, only to find it empty and his guardian aged to near-death. —Anthony Pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com} cartoon networknon comic book superheropsychotronic filmbased on cartoonlive action adaptation38 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Genres Action Adventure Family Sci-Fi Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia This movie marks the live-action debut of the characters from Ben 10 (2005).

Connections Featured in Troldspejlet: Episode #41.12 (2009) Soundtracks Ben Ten Theme Written by Andy Sturmer Performed by Jimmy Coup User reviews48 Review Top review 5/10 A fun disaster Obviously the film is awful since it is essentially a TV-movie. The cgi in this film is watchable, but what is not watchable is everything else in Alex Winter's cartoon network flick. The acting of the main protagonists of Ben 10 and Gwen must put up with awful dialogue, and not helping by giving that dialogue an awful delivery. The best thing about this film is it's overall charm. Your child will love it since they are seeing their heroes come to life. Adults will either hate it or just find it very boring as nothing happens for a long time in this film, but children who grew up on the original Ben 10 series will truly consider this disaster flick; a masterpiece. helpful•0 0 dp-17275 Feb 26, 2019 FAQ2 What Two Songs Do They Play In The "Behind The Scenes" Trailer?
