Formerly named The Love of Acting overtime it evolved into what it is today. The current program is two shows in one. One part is a weekly 30-minute topical program where experts are interviewed about an issue we are all grappling with. It is non-biased, fact-based, and meant to be a reliable source of information to enhance the user's understanding of the topic. The other part is Let's Dive In Journeys which is 30-minute conversations with people of consequence from all walks of life about the path they've chosen, the moments that changed everything, the good/bad/ugly of being them, and their lessons learned. We strive to help our audience become better through the experience of those who have accomplished a great deal. The show is a TV series that is also available as a podcast. interviewnon fiction Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Real People, Real Stories, Real Answers Genre Talk-Show Parents guide Add content advisory User reviews Be the first to review Details Edit Release date May 20, 2020 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site show site Language English Production company Amiveris See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour Color Color Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
