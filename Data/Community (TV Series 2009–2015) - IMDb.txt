Genre Comedy Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The show was based on series creator Dan Harmon's life at a community college, attempting to reconcile with his girlfriend in Spanish courses. He has also stated the characters are loosely based on the people with whom he hung around, and has nothing to do with his film and television career. Goofs Jeff is said to be attending Greendale for four years in order to attain his Bachelor's Degree. While the majority of Community Colleges only offer 2 year AA degrees, currently 17 states (including Colorado) allow Community Colleges to offer 4 year Bachelor's Degrees.

As a European, I am not really a big fan of typical US comedy. Yeah I can laugh at some scenes of friends, Seinfeld or any other main network sitcom, but they never make want to rewind and watch a joke/situation again. I only had that with some moments of Scrubs and well.... Community! First of all thank god for the absence of the laugh tape. I hate that old figment of the 60's etc. If something is funny, it's funny. Not because other people are laughing on tape. Community has this really quirky well thought sense of humor where every aspect is really worked out. Offcourse there is some typecasting going on like the oh-no-you-didn't African-American woman but Yvette someway makes that type more than a type. I could give a review of every cast member but all I have to say is: the ones casted as a typical egocentric bastard, pretty girl or anything else are bringing more than just that. I have to say that Danny Pudi, Chevy Chase and Donald Glover are the absolute funniest written and played characters/types on this show but I have to say: none of the cast hasn't NOT entertained me. The type of humor really reminds me of scrubs and British humor with more interest to the unexpected. than to the typical expected. Not "just random" humor, but just something else then the thing you've would expect. Please do not cancel this show soon. It is one of the shows I really look forward to each week. helpful•396 67 cerror Oct 2, 2009 FAQ10 What song played in a certain episode? Is Greendale Community College a real school?
