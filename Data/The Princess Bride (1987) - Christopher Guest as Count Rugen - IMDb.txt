You killed my father. Prepare to die. [Inigo advances on Rugen, but stumbles into the table with sudden pain. Rugen attacks, but Inigo parries and rises to his feet again] Inigo Montoya : Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die. [Rugen attacks again, Inigo parries more fiercely, gaining strength] Inigo Montoya : Hello! My name is Inigo Montoya! You killed my father! Prepare to die! Count Rugen : Stop saying that! [Rugen attacks, twice. Inigo avoids and wounds Rugen in both shoulders, the same spots where he wounded Inigo. Inigo attacks, bellowing:] Inigo Montoya : HELLO! MY NAME IS INIGO MONTOYA! YOU KILLED MY FATHER! PREPARE TO DIE! [Inigo corners Count Rugen, knocks his sword aside, and slashes his cheek, giving him a scar just like Inigo's] Inigo Montoya : Offer me money. Count Rugen : Yes! Inigo Montoya : Power, too, promise me that. [He slashes his other cheek] Count Rugen : All that I have and more. Please... Inigo Montoya : Offer me anything I ask for. Count Rugen : Anything you want... [Rugen knocks Inigo's sword aside and lunges. But Inigo traps his arm and aims his sword at Rugen's stomach] Inigo Montoya : I want my father back, you son of a bitch! [He runs Count Rugen through and shoves him back against the table. Rugen falls to the floor, dead] Inigo Montoya : Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die. Count Rugen : Stop saying that! Count Rugen : Your princess is quite a winning creature. A trifle simple, perhaps. Her appeal is undeniable. Prince Humperdinck : I know, the people are quite taken with her. It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, I thought that was clever. But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will truly be outraged - they'll demand we go to war. Count Rugen : [snickers, then examines a huge tree] Now where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find... [he finds it and the tree opens to reveal a hidden passage] Count Rugen : Ah. Are you coming down into the pit? Wesley's got his strength back. I'm starting him on the machine tonight. Prince Humperdinck : [sincerely] Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work, but I've got my country's 500th anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, my wife to murder and Guilder to frame for it; I'm swamped. Count Rugen : Get some rest. If you haven't got your health, then you haven't got anything. Count Rugen : You must be that little Spanish brat I taught a lesson to all those years ago. You've been chasing me your whole life only to fail now? I think that's about the worst thing I've ever heard. [pause] Count Rugen : How marvelous. Count Rugen : Beautiful isn't it? It took me half a lifetime to invent it. I'm sure you've discovered my deep and abiding interest in pain. Presently I'm writing the definitive work on the subject, so I want you to be totally honest with me on how the machine makes you feel. This being our first try, I'll use the lowest setting. Count Rugen : As you know, the concept of the suction pump is centuries old. Really that's all this is except that instead of sucking water, I'm sucking life. I've just sucked one year of your life away. I might one day go as high as five, but I really don't know what that would do to you. So, let's just start with what we have. What did this do to you? Tell me. And remember, this is for posterity so be honest. How do you feel? Man in Black : [issues a whimpering moan] Count Rugen : Interesting. Prince Humperdinck : You truly love each other? Then you might have been truly happy! No couple in a century has that chance, no matter what the storybooks say. And so I think no man in a century will suffer as greatly as you will [Throws the lever on the Machine up to the highest setting] Count Rugen : Not to Fifty! Westley : [Writhes and howls] Inigo Montoya : Fezzik, do you hear that? That is the sound of ultimate suffering. My heart made that sound when Count Rugen killed my father. The Man in Black makes it now. Fezzik : The Man in Black? Inigo Montoya : His true love is marry Prince Humperdinck tonight, so who else has cause for ultimate suffering? Count Rugen : You've got an overdeveloped sense of vengeance. It's going to get you into trouble one of these days. Buttercup : I thought you were dead once and it almost killed me. I could not bear it if you died again, not when I could save you. [Humperdink sweeps her away on his Horse] Count Rugen : Come, Sir, we must get you to your Ship. Westley : We are men of Action, Lies do not become us. Count Rugen : Well spoken, Sir... What is it, what's wrong? Westley : You have six fingers on your right hand! Someone was looking for you [knocked unconscious] Westley : . Count Rugen : Kill the giant and the dark one, leave the third for questioning.
