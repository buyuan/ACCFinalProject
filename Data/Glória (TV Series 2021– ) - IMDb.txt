At the center of this story is João Vidal, a young man from a family with connections in the Portuguese Fascist Regime, who gets recruited by the KGB after becoming politicized in the Colonial War. João will find himself involved in the intricate webs of the spy game, and ultimately understand that whatever side he is on, the world, particularly the one of espionage, is never black and white. portuguese language netflix original programming1960scold warsmall townpolitical20 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Where the World Goes to Hide Genres Drama History Thriller Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia Based on true events of Portugal history during Cold War. User reviews38 Review Top review 10/10 I only don't understand these ratings... 10/10 to make up for the crazy negative ratings there are from some Portuguese people! We can see there's a big production going on in these series something greater than any other project for the portuguese tv, the selection of actors is not the best but it's not the worse neither, these crazy associations that people make with "Soap Operas" it's only for a reason... Hearing and seeing portuguese actors acting in anything besides "soap operas" is weird and people are not used to it! The production is amazing and there are so many shots and techniques that I've never seen in any portuguese drama so it's a positive thing over there... In terms of the story itself...Well... It's interesting and that's pretty much it! Still worth it though! Ignore the negative reviews... Most of the users didn't have time to see the full series... The series is worth it... So go watch it! helpful•41 11 ricardormsoares Nov 5, 2021 Details Edit Release date November 5, 2021 (Portugal) Country of origin Portugal Official site Netflix Site Languages Portuguese English Also known as Ґлорія Filming locations Glória do Ribatejo, Santarém, Portugal Production companies RTP 2 Radiotelevisão Portuguesa (RTP) SP Televisão See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 40 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news The Shrink Next Door Review: Therapy Turns Toxic in Apple's Creepy Dramedy Nov 9TVLine.com New on Netflix: November 2021 Releases Nov 1Den of Geek Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Japanese language plot outline for Glória (2021)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
