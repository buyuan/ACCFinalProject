As Claudius narrates his life, we witness Augustus' attempts to find an heir, often foiled by his wife Livia who wants her son Tiberius to become emperor. We also see the conspiracy of Sejanus, the infamous reign of Caligula, and Claudius' own troubled period of rule. —Erika Grams <erika@email.unc.edu> 1st centuryroman emperorroman empirerise to powerpolitical intrigue50 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Let all the poisons that lurk in the mud hatch out.

Connections Featured in The 30th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards (1978) User reviews124 Review Top review The standard by which all TV should be judged The best miniseries ever made! Smart and sexy, with characters that live and breathe. Just some of the most marvelous characters include Brian Blessed as the benevolent Augustus, George Baker as the wounded Tiberius, and Siân Phillips as Livia. Includes one of John Hurt's finest performances, and I'd go into Derek Jacobi as Claudius, but they say I have to keep it below 1,000 words. The Canadian channel Bravo runs it occasionally, or try renting it from Blockbuster, but I recommend shelling out for the entire collection on video! helpful•57 3 AlabamaWorley1971 May 22, 2001 FAQ2 Why does the series feel like a stage play?
