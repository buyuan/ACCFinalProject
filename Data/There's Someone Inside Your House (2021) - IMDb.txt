User reviews208 Review Top review 3/10 Wait.... Stop.. who is reviewing this This movie is not good. Bad acting. And stereotypical casting roles. It's just flat out not good. I looked at the other reviewers history, all matching reviews. Shows you fake reviewers are already here and so nervous about their terrible movie they are trying to pump the ratings. This is just flat out below average filmmaking. Don't waste your time like I did. Just skip it. helpful•46 7 phelectric Oct 6, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 6, 2021 (Canada) Countries of origin Canada United States Official site Official Netflix Language English Also known as Có Ai Đó Trong Ngôi Nhà Filming locations Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada Production companies Netflix Atomic Monster 21 Laps Entertainment See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 36 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 2.39:1 Related news ‘There’s Someone Inside Your House’ Star Sydney Park on Reshooting the Ending During a Pandemic Nov 1The Hollywood Reporter - Film + TV 20th/Hulu Conjure ‘The Boogeyman’ From Stephen King Short; Rob Savage Directs & 21 Laps Produces Nov 1Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What was the official certification given to There's Someone Inside Your House (2021) in France?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
