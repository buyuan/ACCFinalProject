Connections Featured in WatchMojo: Top 10 TV Shows That Exceeded Expectations (2020) User reviews195 Review Top review 10/10 a smarter trailer park boys Asa small town Ontarian, this rang so true it made me wonder if it would translate outside of my world of inside jokes - i even guessed the town it was based on (Listowel) just by watching the season. dialog is Tarantino sharp and fast, the catch phrases fly by almost too fast to catch ( eyes on your own work there super chief) and if this series was on a VHS tape, I would wear it out. If this show does not garner awards for comedic writing, i will be shocked - simply the best thing i have seen in some time I signed up to the Canadian crave TV service solely for this offering and it is well worth it - i am surprised by the lack of buzz about this show in the media to be honest. I do not know if it is because this is not based on a reserve, or an urban coffee shop, or if the humor simply goes over most critic's heads helpful•122 26 dblackman-83420 Mar 1, 2016 Details Edit Release date February 7, 2016 (Canada) Country of origin Canada Official sites Hulu Letterkenny Problems Facebook Page Language English Also known as Леттеркенні Filming locations Sudbury, Ontario, Canada Production company New Metric Media See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 30 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news Rutherford Falls Co-Creator Sierra Teller Ornelas Shares Her Favorite Indigenous Artists Nov 16E!
