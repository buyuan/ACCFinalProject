He's Dexter Morgan, everyone's favorite serial killer. As a Miami forensics expert, he spends his days solving crimes, and nights committing them. But Dexter lives by a strict code of honor that is both his saving grace and lifelong burden. Torn between his deadly compulsion and his desire for true happiness, Dexter is a man in profound conflict with the world and himself. Golden Globe winner Michael C.

Over the years my eyes adjusted, until the dark became my world and I could see. Connections Featured in The 64th Annual Golden Globe Awards 2007 (2007) Soundtracks Main Theme Written by Rolfe Kent Performed by Rolfe Kent User reviews908 Review Top review 10/10 Wow Absolutely brilliant. True to Jeff Lindsay's books. The visual contrast between the darkness of Dexter's secret life and and the gloss of Miami adds an almost surreal quality. Character development is right on the money, bringing out the background slowly so one can see the development of Dexter's sociopath personality and his confusion of human behavior compared to his own. Dexter is an actor in his own life; his relationships between co-workers and his personal life are well shown in the video media. The fact that he is a blood splatter expert This is a dark work, but set in the bizarre world of life in Miami is almost believable. Developers of this series should also look to Andrew Vachss's books. helpful•590 104 jlt3201 Oct 1, 2006 FAQ12 What is the name of Dexter's boat? What is that red fruit in the opening credits?
