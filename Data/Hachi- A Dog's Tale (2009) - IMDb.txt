His bossy, jealous wife Cate initially makes Parker swear it won't stay, but by the time its' clear nobody will claim him and an adoption candidate is found, she agrees to keep the dog, who won over their daughter Andy and her fiance Michael at first sight. Parker's Japanese college friend Ken inspires naming the pup Hachi(ko), and is pleasantly surprised when Parker successfully tackles the challenge to get it to fetch, which Akitas don't usually do. Hachi makes a habit of waiting for his equally doting master at the station every evening, but after a cardiac crisis, Parker dies. Hachi refuses to accept this, being moved to Michael's home as Cate moves out, waiting for a master who can never come home again, by now collectively adopted by sympathizing town-folk. The story is told in flashbacks as class assignment 'my hero' by Michael's teen son Robbie, who also gets an Akita puppy. —KGF Vissers dogjapaneseloyaltywaitinghuman animal relationship179 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines A true story of faith, devotion and undying love. Genres Biography Drama Family Certificate G Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Hachi is portrayed by three dogs: Chico, Layla, and Forrest. Goofs When Hachi brings the ball to Parker at the station, while Parker opens the door, the reflection of the camera is visible in the window of the door. Quotes Ken: [Talking in Japanese] It's been a year, hasn't it? I wake up sometimes in the middle of the night and think about Parker. He was a good friend. I understand how you feel. Hachi, my friend, Parker is never coming home. But if Hachiko wants to wait, then Hachiko should wait. You want to wait for him, don't you? Have a long life, Hachi. Crazy credits Message near the end of the credits: "Although beloved by many as a family pet, Akitas are recommended only for dedicated and experienced dog owners.

"Love and Loyalty" succinctly sums up the film. The love so simple, so pure and the loyalty so unfailing, so steadfast that it would melt any steel heart. I was so embarrassed that as soon as the film came to the end I dashed straight into the loo only to see my eyes sore red (!!) The main characters never "take flight" but that matters not at all. It's the simple story of the love between a man and his best friend that more than sufficiently works all the wonders. Not a sad one, but profoundly touching, So touching that even a tough guy like me couldn't possibly hold his tears. Hachiko, the Akita dog, has set the Yardstick of loyalty under which all loyalty among us human beings are to be measured. Loyalty that is truly monumental. Loyalty that is to be surpassed only by God Himself. A must-watch film, especially for all dog lovers. Highly recommended for all families and people of all ages. helpful•228 38 pchk-629-36011 Jan 8, 2010 Details Edit Release date March 12, 2010 (United Kingdom) Countries of origin United Kingdom United States Official sites Official site Official site (Germany) Languages English Japanese Also known as 忠犬八公的故事 Filming locations Rhode Island, USA Production companies Stage 6 Films Inferno Distribution Hachiko See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $16,000,000 (estimated) Gross worldwide $46,749,646 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 33 minutes Color Color Sound mix DTS Dolby Digital SDDS Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Nent Group to Produce Klint Biopic With Lena Olin, Lasse Hallström On Board May 10Variety Film + TV Lasse Hallström To Direct Hilma Af Klint Biopic Starring Lena Olin; Producer Nent Group Commits To Making 2 English-Language Movies Per Year May 10Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the streaming release date of Hachi: A Dog's Tale (2009) in Australia?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
