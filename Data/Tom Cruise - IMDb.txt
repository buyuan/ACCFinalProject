Personal Quote: [on Edge of Tomorrow (2014)] The alien invasion is simmering in the background. It's kind of Back to the Future (1985). I love movies that ask, "If you did have to live your life over again, what would happen?". See more » Trivia: His character Lt. Daniel Kaffee in A Few Good Men (1992) was based on real life United States Navy JAG Corp Donald Marcari, who now works as an attorney with Marcari, Russotto, and Spencer P.C. in Chesapeake, Virginia.
