Is it perfect? No. Is it the best disaster movie? No. Is it an enjoyable experience? Yes! The story holds up, their is action throughout, the actors are good and you shouldn't compare it to interstellar... it is what it is. A good sci fi disaster movie. It keeps you on your toes, special effects are really good, I guess this is the strength of this movie. Don't believe it deserves a 5.3 currently. At least a 6 in my opinion. On the lines of " The day after tomorrow". If you liked that I think you should enjoy this.

Both kids and adults will enjoy it. Really interesting concept and story holds up. A bit on the lines of Big Hero 6, Next Gen, Mitchell's against the Machines. If you like animation movies this is a good one to watch. See more▼See less▲ The Tomorrow War (2021) Don't trust the bad reviews! Really enjoyed it 26 October 2021 - 0 out of 1 users found this review helpful. If you love sci fi movies, it's going to be an awesome ride! The story holds up, keeps you on your toes through out, incredibly entertaining and loved the acting. Also I am a huge time-travel fan, so adding that aspect definitely adds to the crunch. I, think this movie deserves more than a 6.6 rating. I was put off cos of the reviews and rating and today decided to go for it, really glad I did. Really enjoyed it.

They stand out and always leave you feeling puzzled thinking about what you just watched. In this particular movie, I left the cinema with no real "wow" factor, it never really got better, you'd just have to watch it yourself if your a Nolan fan. It's almost like they tried to come up with a Nolan vibe concept but it didn't really work out ... or wasn't executed as it should? Don't know... but it's definitely not up there with the other amazing movies. This was the worst one Imo. Confusing most of the time, and you think, it will resolve soon, it will gell together for sure! .. And ... never quite does.. because when it does, it's not the wow you were expecting. Honest 5/10, 6 the most, 8 for the effects, See more▼See less▲ The Day After Tomorrow (2004) Very enjoyable disaster movie! 2 December 2020 I watch many movies, This movie is great! Dont listen to the bad reviews. If you are watching it for exact science, than its definitely not the right movie. I disagree with almost every single reference they made to "global warming" and "ice age " and "10,000 years" and all that. The movie has amazing scenery, effects, story and build up. I would believe it should be at least a 7 See more▼See less▲ The Chosen (2017) This is an incredible work of art and cinema!! 1 October 2020 The Gospels come to life!!! What an amazing piece of work. Me and my wofe watched this and every episode was packed with so much from the word of God and the heart of God! It conveys beautifully the heart of our Lord and the mood of the century He was in. A must watch! Even for non believers. See more▼See less▲ Unplanned (2019) A real depiction of the heart of this matter! 29 August 2019 - 6 out of 23 users found this review helpful. This movie was not shying away from the brutal reality of abortion. With such a relative mindset and mood clouding the atmosphere on so many moral issues these days, this movie breaks that mood and delivers a sobering message of change of perspective in a growing relativistic society. with many people's conscience desensitized, I believe this cuts to the heart and exposes the unnatural nature of abortion and its untold consequences. A MUST watch !
