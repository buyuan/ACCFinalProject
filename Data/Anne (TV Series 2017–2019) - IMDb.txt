Connections Featured in MsMojo: Top 10 Feminist Characters in Teen Shows (2020) User reviews1K Review Top review 10/10 AMAZING #renewannewithane This is one of the most beautiful shows I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I have read the books and though it differs from the books it truly is the closest to perfect television we have gotten in the past 10 years or so. It tackles modern day issues that have been alive throughout time and does so in a thought provoking fascinating way. The acting and production are second to none and it truly deserves another season to continue the storytelling. Anne Shirley Cuthburt is a passionate individual and so are her fans! She is a true role model for every young person today. helpful•179 20 kcomaskey Dec 19, 2019 FAQ4 Will there be a season 4? I am very interested in starting this TV series, but I saw that it was canceled. Can anyone tell me (without spoilers, of course) if the series ended with cliffhangers? Or did it have a closed ending in the third season?
