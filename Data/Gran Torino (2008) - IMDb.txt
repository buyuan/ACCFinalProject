Kowalski is a grumpy, tough-minded, unhappy old man who can't get along with either his kids or his neighbors. He is a Korean War veteran whose prize possession is a 1972 Gran Torino he keeps in mint condition. When his neighbor Thao Lor (Bee Vang), a young Hmong teenager under pressure from his gang member cousin, tries to steal his Gran Torino, Kowalski sets out to reform the youth. Drawn against his will into the life of Thao's family, Kowalski is soon taking steps to protect them from the gangs that infest their neighborhood. —alfiehitchie widowergangteenagerstreet ganggang rape348 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Genre Drama Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for language throughout, and some violence Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Walt's dog, Daisy, is Clint Eastwood's beloved family retriever in real life. Goofs Walt says he used the M1 Garand rifle in Korea. U.S. Military personnel are usually not allowed to keep their service weapons. However, some rifles, identified by serial number, were available for purchase through the Civilian Marksmanship Program after they were deemed obsolete or unfit for service. Enlisted and commissioned personnel also frequently "liberated" their weapons. Quotes Duke: What you lookin' at old man? Walt Kowalski: Ever notice how you come across somebody once in a while you shouldn't have fucked with? That's me. Crazy credits The credits scroll over a highway overlooking the lake shore, with the Warner Logo appearing in black and white.

I saw the film and it was unbelievable. Clint Eastwood will have you laughing so hard you almost pee yourself while at the same time breaking your heart and making you want to cry. The movie takes you on a roller-coaster ride and the entire theater stood up in applause afterward. I highly recommend this film and if Eastwood doesn't get nominated for an Oscar something is truly wrong!!! The screening I saw was held at the Writer's Guild, so the room was filled with SAG, WGA, DGA, and other industry related people who I would wage know their movies. At points the entire room was laughing so loud I couldn't hear, and then minutes later all you could hear were the sniffles from people crying. The film has drama, comedy, and action and Clint Eastwood really creates a character that you care about and cheer for...again! helpful•706 200 bill2594 Dec 10, 2008 FAQ5 What is 'Gran Torino' about?
