Genres Action Thriller Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia In the credits you can see that the movie is shot entirely at "Bentwaters Park" in Suffolk (UK). Royal Air Force Bentwaters or more simply RAF Bentwaters, now known as "Bentwaters Parks", is a former Royal Air Force station about 80 miles (130 km) northeast of London. Goofs When the sheriff opens the box of medication and throws one tablet into Dylan's mouth, the box of medication is opened obviously. Then Jo walks in and you can clearly see that the box of medication is closed (although the box has not been touched). And 10 seconds later when Jo is pouring coffee for Dylan and the sheriff, you can see that the box of medication is open again. This is easy to spot as the box is orange and the cap is white. User reviews35 Review Top review 8/10 Exactly what I expected Not sure what others were expecting with this movie but it was exactly what I expected. I would have rated it 6/10 and rated it a little higher to offset the trollers. As you'd expect, it's a kick ass, shoot-em up movie. Lot's of action and no Shakespearean fairy dust. No memorable lines or scenes and I wouldn't have expected any anyway. Good enough to watch a few times in my movie archives. helpful•16 5 dannyrest Nov 6, 2021 Details Edit Release date November 5, 2021 (Poland) Country of origin United Kingdom Official site Official press release Languages English French Also known as 원샷 Production companies Fiction Films Screen Media Films Signature Films See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 36 minutes Color Color Related news "Distant Voices, Still Lives" in One Shot Nov 15MUBI ‘One Shot’ Review Nov 9Nerdly Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was One Shot (2021) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
