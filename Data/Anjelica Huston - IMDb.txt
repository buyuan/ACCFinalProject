Personal Quote: [on working with her father John Huston on Prizzi's Honor (1985)] We had a great time on Prizzi's Honor. My father is extremely easy to work with. He chooses his actors, places his confidence in them and lets you get on with it. He is living proof that a director doesn't have to run all over the place.
