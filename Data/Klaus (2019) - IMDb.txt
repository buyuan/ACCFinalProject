Jesper is about to give up when he finds an ally in local teacher Alva (Rashida Jones), and discovers Klaus (Oscar® winner J.K. Simmons), a mysterious carpenter who lives alone in a cabin full of handmade toys. These unlikely friendships return laughter to Smeerensburg, forging a new legacy of generous neighbors, magical lore and stockings hung by the chimney with care. An animated Christmas comedy directed by Despicable Me co-creator Sergio Pablos, KLAUS co-stars Rashida Jones, Jason Schwartzman and JK Simmons. —Netflix christmasfriendshipislandforestsanta87 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Discover the friendship that launched a legend. Genres Animation Adventure Comedy Family Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG for rude humor and mild action Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Director Sergio Pablos had wanted to do a traditionally animated feature film, but he wanted to see how the animation would have evolved without the switch to computer-generated animation. So the studio used CGI lighting techniques with hand-drawn animation to create a unique animation style for the story. Goofs Just after Jesper is explaining to the kid who got coal that only good children get presents, he slams open the lower part of his door, which passes right through two children standing in front of it. Quotes Klaus: A true selfless act always sparks another. Crazy credits The title doesn't appear onscreen until the end of the film.

About how little kindnesses can make life more beautiful, children's laughter can warm the heart and Christmas can actually be a beautiful contemplative time. A truly beautiful Christmas story is told here with humour and love for detail. For young and old.
