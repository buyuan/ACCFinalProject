His global pursuit finds him smack dab in the middle of a daring heist where he's forced to partner with the world's greatest art thief Nolan Booth (Ryan Reynolds) in order to catch the world's most wanted art thief, "The Bishop" (Gal Gadot). The high-flying adventure that ensues takes the trio around the world, across the dance floor, trapped in a secluded prison, into the jungle and, worst of all for them, constantly into each other's company. —Netflix thiefheistchaserivalryart161 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Pro and Cons Genres Action Adventure Comedy Crime Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for violence and action, some sexual references, and strong language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Both Ryan Reynolds and Dwayne Johnson drink their own brands of liquor as their characters.
