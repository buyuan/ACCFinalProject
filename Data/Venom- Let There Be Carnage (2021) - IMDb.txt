Quotes [from trailer] Mrs. Chen: The chocolate delivery hasn't arrived yet. Venom: NO! Eddie Brock: We had a deal. Mrs. Chen: What's gonna happen? You're gonna stop protecting me? Venom: I am happy to eat Mrs. Chen! Eddie Brock: No, no. You cannot eat Mrs. Chen. Mrs. Chen: What? Eddie Brock: Nothing.

Connections Edited from Spider-Man: Far from Home (2019) Soundtracks Feel My Heart (Tim Besamusca Remix) Written by Gary James Robinson & Tim Besamusca Performed by Moments of Darkness User reviews799 Review Top review 4/10 The Art of Genetic Movie Engineering Marvel and DC these days remind me of those big players of the worldwide cheeseburger "distribution network" - the products always taste the same, because the ingredients are always accurately of the same nature and made the same way. Always. The same applies these days to those entertainment companies - you already know what to expect if a new show or movie leaves the factories of those big players of genetic movie engineering. Venom: Let There Be Carnage is not a candidate for the worst movie categories nor a total bore or fail, it is just a part of that endless and constant stream of "entertainment" these factories produce: easy to consume, easy to forget. Long gone are the times when I heard people talking about a new movie or show of those "big" players. Disappointed? No, it's just business as usual. helpful•96 29 Tweetienator Oct 4, 2021 FAQ2 Why isn't Topher Grace returning as Venom?
