Shorten that to every second, and you've got Coupling. It's more than just a one night stand! When a couple gets together, it's never just the two of them - they also bring baggage - and Susan and Steve are no exception. Their baggage is a crowd of best friends and exes who talk about all aspects of sex and relationships on their never-ending quest to find true love. Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps... Susan Walker is a beautiful go-getter with an uninhibited attitude who used to date Patrick Maitland, the sextet's charismatic, cocky player, London's king of conquests - a guy who's just too cool to worry about being smart. Attractive Sally Harper is a beauty therapist who is Susan's unashamedly vain best friend, who aggressively battles aging with heavy doses of moisturizer and men - including Patrick. Meanwhile, Steve Taylor, while getting together with Susan, can't seem to shake loose from his vivacious and slightly vacuous ex-girlfriend Jane Christie, a woman supremely confident in her ability to seduce anyone of either sex, and who refuses to be dumped unless she's the one doing the dumping. Jeff Murdoch is Steve's "porn buddy" who is, in equal parts, obsessed and bewildered by actual sex; charming in his way, but with an uncanny ability to say the wrong thing at the worst possible time. He works in the same office as Susan, with whom he had a disastrous and unsuccessful one-night fling. Coupling has been honoured with the prestigious Silver Rose of Montreux, Best TV Comedy Award, and is recent winner at the 2003 British Comedy Awards. With a new guy on the scene, a baby on the way, commitment in the air, and love on the horizon, the dynamics of the six friends are definitely changing. At the end of last season Susan and Steve discovered they were pregnant (well, mostly Susan), confirmed bachelor Patrick and Sally finally admitted their true feelings for each other, and poor Jane was left on her own, once again. But it's not all doom and gloom for Jane. As the new season opens, things are looking up. There's this guy called Oliver, who has his eye on her. Is it possible that lifetime loser in love Oliver might just get somewhere with lifetime loser in love Jane? Trouble is, his apartment is a little "un-edited" and his living room has lost the battle with magazine nudity... Susan and Steve are now well and truly an item. So why is he dreaming about being executed by a fetus with an axe? Meanwhile Sally and Patrick are settling into their new relationship. But since the dawn of time, men and women have been falling in love - and men have been trying to get home straight afterwards. Can fallen playboy Patrick ever find his way back from the enchanted glade of his one true love and get a decent night's sleep? —I'm_So_Sexy friendshipboyfriend girlfriend relationshipsitcomcouplebritish comedy40 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines It's better than foreplay! Genres Comedy Romance Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia When Richard Coyle read for the part of Jeff, he spoke in a Welsh accent. The character wasn't written Welsh, but the producers liked it and hired him. It wasn't until well into the second series that they realized that Coyle was not Welsh, just putting it on for the show. Ironically, when Welsh actor Richard Mylan was cast as Oliver, he had to put off his accent in order to make the character less similar to Jeff. Quotes Jeff: When God made the arse, he didn't say, 'Hey, it's just your basic hinge, let's knock off early.' He said, 'Behold ye angels, I have created the arse. Throughout the ages to come, men and women shall grab hold of these, and shout my name! Connections Featured in Coupling: Behind the Scenes (2002) Soundtracks Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps Written by Osvaldo Farrés, Joseph Davis Performed by Mari Wilson User reviews143 Review Top review I totally disagree with the previous review! I totally disagree with the previous reviewer's comments. I found "Coupling" to be hilarious. It was unlike anything I had ever seen before. This person seemed to be totally confused as to the origins of the show. First it is said to be a copy of an American show, then it is stated that it is unbelievable that America wants to make their own version. It is originally a British show. It will tell you that on the special features of the DVD. The special features also include a lovely story about how the concept of the show came about. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and mine is that "Coupling", while different, is brilliant and should be given a chance by all to form their own opinions of it. By the way, here's an example of the hilarity: Sally: Mary Kelly thinks you're a complete idiot. Patrick: Then why does she keep looking at my arse when we're talking? Sally: She's lip-reading. helpful•181 22 tiggergoddess76 Jun 26, 2004 Details Edit Release date May 12, 2000 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Official site BBCi (United Kingdom) Language English Also known as Parckanje Filming locations Chiswick, London, England, UK Production companies BBC Studios Hartswood Films See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 30 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 1.78 : 1 Related news 10 Things You Didn’t Know about Gina Bellman Jul 3TVovermind.com The Office: The 5 Best (& 5 Worst) Recurring Characters Oct 20ScreenRant.com Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Spanish language plot outline for Coupling (2000)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
