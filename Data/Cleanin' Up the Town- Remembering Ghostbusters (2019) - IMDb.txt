This is a great documentary, behind the scenes, how it was written, the casting...I'm just surprised it's taken so many years to materialize. I thought in the wake of the new movie coming out it would at least get a mention but no...this is about the first Ghostbusters movie from the 80's. A great insight. helpful•5 0 eskimosound Jul 5, 2020 Details Edit Release date January 7, 2020 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Official site Official Facebook Language English Production company Bueno Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 2 hours 8 minutes Color Color Related news Win a signed Cleanin’ Up the Town: Remembering Ghostbusters Blu-ray Jun 21HeyUGuys.co.uk Documentary Cleanin’ Up The Town: Remembering Ghostbusters coming to Blu-ray and Crackle Jun 16Flickeringmyth Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Cleanin' Up the Town: Remembering Ghostbusters (2019) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
