Alan would have been the only person living there, except for an airline pilot, who would live in the other wing, and occasionally walk past Alan. Goofs Although Alan Partridge comes from Norwich in East Anglia, on occasion Steve Coogan's Manchester accent comes through in the character. Quotes Alan Partridge: You work in a petrol station Michael. It's not the Gulf War. Which ironically is like a large petrol station. Alternate versions Talkback Production's BBC comedy series 'I'm Alan Partridge' features an extra 20 minutes of footage when purchased on video. During the extra footage Alan Partridge suggests an idea for a television programme. His idea is a programme called 'Bonnington' - starring Brian Blessed. Alan says: "A screen mountaineering adventure with Brian Blessed in the title role. We could film on location on Everest with close-ups on Skarfelt pike; no-one will know the difference, we'll just paint the rocks white. I also know for a fact that Brian Blessed can work at high altitudes without oxygen -- which should cut costs". Connections Featured in The British Comedy Awards 1998 (1998) User reviews58 Review Top review The best British comedy of the '90s Like Fawlty Towers in the '70s and Blackadder in the '80s, this is British comedy at its very best - a handful of episodes, all of them tighter line-for-line than Alan's shorts ("the boys are back in the barracks"). Partridge may well be the most ingeniously unsympathetic character ever created - every time you start to feel sorry for him, he manages to do something truly unspeakable. Painfully funny. helpful•30 3 eastie Dec 8, 1999 FAQ1 Who is Alan Partridge?
