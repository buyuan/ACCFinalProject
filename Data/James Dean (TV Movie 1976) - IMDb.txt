James Dean got a job there as an usher through his friend, William Bast (who wrote this film), who was also an usher. Butler was unimpressed with Dean's "abilities" and fired him. Quotes [opening narration] Narrator: His name was James Byron Dean. He was an actor. He died in 1955 at the age of 24. He had starred in just three pictures, only one of which had been released prior to his death. Yet before he was in his grave he was already a myth. What you are about to see is one man's recollection - an image of the actor as seen through the eyes of a friend. Like all memories in is intensely personal, elusive and incomplete - yet it refuses to die. User reviews11 Review Top review 7/10 interesting look at the life of a legend. This made-for-TV movie tells the life of James Dean as seen through the eyes of his friend and roommate, William Bast. It was very interesting too watch because not only was it the life story of Jimmy, but in a way it was also about William. You have to admire him for being so open about his private life. The film is also notable for hinting at Jimmy's flirting with bisexuality. It's a unique look at James Dean, and Stephen McHattie, though he looks nothing like Jimmy, has his mannerisms down perfectly. "James Dean" (1976) is a very poignant film, especially worth it for a dramatic and touching reading of The Little Prince. I would have given it a higher grade but I was too distracted by all the anachronisms. ('70s hair and clothes in the '50s). But the actors were great, so otherwise it's a good film. helpful•5 1 That_Beatles_Girl Sep 7, 2007 Details Edit Release date February 19, 1976 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as James Dean: Portrait of a Friend Filming locations Universal Studios - 100 Universal City Plaza, Universal City, California, USA Production companies The Jozak Company William Bast Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 34 minutes Color Color Sound mix Mono Aspect ratio 1.33 : 1 Related news Jon Bell’s ‘The Moogai’ triumphs at SXSW Mar 21IF.com.au Second Opinion – Born to Be Blue (2015) Jul 21Flickeringmyth Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
