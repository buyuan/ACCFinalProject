Fry is a twenty-five-year-old pizza delivery boy whose life is going nowhere. When he accidentally freezes himself on December 31, 1999, he wakes up one thousand years in the future, and has a chance to make a fresh start. He goes to work for the Planet Express Corporation, a futuristic delivery service that transports packages to all five quadrants of the universe. His companions include the delivery ship's Captain, Leela, a beautiful one-eyed female alien who kicks some serious butt, and Bender, a robot with very human flaws. —Ronos alienrobotdelivery boyfuturedoctor170 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines The future is here! Genres Animation Comedy Sci-Fi Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Bender's apartment door number, 00100100, is binary for the dollar sign $. Goofs The elements Bender claims to be constructed out of change throughout the series (though given Bender's nature, it's possible he's lying). This became an in-joke amongst the writers in later episodes. Quotes Fry: You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but don't pay you or let you go. Turanga Leela: That's the only thing about being a slave. Crazy credits Though the cartoons shown on the giant monitor are usually old, vintage cartoons (most likely public domain), on at least one instance a clip from a Simpsons short (from the Tracey Ullman Show) was used (Matt Groening created both Futurama and the Simpsons). Alternate versions Originally, one episode had a scene where Fry pulls down his pants and moons the business magnate Mom (of Mom's Friendly Robots). Her original dialogue was, "You call that an anus?", but it only appeared in closed captioning and was redubbed with "You call that a pressed ham?". Connections Edited into The Lost Adventure (2008) User reviews364 Review Top review A Misunderstood Series Futurama is the whipping boy of modern prime time cartoons. Since it was made by the creator of the Simpsons it was expected to be exactly like it. Futurama had its own brand of comedic flair, which is absolutely hilarious. Bender, Fry, Leela, Hermes, Zoidberg, all of these characters are well thought out and work incredibly well together, on top of the fact that situations and anecdotes from previous episodes are brought up all the time, adding continuity to an already excellent series. I'll admit that I too was among the people crying foul when Futurama first came out, I didn't grow to truly appreciate it until it was put in syndication on adult swim, and more so later as I bought all the episodes on DVD. I don't think the world was ready for what futurama had to offer when it first came out, and everyone should give it another shot through adult swim or by DVD rental. It has solid entertainment value, and a unique comedic style. 4.5 out of 5 stars helpful•320 22 justinprime Sep 29, 2004 FAQ10 How many seasons are there of Futurama? Who owns the rights to Futurama?
