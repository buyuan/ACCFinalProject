Anderson is a man living two lives. By day he is an average computer programmer and by night a hacker known as Neo. Neo has always questioned his reality, but the truth is far beyond his imagination. Neo finds himself targeted by the police when he is contacted by Morpheus, a legendary computer hacker branded a terrorist by the government. As a rebel against the machines, Neo must confront the agents: super-powerful computer programs devoted to stopping Neo and the entire human rebellion. —redcommander27 simulated realityartificial realitywar with machinesdystopiapost apocalypse355 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Free your mind Genres Action Sci-Fi Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for sci-fi violence and brief language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The opening action scene took six months of training and four days to shoot. Goofs The name of the software company Neo works at is spelled "METACORTEX" on the outside of the building, but a sign inside the building has it spelled "META CORTECHS". Featurettes suggest that the name was changed to avoid an expensive legal issue; evidently one of the signs was missed. Quotes Morpheus: This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill - the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill - you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes. Crazy credits At the end of all the credits, the URL for the (now defunct) website of the film is given, www.whatisthematrix.com, along with a password, 'steak'. There's a 'secret' link on the page that requests a password. Alternate versions Because 'The Matrix' was filmed in Australia the Region 4 (Australia) DVD release includes a more comprehensive Australian based list of credits.
