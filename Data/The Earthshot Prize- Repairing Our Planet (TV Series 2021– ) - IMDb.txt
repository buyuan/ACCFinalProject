It deals with the harrowing fact that we humans are wreaking havoc on this beautiful planet. What is wrong with it? It IS a FACT. Sir, David Attenborough is laying bare the destruction we are inflicting on the Plant and presents solutions. We thoughtlessly consume we carelessly exploit resources, quenching our lust for more and more and we do not look behind to see the trail of destruction we leave. helpful•0 0 farshidkarimi Nov 14, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 3, 2021 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Production companies BBC One BBC iPlayer Discovery Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was The Earthshot Prize: Repairing Our Planet (2021) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
