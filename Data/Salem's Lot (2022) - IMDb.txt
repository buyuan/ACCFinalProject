For this latest take on the novel, regular Wan collaborator Gary Dauberman is working on a script for New Line Cinema. The film will be produced by Wan, Roy Lee and Mark Wolper, while Dauberman will also executive produce the project. The scribe has been finding a lot of work in the horror genre lately, having co-written the 2017 adaptation of King's It, as well as penning the upcoming It: Chapter Two. He also wrote the scripts for the Wan-produced Annabelle and Annabelle Creation, and has just wrapped filming on his directorial debut, Annabelle Comes Home. James Wan is also attached to an upcoming feature based on Stephen King's 1987 novel The Tommyknockers.
