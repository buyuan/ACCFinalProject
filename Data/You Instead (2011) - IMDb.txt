When they meet the girls from the band The Dirty Pinks, Adam has an argument with the lead singer Morello. A preacher separates them and asks the two bands to pray together. Out of the blue, he handcuffs Adam and Morello and leaves the place in a golf cart. When The Dirty Pinks have to perform, Adam participates with the group and their show is a success. They are forced to spend the night together and his girlfriend Lake and her boyfriend Mark stay with them. But soon they feel that Adam and Morello are connected not only by the handcuffs. —Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil handcuff keyhand prunerfour people in bedkisslesbian kiss20 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines A single night. A million possibilities. One connection. Genres Comedy Drama Music Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for language and some sexual material Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia Two of the songs performed in the film were written by Luke Treadaway and Natalia Tena who play Adam and Morello, respectively. Goofs When Adam and Morello exit the shower Morello is still wearing most of her ripped off white t-shirt and her black skirt. In the next scene when she and Adam flop on the couch her white t-shirt and skirt are gone and she is just wearing her black tank top and underwear. Quotes The Prophet: Nobody is going to save the planet but you folks, you know that? You cram a hundred thousand people together, no music. What do you get? A riot. You give them music, we all in this together. Music turns a mob into a movement. Soundtracks You Instead (Accoustic Version) Written by Luke Treadaway Performed by The Make Produced by R. Capuano and C. Shelswell Additional vocals by Nicola Leighton Recorded at The Doghouse, Glasfow Engineered by Sean Kerwin Published by L. Treadaway/ R. Capuano/ C. Shelswell/ Sigma Film Ltd User reviews17 Review Top review 7/10 Very predictable. Very cheesy. Very un-original. All that said this is still very good. I recommend this. I say B+ "If musicians can't get along what hope we got?" After Morello (Tena) shakes Adam's (Treadway) car in order to make him stop playing guitar they start to fight. When a security guard drives by and sees them he decides the only way to make them get along is to handcuff them together. That sounds bad enough but they are at a music festival and are both scheduled to play and no one knows where the key is. For those that have been following my reviews you may have noticed that I am not a fan of cheesy, predictable, un-original movies. This movie is an exception to that rule. Five minutes in the two are handcuffed together and after about 6 minutes you know how it will end. That said it is still very entertaining and really fun to watch. The music is actually really good as well and the song where the sample "Tainted Love" is great. This is nothing more then a cheesy predictable love story but even so I enjoyed it and I recommend it. Overall, nothing new and won't keep you guessing but this is still very much worth seeing. I really liked it. I give it an B+. helpful•11 5 cosmo_tiger Jul 13, 2012 Details Edit Release date September 16, 2011 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Official sites Official Facebook Official Facebook (United States) Language English Also known as Tonight You're Mine Filming locations Scotland, UK Production companies BBC Films Head Gear Films Metrol Technology See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget £1,000,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $6,255 Opening weekend US & Canada $2,144 May 13, 2012 Gross worldwide $132,787 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 20 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Amazon Prime Video New Releases: November 2020 Nov 3Den of Geek Amazon Prime Announces Over 75 New Movies/TV Shows For November Oct 20We Got This Covered Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was You Instead (2011) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
