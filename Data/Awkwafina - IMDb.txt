Personal Quote: When you're playing a live-action character, you're confined to that dimensionality. But playing something as big as Sisu, you're given the ability to go into that skin; there were a lot of points when I felt 'big'. Hopefully not a couple of tonnes heavy and powerful and could do things I couldn't do as a human. It was a powerful feeling.
