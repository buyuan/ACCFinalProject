Genres Crime Drama Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for violence and language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Al Pacino was offered $5 million to reprise his role as Michael. But Pacino wanted $7 million plus a percentage of the gross. Francis Ford Coppola refused. He threatened to rewrite the script by starting the story with Michael's funeral sequence instead of the film's introduction. Pacino agreed to the $5 million offer. Goofs The Opera Cavalleria Rusticana is shown out of chronological order. The prologue is shown first (Anthony singing backstage), followed by a scene near the end. The procession scene shown next, is actually in the middle of the opera. Then the conclusion is shown. Quotes Michael Corleone: Never hate your enemies. It affects your judgment. Alternate versions Video release is called "Final Director's Cut" and features 9 minutes of additional footage not included in theatrical version. Connections Edited into The Godfather Trilogy: 1901-1980 (1992) Soundtracks TO EACH HIS OWN Written by Jay Livingston and Ray Evans Performed by Al Martino User reviews759 Review Top review 7/10 The Godfather Coda: Don't waste you money I was extremely excited to see the new cut of The Godfather Part III. I bought a digital copy. As I was seeing the movie, I could barely notice any changes. By the trailer of this movies, I was led to believe that Sofia Coppola's role was going to be drastically cut; that was not the case. As you probably now, her acting has been the biggest point of contention against Part III. After the movie ended, I felt that I was cheated. The differences in The Godfather Part III and The Godfather Coda are just too small to make a big deal out of them. I was expecting to see a big improvement that take this movie closer to the level of the first two parts, but was very disappointed. helpful•22 3 hcruzado Dec 12, 2020 FAQ9 What is 'The Godfather III' about?
