Gawain contends with ghosts, giants, thieves, and schemers in what becomes a deeper journey to define his character and prove his worth in the eyes of his family and kingdom by facing the ultimate challenger. From visionary filmmaker David Lowery comes a fresh and bold spin on a classic tale from the knights of the round table. medieval knightmythmiddle agesbased on legendsir gawain character225 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines When honor was everything. When courage made kings. Genres Adventure Drama Fantasy Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for violence, some sexuality and graphic nudity Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Essel wears bells on her shroud because during the Middle Ages it was common for people who were considered unclean, such as prostitutes and lepers, to be forced to wear bells on their clothing to warn others of their presence. Goofs The film is set in medieval Britain, but the spelling used throughout the Green Knight's letter is written in US English. Although it is common for movies to "translate" characters' dialogue, having blatant Americanisms in a British period piece is generally considered a big no-no even in this context. It would be more interesting and believable if the letter were written in British spelling. Quotes [last lines] Green Knight: Well done, my brave knight. Now... off with your head. Crazy credits There is a short scene at the very end of the credits. Connections Featured in The 93rd Oscars (2021) User reviews1.5K Review Top review 5/10 Moves along at a snail's pace. The Green Knight is an adaptation of the story, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Gawain(Dev Patel) goes on an adventure, to fulfill his destiny with the Green Knight(Ralph Ineson). The Green Knight is a mediocre film. Director David Lowery has given us an extremely dull & dragging movie, that is just filled with ambiguity. Maybe viewers have to read the source material to truly enjoy this film. The cinematography by Andrew Droz Palermo is breathtaking & is the only strong point of the movie. Dev Patel is good as Gawain. Alicia Vikander is awesome as Essel/The Lady. Ralph Ineson is effective as the Green Knight. The supporting cast is impressive. The Green Knight is not worth a watch. Watch it, only if you want to get bored out of your mind. helpful•23 6 Anurag-Shetty Sep 1, 2021 Details Edit Release date July 30, 2021 (Canada) Countries of origin Ireland Canada United States United Kingdom Official sites Official Facebook Official Instagram Language English Also known as 绿衣骑士 Filming locations Cahir Castle, Cahir, County Tipperary, Ireland Production companies Sailor Bear BRON Studios A24 See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross US & Canada $17,173,321 Opening weekend US & Canada $6,790,917 Aug 1, 2021 Gross worldwide $18,873,029 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 2 hours 10 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Dolby Atmos Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Augustine Frizzell to Direct ‘The Invisible Life of Addie Larue’ Film Adaptation for eOne (Exclusive) Nov 16Variety Film + TV Frances McDormand Could Be the First Person Nominated for Best Picture and Acting Oscars Consecutively Nov 15Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the streaming release date of The Green Knight (2021) in Brazil?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
