Plot summary Add synopsis Genre Music Parents guide Add content advisory User reviews3 Review Top review 10/10 So entertaining! It's crazy how much effort people put into their covers. Some entertainers look so similar and sound so real! It is amazing and very entertaining and definite worth a watch. It seems like they have a lot of different artists and genres lined up; so keep with it and those who are dissing the show need to be patient until those other big or rock n roll names come up. helpful•0 0 emilywalczak Nov 10, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 13, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Production companies Electric Hot Dog Universal Television Alternative Studios See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 30 minutes Related news This Clash of the Cover Bands Transformation Into Aretha Franklin Will Give You Goosebumps Nov 17E!
