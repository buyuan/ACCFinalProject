Within this world exist two rebels on the run who just might be able to restore order. There's Max, a man of action and a man of few words, who seeks peace of mind following the loss of his wife and child in the aftermath of the chaos. And Furiosa, a woman of action and a woman who believes her path to survival may be achieved if she can make it across the desert back to her childhood homeland. —Production post apocalypsedesertcar chaseescapechase355 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines WHAT A LOVELY DAY (all caps One Sheet) Genres Action Adventure Sci-Fi Thriller Certificate (Banned) Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Over eighty percent of the effects seen in the film are practical effects, including stunts, make-up, and sets. CGI was used sparingly, mainly to enhance the Namibian landscape, remove stunt rigging, and for Imperator Furiosa's (Charlize Theron) left arm, which is a prosthetic limb. Goofs There are several scenes in which people, including The Splendid Angharad, grab onto the vertical exhaust pipes for support while crawling around on the outside of cabin of the War Rig. Truck exhausts can often reach temperatures greater than 350 degrees Fahrenheit, which would have made holding onto them with bare hands impossible. Quotes Nux: [In the midst of a massive, violent sandstorm, after witnessing his fellow War Boys sucked off the War Rig into a vortex] Oh, what a day... what a lovely day! Crazy credits Near the end of the credits there is a memorial dedication that reads "Lance Allen Moore II, May 24, 1987 - March 10, 2015." Apparently Moore was a Mad Max fan killed in a motorcycle accident near Silverton, New South Wales, Australia, where Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1981) was filmed. Alternate versions A "PG-13" version was created, but only screened for American test-audiences. Positive feedback towards the "R-rated" version convinced Warner Bros to release it, theatrically.

Albert & Son Pty Limited User reviews2.1K Review Top review 8/10 very great movie The mood of the film is one of the film's positive aspects. The end-of-the-world atmosphere is awesome, and the tale is good, and the movie is also interesting from beginning to end, with Tom Hardy as a highly successful hero and the role definitely worthy of him, but there is one flaw: the visual effects. There are a few moments where the effects aren't quite right. Overall, the film is enjoyable. helpful•6 2 trapp_33 Oct 13, 2021 FAQ13 Is this a sequel or a reboot? What is Max Rockatansky's origin?
