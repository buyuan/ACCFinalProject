Connections Featured in Conan: Elvis Costello/Nathan Fielder/La Santa Cecilia (2015) User reviews70 Review Top review 10/10 Manipulative and Hilarious Nathan has a very clever way of manipulating people, whether it's the people he's supposedly trying to help or the customers he is trying to lure. It's not malicious, just hilarious. His ideas are ridiculous and completely irrational but the funny thing is that they work. From creating viral videos that end up on the news to creating TV shows that girls want to be in to promote themselves... it all illuminates how easily people can be suckered into things especially in the world of business and TV. If you're not amazed by the cleverness of the concepts and you don't like deadpan humor then it may not be for you. But there's nothing really like it and I hope more people find out about it because it deserves a good long run. helpful•109 4 pieeatingpirate Jul 10, 2014 Details Edit Release date February 28, 2013 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Comedy Central (United States) Comedy Network (Canada) Language English Also known as Нейтан для тебе Production companies Abso Lutely Productions Blow Out Productions WDM See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 30 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news ‘How To With John Wilson’ Season 2 Trailer: HBO’s Unique Comedy Series Answers More Questions Later This Month Nov 10The Playlist AnnaSophia Robb Is Just as Intrigued and Horrified by Dr. Death as the Rest of Us Jul 15Popsugar.com Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Japanese language plot outline for Nathan for You (2013)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
