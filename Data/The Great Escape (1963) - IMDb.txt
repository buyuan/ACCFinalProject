Their leader decides to try to take out several hundred all at once. The first half of the movie is played for comedy, as the prisoners mostly outwit their jailers to dig the escape tunnel. The second half is high adventure as they use planes, trains, and boats to get out of occupied Europe. —John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> escape from prisonescapetunnel1940sprisoner of war camp161 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines put a fence in front of these men...and they'll climb it... Genres Adventure Drama History Thriller War Certificate Approved Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia One day, the police in the German town where this movie was shot set up a speed trap near the set. Several members of the cast and crew were caught, including Steve McQueen. The Chief of Police told McQueen "Herr McQueen, we have caught several of your comrades today, but you have won the prize (for the highest speeding)." McQueen was arrested and briefly jailed. Goofs Timbers are needed to hold back thousands of pounds of dirt from a tunnel collapse. The three feet long, 1/2 inch thick pieces taken from the bed frames shown used in the tunnel could not withstand the weight. However documentary interviews and excavation of the actual Stalag Luft 3 site, shows that the films depiction of the tunnel's construction was accurate. While the material used may not have been adequate for a professional tunnel or mine, they were apparently adequate for the task and some are still holding up the tunnel even now. Quotes Sedgwick: Danny, do you speak Russian? Danny: A little, but only one sentence. Sedgwick: Well, let me have it, mate. Danny: Ya vas lyublyu. Sedgwick: Ya ya vas... Danny: Lyublyu. Sedgwick: Lyubliu? Ya vas lyubliu. Ya vas lyublyu. What's it mean? Danny: I love you. Sedgwick: Love you. What bloody good is that? Danny: I don't know, I wasn't going to use it myself. Alternate versions Some TV versions edit the scene in which Ives is shot and killed for trying to escape over the fence. Connections Edited into Return to 'The Great Escape' (1993) User reviews394 Review Top review 10/10 Great Escape,Great movie This must be my favorite movie of all times. Having seen it for the first time,in I guess 1987,a BBC Christmas broadcast,I was captivated by this brilliant piece of work. In the years after,I probably have seen it a "million" times,owning it on VHS and DVD,and still watching,whenever it is broadcast,in the original language. Why is it so great? This is a movie that keeps you locked to the screen,because it has everything a great movie should have. A great story,a good length,tension,it is a WW2 movie and the actors give top performances.Not just Steve McQueen,although his performance is brilliant,but also James Garner,James Coburn,Richard Attenborough,Charles Bronson and in this film,one of the greatest roles Donald Pleasance,playing the forger. It isn't historically accurate,please read the book by Paul Brickhill,but that doesn't matter a bit. This film gives you an image of POW camp,the prisoners and their guards,the Germans are also played brilliantly by German actors. I will not repeat the story here,but I can tell you,this film will capture you,all the characters are portrayed brilliantly by the actors. There is excitement,humor,tension,drama and emotion. See it,you will not regret it. helpful•141 36 bas-21 Dec 25, 2005 FAQ9 What is 'The Great Escape' about? Is this movie based on a book? Is this a true story?
