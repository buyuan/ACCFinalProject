Connections Features Achims Hitparade (1989) Soundtracks Harmonium Performed by Max Richter User reviews5 Review Top review 3/10 As we had really awful acne What I first heard about this movie is that it is based on a "cult book" about a group of youths in the years before and after the German unification (1989), which was apparently deemed "impossible to turn into a movie" due to its tumescent (500+ pages) and incoherent style of narration. Well, they can't accuse the script writer and the director of not being true to the original. The narration of the movie is equally choppy and ambling. There are a few story lines, such as when the gang of friends manages to start a successful techno club, but mostly we witness a bunch of highly unlikable louts who drink excessively, smoke excessively, take drugs, have no sex whatsoever, and mostly wreck everything in sight. Sorry, let me rephrase that. We witness a bunch of ACTORS who desperately try to act reckless and unfettered. They shoplift, they joyride, they road-rage through Leipzig screaming and throwing bottles, and finally they wreck a whole street full of cars. When the obligatory skinheads (we're in post-unification East Germany, kids) arrive on the scene, I was almost rooting for them. Anything to stop those pinheads. I had zero sympathy for the protagonists. So, after seemingly endless drunken strobe-lit techno orgies, they all end up in jail, or dead, or as prostitutes or junkies? That's bleak, or histrionic, perhaps, but it's simply not interesting. If then the critics of German broadsheet FAZ call this film "world class cinema", I hope they're not talking about this planet. helpful•30 37 Karl Self Mar 16, 2015 Details Edit Release date February 26, 2015 (Germany) Countries of origin Germany France Official sites Official Facebook Official site (Germany) Language German Also known as As We Were Dreaming Filming locations Dresden, Saxony, Germany Production companies Rommel Film Iskremas Filmproduktion Cinémadefacto See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross worldwide $334,069 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 57 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Berlin Competition Final Lineup Includes Wim Wenders, Oliver Hirschbiegel Jan 19Deadline Terrence Malick’s mysterious 'Knight of Cups' to debut at Berlin Film Festival Dec 15Hitfix Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Als wir träumten (2015) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
