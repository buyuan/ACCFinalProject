Personal Quote: [In an interview during filming of Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983), he expressed his fondness for Chewbacca] He's very laid back, and he never completely knows what's going on around him. He isn't a heroic character, but he gets himself in these situations where he's got to come through.
