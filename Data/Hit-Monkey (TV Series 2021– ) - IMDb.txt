Genres Animation Action Adventure Comedy Fantasy Sci-Fi Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia In February 2019, it was announced that Marvel Television was developing an adult animated television series based on M.O.D.O.K., with a series order at Hulu, along with ones based on Hit-Monkey, Tigra and Dazzler, and Howard the Duck, that were intended to lead up to a crossover special titled The Offenders. In December 2019, Marvel Television was folded into Marvel Studios, which carried subsequent oversight of the series. The following month, Marvel decided not to move forward with Howard the Duck, Tigra & Dazzler, and The Offenders, with M.O.D.O.K. (2021) and Hit Monkey continuing as planned.
