A recently-single dad still raw from divorce, he finds out that his kidneys are failing and that he urgently needs a transplant, but can't find anyone willing to help him. His luck changes when he reconnects with a woman he knew a long time ago. Gina has made some unconventional choices--living in her mom's basement, being a driver for a senior-citizens' van--but her decision to become Drew's organ donor will have a lasting impact on Drew that goes beyond saving his life. organlaugh track Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Comedy Drama Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Connections Featured in The 73rd Primetime Emmy Awards (2021) User reviews160 Review Top review 7/10 Decent This lacks the freshness of other Chuck Lorre shows like The Big Bang Theory and Two and a Half Men, but it seems ok. It is basically the story of a man in need of a kidney and finally finds one in a party girl from his past. I think it could pick up steam given some time and its creator. ** out of **** helpful•16 14 mattkratz Nov 13, 2020 Details Edit Release date November 5, 2020 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Official site Language English Also known as Будь позитивним Filming locations Warner Brothers Burbank Studios - 4000 Warner Boulevard, Burbank, California, USA Production companies Chuck Lorre Productions Warner Bros.
