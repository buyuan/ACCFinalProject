Connections Featured in ESPN College Football: Florida State Seminoles at Miami Hurricanes (2020) User reviews384 Review Top review 6/10 Everything is bad BUT....... Acting bad, writing bad, characters bad. Only thing that saved this show and had me watching is the story. It's pretty interesting and I want to know how it turns out. That's the only reason I'm sticking around. Oh and the main sheriff is pretty good though. He's the best actor in the whole show. helpful•26 20 cfoster-43794 Dec 3, 2020 Details Edit Release date November 17, 2020 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Nekonečná obloha Filming locations Squamish, British Columbia, Canada Production companies Fineman Entertainment David E.
