Personal Quote: [on producer Harvey Weinstein and his sexual harassment scandal] When people say 'everybody knew' - yeah, I knew he was an asshole. He was proud of that. That's how he carried himself. And I knew he was a womanizer. I wouldn't want to be married to the guy. But that's not my business.
