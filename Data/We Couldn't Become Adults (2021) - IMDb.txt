Every day I worked hard at the end of the video industry because I wanted to be recognized by her who hates "ordinary". In 1999, contrary to Nostradamus's great prophecy, the earth did not perish, and she, who was the only supporter of her heart, left without saying goodbye. And 2020. The 46-year-old, who has lived in harmony with society, remembers "then" when he never returned, triggered by some bittersweet reunions. friendmemorieslovelittlenetflix original15 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Drama Romance Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Add content advisory User reviews3 Review Top review 10/10 Life was not better This movie speaks to a lot of people in their adult years going through horrible work and trying to survive on a day-to-day basis in dead-end jobs and always thinking that they could be great if they ever had the time or resources to pursue their passion. We Couldn't Become Adults is an excellent film and, without spoiling anything, it is aimed at a certain audience. Its a slow film that has a nonlinear plot structure and is entirely about human emotions, what love means, and growing up. Its the kind of movie you have to watch at a certain point in life to get but when you do its really good and works as if it was based on you. If you're a jaded adult who wishes they could do something with their life, then watch the film. If not then watch it with that in mind. I really liked it! helpful•27 1 hasnad-31282 Nov 5, 2021 Details Edit Release date November 5, 2021 (Japan) Country of origin Japan Official sites Netflix Site Official Instagram site Language Japanese Also known as Chúng ta chẳng thể trưởng thành Filming locations Tokyo, Japan Production company C&I Entertainment See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 2 hours 4 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Related news Netflix Is Expanding its Appeal to Japanese Filmmakers, Says Sakamoto Kaata (Exclusive) Nov 11Variety Film + TV New On Netflix For November 2021: Day-By-Day Listings For TV Series, Movies & More Oct 26Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was We Couldn't Become Adults (2021) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
