Faced with unimaginable odds, she retreats to a fantastical world in her imagination where she and four other female asylum inmates plot to escape the facility. The line between reality and fantasy blurs as Babydoll and the others, plus a mysterious guide, fight to retrieve the five items that will let them break free from their captors in time. —Anonymous escapealternate realitysamuraiprostitutiongirl gang256 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Feed Your Head Genres Action Adventure Fantasy Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for thematic material involving sexuality, violence and combat sequences, and for language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Each of the lead girls had to undergo strict physical training which involved doing dead-lifts up to 96 kilograms several months before shooting. Vanessa Hudgens called that period "tormenting" and she broke down several times. In scenes where she's seen crying, she actually brought out moments from those sessions. Goofs In the dressing room when Sweet Pea, Rocket, and Blondie talk about not helping Babydoll, their movements don't match their mirror images; doubles are being used so the camera can move behind them without being reflected. - NOTE This is not a revealing mistake. In that scene, those mirrors are attached to the wall. There's no physical way the camera could have rotated around those mirrors. The director is doing this to alert the viewer they are inside another reality (baby dolls) Quotes Sweet Pea: And finally this question, the mystery of whose story it will be. Of who draws the curtain. Who is it that chooses our steps in the dance? Who drives us mad? Lashes us with whips and crowns us with victory when we survive the impossible? Who is it, that does all of these things? Sweet Pea: Who honors those we love for the very life we live? Who sends monsters to kill us, and at the same time sings that we will never die? Who teaches us what's real and how to laugh at lies? Who decides why we live and what we'll die to defend? Who chains us? And who holds the key that can set us free... It's you. You have all the weapons you need. Now fight! Crazy credits The Warner Bros and Legendary Pictures logos appear on a stage curtain, with the curtain rising to reveal each logo. A brief narrative precedes the Warner Bros logo appearing. Alternate versions There is an extended cut that is 18 minutes longer than the theatrical cut only available on Blu-ray.

The film has quite a bit of creativity that has been put into it. Watch. helpful•105 43 conaghernaoki Aug 23, 2019 FAQ11 What, exactly, is a "Sucker Punch"?
