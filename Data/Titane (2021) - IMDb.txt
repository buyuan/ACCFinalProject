One was an intriguing log line that's been kicking around for a while now: "Following a series of unexplained crimes, a father is reunited with the son who has been missing for 10 years." The other was more esoteric, a simple definition of the element titanium: "A metal highly resistant to heat and corrosion, with high tensile strength alloys." When the teaser trailer dropped a week before the festival, speculation was rife, with many drawing comparisons with the work of body horror maestro David Cronenberg.

Strange but very good and original film. Some gore that then gets an explanation and sense for the story. Kind of non binary non species movie.
