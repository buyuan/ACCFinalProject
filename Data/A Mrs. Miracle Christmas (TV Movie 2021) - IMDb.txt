Connections References Jeopardy! (1984) User reviews11 Review Top review 5/10 There are many better Hallmark movies I liked the previous Mrs. Miracle movie a lot better. I found the writing in this one totally cliche, dull, and certainly nothing original. It's as if they are writing by the numbers as many of these films are. The directing was sloppy at times and very pedestrian. No interesting directing style at all. Why can't Hallmark do something different for a change? helpful•6 8 marmar-93750 Nov 9, 2021 Details Edit Release date November 6, 2021 (United States) Countries of origin Canada United States Official site hallmarkmoviesandmysteries Languages English Hebrew Also known as Debbie Macomber's A Christmas Miracle Filming locations Victoria, British Columbia, Canada Production company Front Street Pictures See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 24 minutes Color Color Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was A Mrs. Miracle Christmas (2021) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
