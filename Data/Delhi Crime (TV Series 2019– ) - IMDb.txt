User reviews226 Review Top review 10/10 Will make you angry and overwhelmed at the same time I was very angry and overwhelmed at the same time when watching this. It's an amazing take on the real heinous act of inhuman treatment and ghastly Ugly reality of our so called society which holds their values to the core but don't know how to act on them. My guts were trolling when this happened and again when i was watching this. I really hope that such demonic creatures never come into existence and the accused get the justice they deserve asap. helpful•56 11 abhimanyusarin Mar 23, 2019 FAQ1 Will there be a season 2?
