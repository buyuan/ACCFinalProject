Soundtracks You're Cold Performed by Heize User reviews563 Review Top review 10/10 Unique and powerful This drama is very different from your typical kdrama. It addresses the sensitive topic of mental health and it has me completely hooked after watching only the first few episodes. The actors have great chemistry; their charisma is insane. I really enjoyed the animations that were incorporated into the film. I highly recommend everyone to try experiencing this great drama for themselves because it will surely not disappoint. helpful•128 11 bpemkvqq Jul 2, 2020 Details Edit Release date June 20, 2020 (South Korea) Country of origin South Korea Official sites Netflix Official Site (South Korea) Language Korean Also known as It's Okay to Not Be Okay Production companies Studio Dragon Story TV Gold Medalist See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 20 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Related news International Emmy Awards Nominations: ‘Call My Agent’ & David Tennant Among Those Up For Prizes Sep 23Deadline Film + TV The Best Korean Dramas on Netflix to Watch Right Now Jul 24Den of Geek Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
