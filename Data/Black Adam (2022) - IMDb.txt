Quotes Black Adam: Five thousand years ago, Kahndaq was a melting pot of cultures, wealth, power and magic. But most of us had nothing, except for the chains around our necks. Kahndaq needed a hero... instead, they got me. I did what needed to be done, and they imprisoned me for it. Now, five thousand years later, I am free. And I give you my word: no one will ever stop me again.
