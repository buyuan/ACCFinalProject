The audience actively participates in Steve's daily routine and helps solve everyday problems, all within a context of entertaining games and activities. Blue's Clues is designed to develop preschoolers' thinking, reasoning and social skills through an educational approach called "flexible thinking," a theory that recognizes that children need to learn, not just what to think, but how to think for themselves. Blue's Clues uses a play-along format, which encourages kids to actively participate in using the clues as they view the program. —Hotlink cluedogbreaking the fourth wallpreschoolpuppetry14 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines To empower, challenge and build the self-esteem of preschoolers...all while making them laugh! Genres Animation Comedy Family Musical Certificate TV-Y Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia In 1998, rumors started circulating that former host Steve Burns had died following drug-related problems. The rumor became so serious that Burns appeared on The Rosie O'Donnell Show (1996) to reassure his young audience that he was alive and well. Crazy credits Blue's Safari VHS: After the end credits, the Nick Jr. 90's Productions logo appears which is never used in the series. After that logo, the Nickelodeon flower logo appears Alternate versions As the series became popular worldwide, localized versions of the series were produced, either overdubbing Steve or Joe, or replaced by a completely new host. Connections Edited into Blue's Birthday (1998) Soundtracks Blue's Clues Theme Song Performed by Donovan Patton User reviews37 Review Top review A Perfect Recipe Take an adorable twenty-something guy, a computer animated blue puppy, add a dash of spices (Mr. Salt, Mrs. Pepper and Paprika to be specific), throw in your favorite preschooler and you have the perfect recipe for a delightful Nick Jr show. "Blue's Clues," and the format in which it is shown, are simply ingenious. In the show, Steve (the adorable twenty-something guy I mentioned earlier) is the only live action character in an animated world. Every episode, his dog, Blue, has something that she wants to tell Steve, and in order to do this, she goes around the house leaving blue paw prints on clues. While trying to find the clues, Steve often stops to help his friends (Slippery Soap, Mr. Salt, Mrs. Pepper, Paprika, Shovel and Pail, the Felt Friends and various others) with some dilemma they may be having (shapes, colors, what doesn't belong, etc). At the end of the show, Steve asks the children's help to figure out what Blue is trying to tell him. There are various songs that remain the same from episode to episode. The songs are simple enough for the child that I babysit to sing and dance along with. Each week, the same episode of `Blue's Clues' is shown for five days. The thought process behind this is that the more times a child sees something, the more they pick up from it and the better that they feel about themselves for having learned something. I have seen this plan succeed. On Monday, the four-year-old that I baby-sit asks me what the answers are. I dumb myself down as Steve does on the show in order for the little boy to learn the answers. On Tuesday, he's a little more vocal because he learned some things the day before. On Wednesday, he's interacting with Steve and Blue for a good portion of show. By Thursday, he has everything figured out and answers them easily. On Friday, he's a pro at it and answers the questions before Steve can even get them out of his mouth. `Blue's Clues' is a pleasant and welcome change from other television shows. It is totally interactive and because Steve relies on the kids help to figure things out, it makes them feel like good. Not to mention, it's 25 straight minutes where I don't have to worry about what the child is watching because I feel safe letting him watch "Blue's Clues". helpful•13 0 Movie_Fan Apr 12, 2000 Details Edit Release date September 8, 1996 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Nick Jr. PBS Kids Language English Also known as Blue's Prints Filming locations New York City, New York, USA Production companies Nick Jr. Productions Nickelodeon Animation Studios See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 25 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 1.33 : 1 1.78 : 1 Related news Blue's Clues Star Steve Burns Just Joined TikTok--and He's a Little Confused Nov 17E!
