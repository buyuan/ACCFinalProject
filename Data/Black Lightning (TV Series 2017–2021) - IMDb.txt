He hung up the suit and his secret identity years ago, but with a daughter hell-bent on justice and a star student being recruited by a local gang, he'll be pulled back into the fight as the wanted vigilante and DC legend: Black Lightning. black lightning charactersuperheroelectricityafrican americanmetahuman40 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines He chose family... every choice has a cost. (season 1) Genres Action Drama Sci-Fi Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Originally developed for Fox, however the network executives decided not to exercise the "option" and passed on the series. Goofs The experiments that gave Black Lightning his powers, which he subsequently passed on to his daughters, apparently came by altering his mitochondria. Mitochondria are inherited exclusively from one's mother, so he shouldn't have been able to do so. Crazy credits The Warner Bros and DC Comics logos are charged with lightning. Connections Featured in The Chronic Rift: Some Things to Think About (2018) User reviews415 Review Top review 6/10 Just keeps getting better EDIT: RARE that a series takes feedback and fixes everything that's wrong, but Black Lightening did that. I truly love this show now and hope it keeps going Edit #2: spoke too soon. Once again the writers lost their way. I honestly feel this show had major potential to deliver on its... potential, not just as a beacon for social and racial justice, but also as a truly high quality superhero show. The actors did their absolute best with what they were given, and some shone brightly despite the writing, but sadly the formula for all these DC shows (Cheese + camp + cringe) remains a work in progress. Original: Good premise and potential, and some good acting and special effects. Conversely, the massive cheese factor in the writing combined with some equally bad acting, make it impossible to really get involved in the show. helpful•77 37 worksmart-58506 Oct 18, 2018 Details Edit Release date January 16, 2018 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Official Facebook Official Site Language English Also known as 黑閃電 Filming locations Atlanta, Georgia, USA Production companies Berlanti Productions DC Entertainment Warner Bros.
