Connections References The Muppet Show (1976) User reviews1 Review Top review 9/10 Megyn Price WOW Plot In A Paragraph: Audrey is accused of sexual harassment after trying to make UP with a mail room employee, who she turned down for a promotion. Adam tries to give Jennifer a massage that doesn't lead to sex, and after Jeff mocks a cricket video game Timmy has sent, He challenges him a to beat him in a game. When he easily beats him, Jeff insists it's because it's a silly computer game so Timmy challenges Jeff to a real game of cricket. Megyn Price WOW.WOW.WOW!! OH MY GOD!! THAT scene where her dress gets caught in the elevator was fantastic showcasing her fantastic legs and body... its safe to say that is burned in my mind. Adhir Kalyan and Patrick Warburton are a lot of fun in this episode, but it seemed like the Adam and Jen storyline was filler!! are the writers running out of ideas for these two?? helpful•3 1 slightlymad22 Nov 28, 2014 Details Edit Release date May 17, 2010 (United States) Language English Filming locations Sony Pictures Studios - 10202 W.
