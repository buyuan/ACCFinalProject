Many movies have shot in the Bradbury, with the most famous being Blade Runner (1982). One of the rules that the production crew had to follow when working in the Bradbury was that no food or drink was permitted on set. Goofs Murphy and Arabella leave Murphy's friend's cabin (right before he's murdered by Joan Freeman) and that very evening, Arabella sees a newspaper with the heading "Escaped Cop Kills Again". The newspaper even writes that Arabella is his accomplice. However, there's no reason for the police to assume that the murderer was Murphy. Joan Freeman shoots the victim with his own rifle, not Murphy's gun. Moreover, it's highly implausible that the police could even know about a murder in a very remote cabin in the woods, make inquiries and somehow mark Murphy as a suspect, and get the story into the evening papers, all in the space of a few hours. Quotes Jack Murphy: The only law I know is "Jack Murphy's law." It's very simple. Don't *fuck* with Jack Murphy. You remember that.

It's got a stronger and different Charles Bronson performance in it as he plays a cop who's one of several targets on an insane woman's hit list as she seeks vengeance after getting out of jail. In addition to the good Bronson performance, I thought the female killer (Carrie Snodgress) was a welcome addition and was a fairly formidable villainess. The big problem in the film is the repetitive and childish "potty-mouth" name calling by the annoying Kathleen Wilhoite; it's not funny especially after a couple dozen times, nor are the names especially creative. She plays a young car thief who gets mixed up with Bronson and comes close to spoiling the movie; thankfully there is still enough action going on that I'm willing to ignore her and call this a good film of its type. *** out of **** helpful•8 1 JoeKarlosi Jun 21, 2008 Details Edit Release date April 18, 1986 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Murphys Gesetz Filming locations Bradbury Building - 304 S.
