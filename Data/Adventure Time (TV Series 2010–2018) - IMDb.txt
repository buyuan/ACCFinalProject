Quotes Finn: What time is it? Adventure Time! Crazy credits Some episodes have different versions of the opening theme. In the Fiona & Cake episodes, it is a gender swapped version of the regular intro with a woman singing the theme song. The episode A Glitch Is a Glitch, the opening is CG animated. In Food Chain, the opening has all the characters with Finn and Jake's faces and the theme song is sung by a different singer as well. Alternate versions Episodes shown many countries (particularly UK and Australia) have contain many of the more vulgar and sensitive scenes edited out. In fact, some of the more vulgar and violent episodes have never aired in some countries as well. Adventure Time also received censorship in countries like Brazil, Latin America, Spain, Turkey, Portugal, Philippines, India, Canada and Japan. However, DVDs and some syndicated airings are uncut. Connections Edited into The Frollo Show: Frollo Faps to a Firefighters calendar (2011) Soundtracks Adventure Time (Main Title Theme) Performed by Pendleton Ward User reviews203 Review Top review 10/10 One of the best things on TV at the moment I first saw Adventure Time on youtube some years ago. Now it's TV show. I loved it when it was a one-shot video. And I love each episode I've seen on Cartoon Network even more. Yes, the characters are silly. Yes, there is a fair amount of "OMG, that's so random!" going on. But while shows like Chowder may fail at times using this model, Adventure Time succeeds. It does so thanks to wonderful voice acting, clever dialog and most of all, unusually mature themes. Not in a risqué sense, but...it doesn't rely on cookie cutter stories and it's comfortable leaving some endings ambiguous. It's also comfortable making characters believable (despite its fantasy setting). This show is deserves attention. helpful•178 33 poke_a_polk Apr 25, 2010 FAQ4 Which one is Finn and which one is Jake? Who are Finn and Jake? When does Adventure Time take place?
