(1988) User reviews42 Review Top review 6/10 Not nearly as Good as Original First off, the new host (Aisha Tyler) isn't funny, especially after what Drew Carey gave to this show. She does not come close at all to Drew. This is the main reason this show is just okay. The chemistry that they had with Drew, the jokes they made towards Drew And visa-versa will never be the same, and that was one of the funniest parts about the original US version. When Drew carey starts the show by saying "The points don't matter, just like (blank)" it starts the show off on a great, funny note. There is definitely a huge gaping hole of unfunny and boringness in this show because of her, and they could have gotten a much better host! Ryan, Colin and Wayne are still very funny, and are the only reason this show is worth watching! They aren't as quick as they used to be, but they are still Laugh out Loud funny! The "guests" they have on are very gimmicky not that funny, just sort of awkward to watch. It adds nothing, it just wastes time. I would give this show 6.5/10 the host really brings down the show, but how do you not love Colin, Ryan and Wayne! Worth the watch, but don't expect the same level of funniness the original US version had. helpful•14 13 ebrettster Jul 17, 2013 Details Edit Release date July 16, 2013 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as W.L.I.I.A.?
