Ms. Thompson thinks it's funny that in all seven movies, they've never spoken directly to each other. User reviews25 Review Top review 8/10 Back to the Future There's little doubt the writers were conjuring up memories of Back to the Future since not only are there two of the stars from that movie, but the partially disappearing ticket was central to determining if Angie had succeeded in her quest. This movie is clever in the use of those elements while putting them in a Christmas setting. One almost expects the conductor to call out to Marty. This movie isn't focused on one central romance, although Angie's future love life is one of the threads. Angie is also hard at work on her family relationships, especially her sister and her parents, the latter evoking even stronger similarities with BttF. Because Angie's own romance is only part of the focus of the movie, Fonseca's chemistry with her romantic opposites is not as much a factor is we usually expect, but she does have great interplay with Chandler Massey. Fonseca, and for that matter all the cast, provide good acting. The dialogue is fun and plays well to the situations that crop up. Christopher Lloyd is great as usual and Lea Thompson impresses me more in this movie than in BttF. While the redo element of the plot is not unusual for a Christmas movie, this movie still stands out as clever and creative in story, acting and dialogue. helpful•15 1 Jackbv123 Nov 7, 2021 Details Edit Release date November 6, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Network Website Language English Also known as Next Stop, Christmas Filming locations Essex, Connecticut, USA Production company Synthetic Cinema International See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 24 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news Tina Lifford Previews the ‘Queen Sugar’ Finale & Hallmark’s ‘A Holiday in Harlem’ Nov 12TV Insider 2021 Holiday Movies, Shows On TV & Streaming For November & December – Updated Schedule Nov 11Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Spanish language plot outline for A Holiday in Harlem (2021)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
