Clay Mathematics Institute offered a USD $1,000,000 prize to the first person providing a solution for a specific statement of the problem. Goofs When Mary looks at Grandmother's photo album, there is a photo of a college gateway. Grandmother responds to Mary's question "where is that?", stating "Cambridge". In fact it is the gateway to Christ Church, Oxford University, with Mercury, the statue in central fountain, clearly visible in the background. Quotes Mary Adler: He's a good person. He wanted me before I was smart. Connections Featured in Chris Stuckmann Movie Reviews: Gifted (2017) Soundtracks Gifted Intro Written and Performed by Seth Avett (as Timothy Seth Avett) Timothy Seth Avett Performs Courtesy of American Recordings User reviews297 Review Top review I will recommend it to everyone This film tells the story of a seven year old girl who is spectacularly gifted at mathematics. She becomes the centre of a custody lawsuit, when her grandmother shows up out of the blue and demands custody from her uncle. "Gifted" is brilliant in so many ways. The story itself is very touching and engaging. Mary is super clever, but she still has a childish side to her. She is very adorable, and I simply wish all the best for her. Her uncle is charming, and does everything he can to take care of Mary. The legal battle with the grandmother is captivating, and it is enhanced by the fact that the two parties are in fact blood relatives with a heartbreaking history. As the heartbreak slowly unfolds, my heart breaks a little more, and I feel closer to the story even more. I really liked "Gifted". I will recommend it to all my friends. helpful•38 17 Gordon-11 May 22, 2017 Details Edit Release date April 12, 2017 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Official site Official site (Japan) Language English Also known as Cô Bé Thần Đồng Filming locations Savannah, Georgia, USA Production companies Dayday Films FilmNation Entertainment Fox Searchlight Pictures See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $7,000,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $24,801,212 Opening weekend US & Canada $446,380 Apr 9, 2017 Gross worldwide $43,069,254 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 41 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 2.39 : 1 Related news Hightown Season 2 Trailer Teases Darkness, Redemption, & More!
