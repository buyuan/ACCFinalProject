Quotes Mark: What's with the gun? It doesn't suit you. Soundtracks The Ballad Of The Blue Iguana Written by Tom Tunney Performed by Tom Tunney and Brendan Gill User reviews46 Review Top review 8/10 "Thats my pen" killer lines, killer movie This little obscure independent British movie couldn't have been written, directed and acted any better. I think it's going to be a classic movie in the coming years. Since last week I've probably watched it about half a dozen times, including even today. It's simplicity, it's honesty regarding reality make it the exception to many fantasy revenge movies. Real life could easily play out like this movie presents and this none more seen then when he shoots the first Villain, there's a dialogue interplay which ends with he line " That's my pen" now I'm not going to spoil it for you but this line exemplifies the whole film for me, check it out and you'll se what I am referring to. The logic behind Harry's actions makes sense to loners who have the time without life's distractions to think things through to their final bloody conclusion. An excellent movie in my book, real in every sense of revenge, feats your eyes and Bon Appetit! helpful•33 1 dillangreengrass Nov 1, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 8, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United Kingdom Language English Also known as Don't Leave Me Filming locations London, England, UK Production company UK Film Studio Pictures See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 19 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news State of the Festival: Paradoxes of Scale — TIFF 2021 Oct 13MUBI ‘Drive My Car’, ‘A Hero’ lead nominations for Asia Pacific Screen Academy awards Oct 13ScreenDaily Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Vengeance Is Mine (2021) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
