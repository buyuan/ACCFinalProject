When his brother Tanner Howard is released from the prison, they team up to rob agencies of the Texas Midlands Bank to raise money to pay the loan so that Toby may leave the real estate to his sons.

Genres Action Crime Drama Thriller Western Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for some strong violence, language throughout and brief sexuality Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The phrase "come hell or high water" typically means "do whatever needs to be done, no matter the circumstances". It also refers to the "hell or high water clause" in a contract, usually a lease, which states that the payments must continue regardless of any difficulties the paying party may encounter. Both definitions apply to different parts of the plot in this movie. Goofs In the final scene, Marcus parks his car a ways from the house and walks up, with Toby meeting him at his fence line. Marcus asks is he can sit, and then walks up to the house. When he leaves, his car is in the driveway, right in front of the house. Quotes Toby Howard: I've been poor my whole life, like a disease passing from generation to generation. But not my boys, not anymore. Connections Featured in The Late Late Show with James Corden: David Duchovny/Jeff Bridges/Nastasya Generalova (2016) Soundtracks Dollar Bill Blues Written & Performed by Townes van Zandt (as Townes Van Zandt) Courtesy of RCA Records Nashville By Arrangement with Sony Music Licensing User reviews482 Review Top review Excellently-written and acted This is definitely the type of simple film that many might dismiss when first hearing about it or seeing the promotional footage of it. What's really surprising about it is the amount of emotional and dramatic weight that it carries. It's not primarily interested in gun fights or car chases. Instead, it's interested in exploring the dynamics of race and culture, and in depicting everyone as flawed individuals who you still feel empathy for. It gives you a portrayal of what poverty and the economy can do, even when never attempting to justify the horrible behavior on display or trying to make excuses for its characters. It's filled with wonderful, thoughtful dialogue while also playing out like a realistic morality tale. The three leads are also fantastic, especially Ben Foster, who deserves to get more roles as the talented character-actor he is. This is highly recommended. helpful•116 27 Red_Identity Aug 20, 2016 FAQ1 Who are the Mackenzies that the film is dedicated to and why?
