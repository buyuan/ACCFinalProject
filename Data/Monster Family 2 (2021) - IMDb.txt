If I remember correctly another movie was supposed to come out exactly close to this time of the year before it got pushed to next year. Also the theme of that movie was monsters turning into humans and this movie is about humans turning into monsters... also the source of the transformation is basically advanced crazy science mixed with magic green gems. It just feels like this fish out of water story is a bit used in movies these days. And that every movie is basically the same movie mixed with surface level differences. And this movie? Well you can either watch this movie or Hotel Transylvania 4... you choose... it's all just the same formula... helpful•0 0 julianmarku Nov 6, 2021 Details Edit Release date November 4, 2021 (Germany) Countries of origin Germany United Kingdom Official sites Official site official site (uk) Languages English German Also known as Monsterfamiljen - Ingen är perfekt Production companies Ambient Entertainment GmbH Rothkirch Cartoon Film Timeless Films See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross US & Canada $76,417 Opening weekend US & Canada $57,501 Oct 17, 2021 Gross worldwide $1,747,049 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 43 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 2.39 : 1 Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the English language plot outline for Monster Family 2 (2021)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
