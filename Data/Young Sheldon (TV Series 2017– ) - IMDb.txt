As he struggles to be understood by his family, classmates, and neighbors, his mother arms him with the best tool she: reminding bullies that his dad is the football coach and his brother is on the team. His twin sister doesn't share his exceptional mind, but she has a much clearer vision of what life has in store for the young genius. Jim Parsons, who plays the adult version of Sheldon on The Big Bang Theory (2007), narrates. child prodigyprequelspin offtexasbrilliant mind9 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genre Comedy Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Zoe Perry is the real-life daughter of Laurie Metcalf from The Big Bang Theory (2007). Over 20 years earlier she also played the younger version of her mother in episodes 5.7, Halloween IV (1992) and 7.19, All About Rosey (1995) of Roseanne (1988). Now she again plays a younger version of her mother's character over 20 years later. Goofs The Cooper's garage is a stand-alone structure that opens up onto the cross street of the corner where they live, but no vehicle is ever seen inside it. And none of the exterior shots of the house show Mary, George, or eventually Georgie's cars and trucks parked outside either.

That said, i have to mention other reviews that tells me more about people these days. So, basic human reaction according to these people on IMDb commenting this show is when you see someone smarter than you, is to kick him, shut him up, make him stop, tell him he is weird, etc. It scares them and makes them angry at the same time, even though it's an imaginary kid on a TV show.
