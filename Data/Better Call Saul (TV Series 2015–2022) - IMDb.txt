And if you're calling Jimmy, you're in real trouble. The prequel to "Breaking Bad" follows small-time attorney Jimmy McGill as he transforms into Walter White's morally challenged lawyer, Saul Goodman. —zaahir1604 prequelspin offfinancial struggleshared universecharacter flaw55 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Make the call Genres Crime Drama Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The series takes place in 2002, six years before the beginning of Breaking Bad (2008) and seven years before Saul's first appearance. Goofs Mike Ehrmentraut's granddaughter Kaylee is clearly the same age as she will be during the run of Breaking Bad. SInce Better Call Saul is a prequel to that series, this should not be the case.

Connections Featured in Conan: Adam Sandler/Jonathan Banks/Broods (2015) User reviews933 Review Top review 10/10 extremely underrated This show deserves more recognition. Better Call Saul is the most clever show I have ever watched. The acting, cinematography, the story, the writing, it's amazing. Some times even better than Breaking Bad. helpful•432 67 onnodewettinck Dec 14, 2019 FAQ6 What does Chuck suffer from? What "Breaking Bad" Easter eggs are in "Better Call Saul"?
