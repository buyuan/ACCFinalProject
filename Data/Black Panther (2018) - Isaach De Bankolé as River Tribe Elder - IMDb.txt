Erik Killmonger : [in Xhosa] I am N'Jadaka, son of Prince N'Jobu! Mining Tribe Elder : [in Xhosa] Son of N'Jobu? Erik Killmonger : I found my daddy with Panther claws in his chest! You ain't the son of a king. You're the son of a murderer! Ramonda : [in Xhosa] You're lying! [in English] Ramonda : Lies! W'Kabi : I'm afraid not, Queen Mother.
