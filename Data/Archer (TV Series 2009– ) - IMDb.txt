At the center of it all is suave master spy Sterling Archer, whose less-than-masculine code name is "Duchess." Archer works with his domineering mother Malory, who also is his boss. He also has to deal with his ex-girlfriend, Agent Lana Kane and her new boyfriend, comptroller Cyril Figgis, as well as Malory's lovesick secretary, Cheryl. —Anonymous adult animationspyespionageviolencedomineering mother36 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Espionage never tasted so salty. (season 1) Genres Animation Action Comedy Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Magazines that characters read are often references to later episodes or plotlines for upcoming episodes in the season. Goofs In "El Secuestro" (Season 2), Brett's voice match on the call with the kidnappers shows his full name as "Brett Buckley." In "White Elephant"(Season 5), Brett's last name is stated by the FBI as "Bunson," causing Archer to remember the Muppet character Bunsen Honeydew. Quotes [repeated lines] Sterling Archer: Lana!

Having just seen the special sneak preview of 'ARCHER' on the FX network, I have to say that this was possibly the most entertaining, most ribald, most disturbing and just plain hysterical thirty minutes of television I have ever seen. Think 'Venture Brothers' meets James Bond meets a truck load of self-obsessed heroine addicts and you'll begin to get an idea of what awaits us all in January when this series comes to the masses in prime time. Fans of H. Jon Benjamin will love him as he brings his own dead pan cadence to Sterling Archer, a character that is arguably the most narcissistic is television history. The writing is quick and sharp, the animation is stylized and hip and the laughs come faster than you can catch them. In short, watch for this amazing show to come to your TV in January and prepare to be amazed. Seriously, watch this show! helpful•200 46 dkbengel Sep 17, 2009 FAQ1 What year does Archer take place in?
