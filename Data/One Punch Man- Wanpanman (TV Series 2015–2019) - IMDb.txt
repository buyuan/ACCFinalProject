But being just one hero in a world filled with them, his life is empty and hollow: he gets no respect from anyone, he displays a laidback attitude to everything and for the most part, he finds his overall hero life pointless... and worst of all, he lost his hair due to intense training. These are the adventures of an ordinary yet extraordinary hero. animesuperheroparodysatiredepression8 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Animation Action Comedy Fantasy Sci-Fi Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The character design of Saitama is based on the gag anime superhero Anpanman from Soreike!

Connections Featured in DBX: Saitama VS Kenshiro (One Punch Man VS Fist of the North Star) (2016) User reviews326 Review Top review 10/10 One Punch Man a must watch This anime which has released a few weeks ago is a masterpiece created by renown anime producer, Madhouse. It sat ires classical anime genre making it an extremely hilarious show which will bring many grins to those who have already watch other anime. Perhaps the most notable accomplishment of this anime so far is the main hero Saitama who through his plain bald appearance makes us rejoice as he reveals tiny fractions of his power against formidable foes. Combine this with an epic soundtrack, amazingly drawn fight scenes and the badassery that it Saitama you get yourself an awesome anime. helpful•153 23 lucasdenomme Oct 19, 2015 Details Edit Release date October 1, 2015 (Japan) Country of origin Japan Official site Official site Languages Japanese English Also known as One Punch Man Filming locations Tokyo, Japan Production companies Asatsu Bandai Namco Arts Bandai Spirits See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 24 minutes Color Color Sound mix DTS-Stereo Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news One-Punch Man: The S-Class Heroes, Ranked By Power Aug 11ScreenRant.com Anime Review: One Punch Man (2015) by Shingo Natsume Jul 26AsianMoviePulse Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
