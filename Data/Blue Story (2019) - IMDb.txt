Timmy, a shy, smart, naive and timid young boy from Deptford, goes to school in Peckham where he strikes up a friendship with Marco, a charismatic, streetwise kid from the local area. Although from warring postcodes, the two quickly form a firm friendship until it is tested and they wind up on rival sides of a street war. Blue Story depicts elements of Rapman's own personal experiences and aspects of his childhood. —ROC Nation london englandgang violencegangshootingstabbing9 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Their Bond Made Them Brothers. The Streets Made Them Enemies. Genres Crime Drama Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for violence and language throughout, drug use and some sexuality Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia During its UK opening weekend a riot occurred at a VUE cinema in Birmingham, England, in the middle of a screening (speculation as to whether it was Blue Story (2019) or Frozen II (2019)). Over 100 people were allegedly involved, including young teenagers armed with machetes. The area was put under lock-down by police armed with tasers. As a result of the riot, VUE (and later Showcase Cinemas) decided to cancel all screenings of Blue Story and blame the violence on the film and the film's message. Further incidents also occurred during opening night, including a machete attack in Huddersfield. Connections Featured in Good Morning Britain: Episode dated 25 November 2019 (2019) Soundtracks The Real Blue Story Written by Rapman Performed by Rapman User reviews123 Review Top review 6/10 Powerful story, not so well executed This film was alright at best. I try to overlook the budget which made the writing and acting quite poor. The film portrays a quite powerful story but it just didn't really execute it so well into cinematography. It was pretty interesting to see nonetheless and I wouldn't call this film terrible or something. helpful•8 5 Timbo_Watching Mar 14, 2020 Details Edit Release date November 22, 2019 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Language English Also known as Câu Chuyện Buồn Filming locations Peckham, London, UK Production companies BBC Films DJ Films Joi Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget £1,300,000 (estimated) Gross worldwide $5,881,391 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 31 minutes Color Color Related news Sky Studios & Dbk Studios Team For ‘Unearthed Narratives’ On Sky Arts; Short Film Series Will Celebrate Diverse UK Talent Oct 13Deadline Film + TV Teaser trailer drops for Reggie Yates feature ‘Pirates’ Aug 18HeyUGuys.co.uk Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Japanese language plot outline for Blue Story (2019)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
