He falls in love with Geeta at first sight. He proposes to her in front of her boyfriend Siva. She bluntly refuses. The theme of the film is Arya's philosophy in life--one way love. While he keeps extolling and spreading the virtues of his philosophy, he also teases Geeta's boyfriend at every available opportunity about why he should fee threatened by Arya's one-sided attempts to woo the uninterested Geeta, if Siva so strongly believes in the bond of true love between them. What follows is a comic roller coaster. The rest of the film is all about how Arya wins Geeta with his positive outlook. —wlcooper character name as titleone word titlelovepeer pressurestones9 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Action Drama Romance Certificate Not Rated Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia Arya is Sukumar's ( Director) first film which shown acting skills in Allu Arjun and stood out as altimeter favourite movie and character for all Allu Arjun fans.
