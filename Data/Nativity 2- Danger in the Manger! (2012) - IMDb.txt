Connections Featured in Projector: Nativity 2: Danger in the Manger! (2012) Soundtracks Rehab (uncredited) Written by Amy Winehouse User reviews38 Review Top review 9/10 Ignore the bah humbugs! There are many out there who have no sense of fun anymore and have hammered this film. The truth is it's not an Oscar winner but it's fun. We sat in a packed cinema screen of all ages who laughed their way through with a few tears in places and afterwards left feeling good. That's what this film does and all those who have seen it I know say the same - yes it's silly and childish - but it's meant to be! Ignore the so called film experts - we can all call ourselves that and justify it in some way - and just enjoy it for what it is, a simple film which doesn't take itself seriously with a great message running through it. helpful•26 12 Skellons2-211-170992 Nov 7, 2013 Details Edit Release date November 23, 2012 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Language English Also known as Nativity! 2 Filming locations Pistyll Rhaeadr Waterfall, Llanrhaeadr ym Mochnant, Powys, Wales, UK Production companies Media Pro Six Mirrorball Films Moviehouse Entertainment See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget £3,000,000 (estimated) Gross worldwide $14,433,981 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 45 minutes Color Color Related news A stable start for Nativity 2: Danger in the Manger!
