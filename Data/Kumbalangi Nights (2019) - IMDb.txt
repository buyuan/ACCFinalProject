Connections References Two Countries (2015) Soundtracks Cherathukal Vocals by Sithara Krishnakumar & Sushin Shyam Lyrics by Anvar Ali Composed by Sushin Shyam User reviews171 Review Top review 8/10 Golden run of Malayalam new wave is still alive and kicking Reducing Kumbalangi Nights to a drama film with some comic elements would be gross injustice.This is high art and one more proud moment for Malayalam cinema, which is on a new high with the advent of a bunch of highly talented young movie makers and technicians who honestly loves the art of visual story telling.If ordinary is something invisible, the writer director duo of KN are Gods because they have created something never seen before from things and incidents we see,hear and dismiss or forget every day.The stories protagonists are our friends or friends of our friends.There are brother s who fight and lovers who can't unite.There is a bad guy with whom every one in the theater would fall in love.Photographed by someone who loves his job, KN is a visual treat.. name's shyju Khalid.Sushin Shyam gives a score that adds to the visual splendour. Actors simply lived their part..every one of them.Shyam Pushkaran keeps on writing and tirelessly mesmerizes.
