CAROLINE CHRISTMAS-HOPE is a control freak, who desires nothing more than a perfect Christmas to atone for the fact that their father, JAMES, abandoned the whole family on Christmas Day, many years ago. JOANNA CHRISTMAS is a fashion editor, who likes expensive clothes almost as much as she hates the countryside and children. She has brought along her new city boy lover, FELIX for the festivities. VICKY CHRISTMAS is a man eater who changes boyfriends as often as most people change their underwear. PAULINA CHRISTMAS is an introverted music professor who has been writing her PhD thesis on The Beatles for a decade. Also along for the festive rollercoaster ride is their butter-wouldn't-melt mother, ELIZABETH CHRISTMAS; their plain-speaking farmer uncle, JOHN CHRISTMAS; Caroline's long-suffering husband, PETER; and their two children: prepubescent DAISY (12), and chocolate-smothered HENRY (7). The arrival of JAMES, their long-lost father, and his 35-year-old American girlfriend JACKIE ruins Caroline's hope for the perfect Christmas and sets off a series of mishaps, inconveniences and misconstrued misunderstandings that uncover the long-buried secret that tore their family apart, so many years ago. christmasfatherholidaymansionnetflix original Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines And You Think Your Family is a Mess??

[Caroline squeaks] Connections Featured in Sky News Tonight: Episode dated 17 September 2020 (2020) Soundtracks Jingle Bells Traditional Arranged by Dom Sky and Jack Rose Performed by Govardo Licensed courtesy of MSR Music Limited Published by MSR Music Limited, administered by Paleblue Limited User reviews72 Review Top review 5/10 Campy more than Funny The opening credits with the garish lighting and cheesy smiling mugs of the lead cast should have been a tip off... This Christmas comedy is very campy and silly, but without actual great punchlines or clever/witty dialogue. Kids might like it more than adults. Production value also feels more like a TV movie than a movie-movie. If you make it all the way through, ending is kind of cute. helpful•5 0 mycannonball Nov 9, 2021 Details Edit Release date November 7, 2021 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Official sites Netflix Site Official Facebook Page Language English Also known as Ông già Noel trở lại Filming locations York, North Yorkshire, England, UK Production company MSR Media See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 45 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Related news ‘Red Notice’ Seizes Biggest Netflix Movie Opening Weekend Ever; Italian Pic ‘Yara’ Tops Streamer’s New Weekly Charts Nov 16Deadline Film + TV ‘Father Christmas is Back’ Review (Netflix) Nov 11Nerdly Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What was the official certification given to Father Christmas Is Back (2021) in Germany?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
