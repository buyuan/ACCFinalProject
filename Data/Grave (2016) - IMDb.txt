As she leaves the family home, Justine abruptly moves into a mad new world of strange school traditions and vicious initiation tests, and before long, she will have to chew over her unshakable herbivorous beliefs. More and more, as Justine descends deeper and deeper into a hidden world of uncharted animalistic tendencies, an unprecedented and equally morbid craving for meat will transform her into something she would have never expected. However, now that Justine's corporeal awakening is finally complete, is there a point in denying her hunger for raw flesh? —Nick Riganas cannibalisminitiation ritesister sister relationshipeating raw meatveterinary student174 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines What are you hungry for? Genres Drama Horror Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for aberrant behavior, bloody and grisly images, strong sexuality, nudity, language and drug use/partying Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The raw chicken that Justine is eating out of the fridge is actually sugar. Garance Marillier said about the scene that while it didn't disgust her from chicken, it did disgust her from candies for life. Goofs In the end it is revealed that Justine's mother has the same cannibalistic tendencies as her and that her parents wanted to protect Justine by raising her as a vegetarian. However, her parents also sent her to the school where they went and knew the initiation required her to eat meat. Quotes Le père: Your mum was tough at first. Kept saying I was her best friend at school. It drove me nuts! It's not like she had a boyfriend. Just me. And then we had our first kiss. And I understood... Connections Featured in WatchMojo: Top 10 Cannibals in Scary Movies (2017) Soundtracks Despair, Hangover & Ecstasy Written by Olivia Merilahti, Dan Levy Performed by The Dø © Siamese Squids / BMG Rights Management (France) (p) 2014 Get Down! Under Exclusive License to Cinq 7 / Wagram Music With the kind permission of BMG Rights Management (France) User reviews265 Review Top review 7/10 Needs more than Cannibalism Its easy to understand the pull of the full. You want to watch a film about a girl who becomes a cannibal.. the film is very well crafted and full of interesting images. The acting is very good and the camera work solid. But somewhere during the film you begin to question the purpose of this film- it is neither full-blown horror nor is it a deep character study of a girl who is grappling with the cannibal inside her.
