Kajal Aggarwal and Priya Anand were signed on to portray the lead actresses, while Manush Nandan and Anirudh Ravichander were approached to be the film's cinematographer and compose the film's music, respectively.The project was titled as Marma Manithan and was reported to begin shooting in Malaysia from June 2015. Instead, production disputes took place during June 2015 after Ayngaran International also announced their interest in producing the film, with Thanu attempting to hand over the rights of the film. Priya Anand also opted out of the film, with Bindu Madhavi announced as her replacement. The ongoing changes subsequently stopped the team beginning their shoot in Malaysia during July 2015 and the production was stalled. The delays meant that Vikram stopped waiting for the makers to begin work, changed his specially-prepared facial hair and went back to add finishing touches to his other ongoing project, 10 Endrathukulla (2015). Ayngaran International backed out of the film in November 2015, prompting Anand Shankar to re-approach different producers to find new funding for the project. Later on in the month, Shibu Thameens agreed to produce the film and announced that the film would finally begin its first schedule in Malaysia during December 2015. The change of producer also meant significant changes were made to the cast and crew of the film, with Kajal Aggarwal dropped for Nayantara. Bindu Madhavi was left out of the new team, while the makers discussed the secondary lead role with actresses Nithya Menen and Parvathy, before Menen was selected. Likewise R. D. Rajasekhar and Suresh Selvarajan were brought on board to handle the film's cinematography and art direction, respectively. Harris Jayaraj was also subsequently confirmed as the film's music composer, and marked a return to signing films after taking a brief sabbatical.

Did it satisfy?. Good things about the movie first. It had great visuals, locations and good performance from Vikram if not his best performance. Apart from Vikram every one was made to look dumb including Thambi Ramaiah, Karunakaran, Female leads. With a very nice concept they could have made a edge of the seat thriller, but instead the movie is so predictable which makes it boring at many times. Also the movie looks very lengthy. I thought movie was over one hour before the movie actually came to an end. With this concept there at least the action should have been innovative, but that falls flat. We can watch it only if we are a fan of Vikram. helpful•6 2 udayask Sep 28, 2016 Details Edit Release date September 8, 2016 (India) Country of origin India Official sites Facebook Account Official Teaser Language Tamil Also known as Irumugan Production companies NKR Films Thameens Films Thameens Shibu Arts See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget ₹850,000,000 (estimated) Gross worldwide $136,623 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 2 hours 34 minutes Color Color Related news Interview: Actor Kalyani Priyadarshan on the pressures and perks of being a star kid Feb 19The News Minute Iru Mugan Trailer: Vikram Is a Dead Serious Friend and Delightfully Daft Foe Aug 25Screen Anarchy Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Iru Mugan (2016) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Most anticipated Indian movies and shows Percentage shows amount of top page views. 1Marakkar: Lion of the Arabian Sea39.3% 2Ram Asur23.7% 3Bunty Aur Babli 28.2% 4RRR6.0% 5Antim: The Final Truth5.2% 6Pushpa: The Rise - Part 14.2% 7Matsya Kaand3.9% 8Satyameva Jayate 23.8% 9Minnal Murali2.9% 10Dangerous2.8% Updates approximately every 20 minutes.
