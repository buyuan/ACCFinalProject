Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Greg Rucka, the screenwriter & comic book author of the work on which the movie is based, stipulated in his contract that the 'he's not my boyfriend' scene was required to be in any film adaptation. Goofs When Booker hands Andy the unloaded HK USP, she should have noticed. Anyone as familiar with weapons as she is would notice the weight difference between an unloaded gun and a loaded one. The balance of the gun without bullets in a polymer handle would also be very noticeable. Nile, as a marine, also would have noticed when Andy gave it to her. Quotes Soldier: What is he? Your boyfriend? Joe: You're a child. An infant. Your mocking is thus infantile. He's not my boyfriend. This man is more to me than you can dream. He's the moon when I'm lost in darkness and warmth when I shiver in cold. And his kiss still thrills me, even after a millennia. His heart overflows with the kindness of which this world is not worth of. I love this man beyond measure and reason. He's not my boyfriend. He's all and he's more. Nicky: You're an incurable romantic. [Joe and Nicky kiss in front of the stunned guards] Crazy credits Close-ups of the items on the bulletin board with the evidence of the immortal people is seen in the background during the first part of the credits, followed by a scene of video evidence of one of the scenes in the movie being deleted.

User reviews1.7K Review Top review 7/10 Entertaining, would have been a better series Easy viewing, great fight choreography and action scenes. The plot was simply and predictably executed but remained entertaining throughout. Great individual performances but would of been better as a series to allow for some proper character development. helpful•73 43 anthonyduffy Aug 2, 2020 FAQ2 How come her earrings don't pop out like the bullets?
