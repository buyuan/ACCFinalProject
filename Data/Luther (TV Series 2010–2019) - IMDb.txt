He deals with murder cases, often involving serial killers, and has a knack for getting inside the mind of the killer. However, his methods, personality and troubled private life often get him into strife with his superiors, leading some to regard him as the problem rather than the solution. —grantss detectivemurderanti heropsychopathpolice15 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines What if you were on the Devil's side without knowing it?

First, the series seems very traditional in the beginning, and the acting seems strange, and I did not think I would want to complete it, but I was shocked by the improvement that occurs from the first episode in the first season to the last of the season, and the development continues in everything in the story and events and the representation of Idris Elba, which improves in each episode and Every season. The series reaches its climax in the third season and whoever does not follow it has wasted a lot of his or her life. My favorite character is Alice, she is the best character in the show. I am sad and worried that the show may come out from the list of the best in AMDB, but as you know the fifth season is weak, but this is the case for all series. My rating for each season is as follows The first season was held at 8.9 out of 10 The second season I give it 9.0 Season three I give it 9.7 out of 10 Season 4 i give it 8.5 Season 5 i give it 7.0 The show is relly good helpful•50 8 ahmedgorshy Aug 3, 2020 FAQ4 What is "Luther" about? Why Luther let Henry Madsen fall to his death in the first episode of Season 1? Why Zoe left Luther in Season 1?
