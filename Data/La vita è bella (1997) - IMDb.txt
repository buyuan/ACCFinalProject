Guido and his wife have a son and live happily together until the occupation of Italy by German forces. In an attempt to hold his family together and help his son survive the horrors of a Jewish Concentration Camp, Guido imagines that the Holocaust is a game and that the grand prize for winning is a tank. —Anthony Hughes <husnock31@hotmail.com> jewishworld war twonazi occupationtankholocaust77 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines An unforgettable fable that proves love, family and imagination conquer all. (Canadian one sheet) Genres Comedy Drama Romance War Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for holocaust-related thematic elements Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Guido's wife, Dora, is played by Roberto Benigni's real-life wife, Nicoletta Braschi. Goofs Dora calls her husband (Roberto Benigni) "Roberto" rather than "Guido" on one occasion. Quotes Bartolomeo: They are looking for someone who speaks German, to translate their instructions. Guido: Me! I'll do it, I'll translate! Bartolomeo: Do you speak German? Guido: No. Alternate versions The version shown at the Cannes festival in 1998 is slightly different from the original Italian theatrical release: some scenes have been slightly re-edited and a panel has been added at the beginning of the film, showing the phrase "This is a fairy tale", supposedly to avoid controversy over the subject matter.

Gabetti) Ed. Casa Musicale Pucci di Portici (Napoli) User reviews1.4K Review Top review Outstanding This may be one of the best films ever made. I've never seen a movie with such a balance of hysterical comedy and serious drama. Roberto Benigni totally deserved his Oscars. People on this site have said such negative things about him and this film. Mr. Benigni had a lot of guts to make this film, and there's not another film like it. He handled both the comedy and drama aspects beautifully. I loved the beautiful cinematography, scenery, and the characters. This movie is magnificent in every way.
