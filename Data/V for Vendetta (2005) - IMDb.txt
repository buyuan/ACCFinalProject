She is an employee of the state-run British Television Network, but soon, she becomes the number one enemy of the state together with an enigmatic and larger-than-life freedom fighter known only by the letter "V". V informs Evey that she must hide in his underground lair for at least one year, and while she is reluctant to the idea at first, a bond soon forms between the two individuals. In the meanwhile, the mysterious past of V is gradually revealed to the police inspector tasked with capturing him, Eric Finch, and it is not long until he starts questioning everything his government stands for. —goddangwatir revolutiondystopiafreedomfascistoppression419 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Remember, remember the 5th of November, the gun powder treason and plot. I know of no reason why the gun powder treason should ever be forgot. Genres Action Drama Sci-Fi Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for strong violence and some language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The domino scene, where V (Hugo Weaving) tips over black and red dominoes to form a giant letter V, involved 22,000 dominoes. It took four professional domino assemblers 200 hours to set it up. Goofs The aim of the Gunpowder Plot was actually a scheme to blow up the House of Lords, not the House of Commons (commonly referred to as Parliament). Quotes V: People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people. Crazy credits The Warner Bros, DC Comics, Vertigo and Silver Pictures logos are on black-and-white film, and are accompanied by part of the 1812 Overture, thus forming the impression that V is starting a transmission.

At Last Written and Performed by Zakk Wylde's Black Label Society Courtesy of June Street Entertainment User reviews2.3K Review Top review 8/10 More relevant now than when it was made We haven't watched this movie before and it has been out for 15 years. It seemed a tad too cartoonish in the first few minutes so we gave up on it when we first tried to watch many years ago. I am glad we gave it another view tonight-it could be a movie about the events happening today and so very realistic it is frightening. It has a good storyline and the acting is well done. More importantly is the message it carries and we should all take that message seriously if we don't want to end up living in a country governed by martial law, fear and loss of freedom. helpful•20 3 barcmeister4958 Dec 14, 2020 FAQ46 Is "V for Vendetta" based on a book?
