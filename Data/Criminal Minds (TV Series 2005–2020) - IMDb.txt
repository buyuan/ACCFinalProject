Called in by local Police departments to assist in solving crimes of a serial and/or extremely violent nature where the perpetrator is unknown (referred to by the Unit as the unknown subject or "unsub" for short), the B.A.U. uses the controversial scientific art of profiling to track and apprehend the unsub. Profiling entails coming up with basic characteristics of the unsub and the victims (referred to as the victimology), using evidence from the case and matching that information to historic precedents and psychological analyses as a means to solve the case. Because of the nature of the work conducted by the B.A.U. - the work being time consuming and psychologically demanding - its members are fiercely loyal to the Unit and to its other members. Also because of the work's overall demanding nature, not many members of the B.A.U. have been able to maintain a happy or stable family life. —Huggo serial killerserial murdermurder21st century2000s34 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines To catch a criminal, you have to think like one. Genres Crime Drama Mystery Thriller Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Most of the playful banter between Derek Morgan (Shemar Moore) and Penelope Garcia (Kirsten Vangsness) stemmed from the way the actor and actress talked to each other in real life. Goofs A flashback scene shows that Morgan was involved in Garcia's recruitment. But an earlier flashback scene showed their first interaction as occurring when Garcia was already hired. Quotes Aaron "Hotch" Hotchner: This is Special Agent Dr. Reid. Man: Oh, you look too young to have gone to medical school. Dr. Spencer Reid: They are Ph.D.'s, three of them. Man: What, are you a genius or something? Dr. Spencer Reid: I don't believe that intelligence can be accurately quantified, but I do have an IQ of 187, an eidetic memory, can read 20,000 words per minute. [pause] Dr. Spencer Reid: Yes, I'm a genius. Connections Featured in The Messenger (2009) User reviews397 Review Top review Is it Just Me or.... I loved this series. But, it started a nosedive crash into boredom and sloppiness with the introduction of new actors in place of Thomas Gibson and Matthew Gray Gubler. The new characters are dull, drab, hamming their roles and do not fit with the group nicely. The run-time of the episodes also dropped and they wander off into the personal lives of the characters. Is it just me who feeling the show is going downhill or other fans too? I hope they will come back to bring the show to its former status. helpful•84 20 farshidkarimi Feb 4, 2017 FAQ21 Why was season 14 only 15 episodes? What does "Unsub" stand for? Why is Reid's mother in a Sanitarium?
