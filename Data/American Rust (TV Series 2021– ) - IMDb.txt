Connections Featured in Morning Joe: 09-13-2021 (2021) User reviews92 Review Top review 9/10 People don't want to admit this is real. This show accurately reflects the decay of the American Midwest. Mixed reviews you will real here, and elsewhere, will give this show a rating of 5-7 because they are uncomfortable with how close it hits to home. It's a realistic portrayal of the rotting denial that exists throughout the midwest, of industries and livelihoods that are drying up, with nothing, NOTHING to replace them. It's a story of people who have been left behind, jobs shipped overseas and elsewhere, and the decay and hopelessness which follows. It's America TODAY. helpful•20 1 grmorin-240-159508 Oct 24, 2021 Details Edit Release date September 5, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site SHOWTIME Language English Also known as Американська іржа Filming locations Donora, Pennsylvania, USA Production companies Boat Rocker Studios Platform One Media See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour Color Color Sound mix Stereo Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news Sandra Oh and Patina Miller to Be Honored at NY Women in Film and TV Muse Awards (Exclusive) Nov 17The Hollywood Reporter - Film + TV Filmmaker Leads Brooklyn Demonstration for ‘Halyna’s Law,’ a Motion to Ban Real Guns From Film Sets Nov 17Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was American Rust (2021) officially released in Canada in French?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
