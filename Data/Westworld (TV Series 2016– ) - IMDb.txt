(Season 1) Genres Drama Mystery Sci-Fi Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Ben Barnes (Logan) broke his foot before arriving to the first day of shooting. Being afraid of losing the job, he didn't tell anyone, and just used the limp to look like a character choice. He then had to maintain the limp throughout filming. Goofs During the opening credits' animation, a hand is shown firing a revolver. However, the mechanics depicted -- the trigger pull cocking the hammer -- are only true of double-action revolvers. The 1873 Colt pictured would require the hammer to be cocked by the thumb before the trigger could be pulled. Quotes Dr. Robert Ford: You can't play God without being acquainted with the Devil.

Season 3 has earned some unhappy faces among the public. I wasn't impressed with season 3 at first but after a second watch everything fit together. My complaints on season three the first time around revolved around my perception that the writers got lazy, as it appeared like deliberate obfuscation to make it seem more intelligent than it was. But after the second watching I scolded myself for having such a negative opinion. I liked the first season but liked the second one a little better. I hope they make a season 4 but from the complaining and river of tears on this review board, my guess is they are done. Compared to most of HBO's TV series, even with the much complained about season 3, Westworld is still the best TV on HBO. That said there was some clunkiness in season 3, and the characters changed their personas a bit too much for my liking. And for those who complain that the show left the theme park, I think that was apparent from the first season that leaving the park and taking over the planet was the point. helpful•11 2 offmylawn-57047 Jan 3, 2021 FAQ5 What would the operating costs of a theme park with this level of sophistication be? Why do we constantly see new hosts being made? Are there different versions of hosts?
