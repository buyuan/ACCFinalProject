Genres Animation Adventure Comedy Family Fantasy Horror Certificate TV-Y7 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Courage's dialogue decreased after the first season. This is because the creators at Cartoon Network thought Courage "talked too much" and wanted his dialogue cut short. Goofs Throughout the series, the closet under the staircase in the living room appears and disappears in some episodes. Quotes Muriel: Courage, you know I can't hear without my glasses... Crazy credits The episode end title evolved with each season: The first season has Courage holding up a scribbled end title card the second and third seasons have an ornate sculpture of a bowing Courage and the final season has a CGI Courage taking a bow. Connections Featured in The 1st 13th Annual Fancy Anvil Awards Show Program Special: Live in Stereo (2002) User reviews87 Review Top review GREAT Who ever doesn't like this show is a PATHETIC person who has no, absolutely No sense of Humor! Courage is so sweet, he reminds me of a dog I used to have. Sure, It is pretty gross, but so was Ren and Stimpy and people loved that show, (well everyone I knew loved it) Courage is not supposed to be brave and protect his owner. Come ON, what does he look like, a Guard Dog?! Besides he is a cartoon, and he ends up saving his master like dogs would. This is definetly good, different from that TRASh on Nick, Eeh, just to think of those Horrid Shows, well anyways it is has a creepy quality to it, which is great, and Courage is a loveable character. helpful•60 16 Psade569 Jul 31, 2002 FAQ1 Where's my mallet?
