User reviews23 Review Top review 5/10 try but lack a decent script and immersive scenes. Probably too many budget restrictions. Scenes feels too slow . I wanted to like it better. It is watchable, and maybe a female audience will enjoy it better then the male ones? Cheers. helpful•1 0 surfisfun Nov 5, 2021 Details Edit Release date March 29, 2021 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United States Official site Official site Language English Filming locations Los Angeles, California, USA Production companies Defiant Studios Kodiak Pictures See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 38 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 2.39:1 Related news Exclusive Interview – Production Designer Holly Trotta on Witch Hunt Oct 28Flickeringmyth The Best Board Games to Buy for Halloween Oct 13Indiewire Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Witch Hunt (2021) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
