Whoa but when it goes on it completely turns into a thrilling nail-biting, heart-touching, mind-teasing epic series taking us deep into humanity through the imaginative Naruto universe questioning our view on the world and people. This was one of the most influential stories I have ever witnessed. I wanted more, so I looked for best anime around to see if I can find something even better. What I found was, most of the other anime are bound around power, adrenaline rush, love and sacrifice, .etc . But in Naruto, apart from the all the things that I mentioned above it mainly focuses on what humanity is, where can it go wrong and what it might take to fix it. That being said, don't misunderstand, the battles are epic. When I mean epic, I mean EPIC!!! For me the best part is, no matter how powerful opponents are, the one with the sharp mind comes on top with mind-blowing strategies. For nerds who watch Anime like me, this is the best part. And oh! to see the maturity of the characters in the series from the childhood of being total knuckleheads to genuinely matured full fledged Shinobi(Ninja) is surely an amazing journey to take. One which must not be missed by the genuine minds around the globe. helpful•106 14 akalankapagoda Sep 10, 2014 Details Edit Release date February 15, 2007 (Japan) Country of origin Japan Official sites Adult Swim Official site Languages English Japanese Also known as Naruto: Shippuden Production company Pierrot See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 24 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news Naruto Characters, Ranked From Least To Most Likely To Win The Hunger Games Nov 6ScreenRant.com Naruto: 10 Saddest Deaths, Ranked Sep 30ScreenRant.com Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
