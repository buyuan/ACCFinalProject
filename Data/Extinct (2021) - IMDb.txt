Genres Animation Adventure Comedy Family Certificate TV-Y7 Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia TriStar Pictures' second animated film, after Planet 51 (2009). Soundtracks Piano Sonata No. 11 in a Major, K.331 / 300I 'Turkish March' Written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart User reviews21 Review Top review 7/10 So much more entertaining than the rebellion. We're getting more of these sino-Netflix productions and I must say I am impressed with how much they improve on China's other attempts in animated fun during the last decade. A professional, pacy, lively and adorable adventure awaits in a movie that could have so easily gone down the path of mawkish ecology but knows how to keep it fun. Expect tons of anatomical gags but they don't detract from the delightful dynamic of live wire and her neurotic brother. At the heart of the story is a relationship where both members have to re-assess the way they treat or regard their sibling and it's all actually pretty satisfying. Very visually beautiful with superb character designs, radiant back grounds and slick animation for its visual humor, my only real negative is how in the middle act they devote too much time to this quest through these time portals. It's a bit too much like a Mario game, you know? But overall I was pleasantly surprised by this free-spirited no-brainer adventure that even has a song. helpful•4 3 GiraffeDoor Sep 12, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 3, 2021 (China) Countries of origin United States China Official sites Cinesite Timelessfilms Language English Also known as 拯救甜甜圈：时空大营救 Production companies China Lion Entertainment Production Cinesite Animation HB Wink Animation See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross worldwide $6,929,315 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 24 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news New on Netflix: November 2021 Releases Nov 1Den of Geek Sky Cinema: What’s New in September 2021?
