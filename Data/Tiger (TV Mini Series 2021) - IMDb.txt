I know this feels exploitative, and I know it doesn't seem right to steal the last amounts of privacy Tiger has left, BUT this provided so much insight into how one of the greatest sports figures in American history was built. I unfortunately was compelled by some of the personal strife he went through (his father cheating, Tiger's ability to bury the things that chipped away at his amour). I think his story is important because you learn that the icons you place on a pedestal are nothing more than men. They are flesh, blood, and tears. helpful•43 6 matthewreid-95654 Jan 13, 2021 Details Edit Release date January 10, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Tiger, el auge, la caída y el regreso de Tiger Woods Production companies HBO Documentary Films HBO Sports Jigsaw Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 3 hours 12 minutes Color Color Related news Rotterdam Competition Contender ‘Destello Bravio’ Picked Up by Patra Spanou Film (Exclusive) Feb 7Variety Film + TV Rotterdam film festival 2021 winners revealed Feb 7ScreenDaily Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
