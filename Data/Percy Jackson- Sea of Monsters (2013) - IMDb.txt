Genres Adventure Family Fantasy Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG for fantasy action violence, some scary images and mild language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Portions of Circeland were filmed in the now-defunct Six Flags New Orleans, formerly known as Jazzland. The park was forced to close due to damage from Hurricane Katrina. Goofs Polyphemus wears the Golden Fleece, which is said to have the power to heal or cure anything, on his shoulder throughout the film, yet his eyesight is still greatly affected by the injury he sustained from Odysseus, enough so that he mistakes Grover for a female cyclops.

Thought the first film was alright, but a mediocre version of the books. When I heard that there was going to be a second one, I was very skeptical that it would work considering the number of bad changes they've done to the Lightning Thief. But once I learned that screen writers Scott Alexander & Larry Karaszewski were hired to adapt it (who aren't credited for some reason), I began to feel hopeful for the Sea of Monsters. Alexander and Karaszewski had previously worked on the bio-pics Ed Wood, The People vs. Larry Flynt, and Man on the Moon. I thought that they'd look up the books and do justice to Percy Jackson. Just came back from seeing it and I really like it, thought it was better than The Lightning Thief. I didn't think that it was a great film, some of the dialogue felt awkward to me, but overall I had fun and felt some justice was done. Yes, there was some changes made to the Sea of Monsters but nothing as bad as the previous film. I enjoyed watching Stanley Tucci (Mr. D), Anthony Stewart Head (Chiron), and Ron Perlman (Polyphemus). Definitely see it if you like the books. Now I'm hoping to see the next films in the series! helpful•51 40 Canadian_Haggis Aug 10, 2013 FAQ2 Will this have the same actors as the first one? Will there be a sequel to this film?
