User reviews4 Review Top review 10/10 This film, it is the truth . . . Whatever one might think about the content and context of this film, it is the truth. This is one of those exceedingly rare examples of filmcraft where everything was delivered about as perfectly as possible. The characters, the scenarios . . . the acting and direction is absolutely spot on. I know this world, the tweeker universe and the absolute nightmare that comes with it. The story that is utilized as the delivery platform is very credible, the characters as delivered are as real as it gets. If anything, aside from the entertainment aspect that this film might deliver, this should be an educational film for anyone who is even remotely tempted to step into this universe. Trust me on this one . . . it's a place you don't want to be, and I can't imagine a better delivery vehicle to get this point across than the content of this film. Not even a nanosecond of hesitation . . . 10 stars, and then some. helpful•5 1 charles000 Oct 9, 2013 Details Edit Release date December 16, 2011 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Filming locations Cleveland, Texas, USA Production companies Greenwood Films Red Noses Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $700,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $17,977 Opening weekend US & Canada $7,579 Dec 18, 2011 Gross worldwide $17,977 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 33 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Cook County (2008) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
