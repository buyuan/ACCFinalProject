Personal Quote: I wondered about the availability of porn everywhere and how it affected what they thought about sex, what it was, what influence it had. Trivia: Got into an argument during a dinner with Hamish McAlpine, the British distributor of his upcoming movie Ken Park (2002), over politics. Clark punched him, which prompted McAlpine to pull the movie from the London Festival.
