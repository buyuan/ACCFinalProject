Iñárritu. But when negotiations fell through due to not reaching a financial agreement, DiCaprio opted out and was shortly replaced by Bradley Cooper. Ironically enough, Cooper ended up replacing DiCaprio in Paul Thomas Anderson's Licorice Pizza (2021). Quotes Clem Hoately: Step right up and behold one of the unexplained mysteries of the universe! Is he a man or beast? This creature has been examined by the foremost scientists and pronounced, unequivocally, a man. I am prepared to offer you folks one last chance to witness this supreme oddity. Where did it come from? Begotten by the same and threat that got us all walking on this earth, but gone wrong somehow in maternal womb. Not fit for living. Is it a beast, or is it a man? You're in luck, because tonight, you will see him feed! Come on in and find out. Is he man... or beast?
