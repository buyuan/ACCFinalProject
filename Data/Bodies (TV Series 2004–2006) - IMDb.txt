On both occasions he was played by Nicholas Palliser. Connections Featured in WatchMojoUK: Top 10 British Medical Dramas (2018) User reviews27 Review Top review Very realistic I work in the NHS, and this is the most realistic drama I've seen. None of your dewy-eyed idealism of casualty et al, this shows what hospitals are really like, and it's not pretty. I think the acting is great, on the whole, Max Beesley is a really realistic sort of person, and Neve NcIntosh looks really anxious and upset, which judging by the circumstances, she probably ought to be. My favourite bit is when one gynaecologist tells the manager that there's a four letter word that describes a gynaecological orifice, and he's the biggest one he's ever met! Absolutely priceless! I wonder if they'll make any more, they should move it to BBC1 if they do. helpful•8 4 smn10 Nov 12, 2004 Details Edit Release date May 23, 2004 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Official sites BBC America (United States) BBC Three (United Kingdom) Language English Also known as Тела Filming locations West Yorkshire, England, UK Production company Hat Trick Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 16 : 9 Related news ‘Bodyguard’ Creator Jed Mercurio Strikes First-Look Deal With 20th Television Via Htm Television Banner Nov 4Deadline Film + TV 20th Television Sets First-Look Deal With Jed Mercurio, Jimmy Mulville’s Htm Television Nov 4Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Bodies (2004) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
