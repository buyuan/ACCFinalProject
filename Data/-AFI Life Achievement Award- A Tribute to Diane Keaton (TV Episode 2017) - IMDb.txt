However, this show isn't about what the other performers say, but about Miss Keaton, and in interviews with Miss Keaton and the clips from her many and varied roles, that this show begins to show the emotional and intellectual intelligence that she brings to her roles. Not, alas, to her fashion sense. When the show began with her strolling through the crowd, talking to people as if she weren't the center of attention, I thought how much she dressed like the character she had played in ANNIE HALL.... which Woody Allen had based on her and had allowed her to choose her own outfits for. helpful•0 2 boblipton Aug 2, 2017 Details Edit Release date June 15, 2017 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Official site Also known as AFI Life Achievement Award: A Tribute to Diane Keaton Filming locations Dolby Theatre - 6801 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood & Highland Center, Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, USA Production company AFI Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 46 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
