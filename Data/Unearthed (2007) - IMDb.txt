The place should have been completely packed, but it was nearly empty. We soon learned why. Unearthed has a generic, by-the-numbers plot crammed full of the same old tired horror-movie clichés. It had no direction to speak of. The camera work was amateurish at best, and the dialog nearly incoherent. The camera was pointing all over the place, providing an occasional glimpse of something like a face, a vehicle, or a building. Most scenes were too dark and cluttered to make out anything clearly. Don't even imagine that this stuff belongs in the "so-bad-it's-good" category. Those movies at least have some originality, humor (even if it's unintentional), and other qualities that make them stand out. They are the kind of movies that people remember, whether they want to or not. Unearthed has nothing worth remembering. I can barely recall even one single scene; the only thing I can remember clearly is waiting for it to be over. It seemed to drag on for several hours or more. Very soon, this thing will be dead, buried, and totally forgotten. May it rest in peace--FOREVER. helpful•52 21 t-h-fields Nov 18, 2007 Details Edit Release date June 18, 2007 (China) Country of origin United States Official sites Official MySpace Page Official site Language English Also known as Desenterrados Filming locations Salt Lake City, Utah, USA Production companies Cold Iron Pictures Ambush Entertainment Combustion Studios See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross US & Canada $97,182 Opening weekend US & Canada $512,000 Nov 11, 2007 Gross worldwide $97,182 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 33 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 Related news Madalina Ghenea & Ed Westwick Starring In Shark Survival Thriller ‘Deep Fear’ Nov 17Deadline Film + TV Ed Westwick, Madalina Ghenea to Star in Shark Survival Thriller ‘Deep Fear’ Nov 17Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Unearthed (2007) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
