Connections Featured in The Wright Stuff: Episode #11.31 (2009) User reviews22 Review Top review 9/10 Fantastic little known British comedy! The inbetweeners for a slightly older audience! If you love British comedy you will love how not to live your life. It is the Inbetweeners for thirty somethings. It tells the story of Don Danbury, a late twenty something no hoper, aimlessly plodding through life, going from one comedic failure to the next. His character starts out as a shallow, hollow sketch of a man, but by the end of the second series he has developed in to a well fleshed out thinking and feeling man, helped by his "carer" Eddie and Don's quest to find the girl of his dreams. I suggest you start with series 1, then go on to series 2, rather than jumping in to random episodes to fully understand all the characters and get yourself ready for series 3 (starting soon on BBC 3, I can't wait) Series 2 leaves us on a cliffhanger. Will Don, or won't Don? My only complaint and its a very minor one, is that I hope series 3 shows less of Mrs Treacher and more of Eddie. Her character, although at times hysterically funny, is often superfluous. If you like the Inbetweeners, the Young Ones, 15 Stories High, you will love How not to live your life. helpful•12 2 markp-com Sep 20, 2010 Details Edit Release date September 27, 2007 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Language English Also known as Како не живети свој живот Production company Brown Eyed Boy See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 28 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 1.78 : 1 Related news How Not to Live Your Life's Dan Clark: 'I'd bring the show back' Dec 2Digital Spy Julia Davis bringing breakfast TV spoof to Channel 4 Nov 11Digital Spy Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the English language plot outline for How Not to Live Your Life (2007)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
