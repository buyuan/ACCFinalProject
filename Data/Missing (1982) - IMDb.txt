Genres Biography Drama History Mystery Thriller Certificate PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia During the Pinochet dictatorship, which ran from 1973 to 1990, this picture was banned in Chile. Goofs In the scene where Jack Lemmon is at the State Department early in the movie trying to get information about Charlie, there is the presidential portrait of Richard Nixon on the wall in the background and a more personal photo of him on Marine One on the credenza behind the desk. That photograph, with fingers in the V-peace sign, was taken upon his final departure from the White House in 1974 and could not have been on someone's desk in 1973. Quotes Silvio: You Americans, you always assume you must do something before you can be arrested.

User reviews107 Review Top review 9/10 This film changed my life I was 17 when I first saw the film in 1982 and I can say, that it changed my life. Up to that I believe in my own government an I believe in the US, as a strong friend of all democratic countries. After this film I'd never take the things for real. I questioned everything and this is good. Use your mind, try to get informations from all sides. I think Chile is one reason, that the US doesn't sign the treaty for the international court, because guys like Kissinger had to be scared, that he has to take responsability for Chile and Vietnam. Everything was said of the great performance of the actors in this film. This is the best political thriller ever made. helpful•104 35 Ucurian Jun 10, 2002 FAQ4 What is the background to the film?
