Jordan did not want to film in his own home for privacy reasons, so producers scouted other homes in the Malibu, California area that they felt would fit Jordan's taste and style. Connections Featured in Good Morning America: Episode dated 16 April 2020 (2020) User reviews493 Review Top review 10/10 It's personal. A great docu-series, kudos on the direction and putting it all together, making it very exciting to watch. Undeniably, Michael Jordan is the master in finding motivation. For every episode, every grudge, every game...it's getting personal for Michael. The rest of the Bulls protagonists also make this dynasty memorable and they all together bring back a nostalgia for the 90s. But for Mike, it's always personal. Overall, some time jumps are confusing and some important things maybe are brushed off too fast, while other events get a greater mention than they should; that's the only negative thing I could spot. The rest looks great, especially the remastered footage and the interviews. If you are not familiar with the 90s Bulls and Michael Jordan then this will provide a 360 view on the legend. 10/10 helpful•160 31 ThomDerd May 18, 2020 Details Edit Release date April 19, 2020 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Official Netflix Official site (ESPN) Language English Also known as 最後一舞 Filming locations Chicago, Illinois, USA Production companies ESPN Films NBA Entertainment Mandalay Sports Media (MSM) See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 8 hours 11 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news George Gervin Documentary In Works From ‘Last Dance’ Producer Mike Tollin’s Msm, GameAbove Entertainment & Director One9 Nov 17Deadline Film + TV Lena Waithe developing drama based on acclaimed documentary Hoop Dreams Nov 16Flickeringmyth Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was The Last Dance (2020) officially released in Canada in French?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
