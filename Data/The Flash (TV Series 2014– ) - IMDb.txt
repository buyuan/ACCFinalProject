All that changes when a massive particle accelerator accident leads to Barry being struck by lightning in his lab. Coming out of coma nine months later, Barry and his new friends at S.T.A.R labs find that he now has the ability to move at superhuman speed. Furthermore, Barry learns that he is but one of many affected by that event, most of whom are using their powers for evil. Determined to make a difference, Barry dedicates his life to fighting such threats, as The Flash. While he gains allies he never expected, there are also secret forces determined to aid and manipulate him for their own agenda. —Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) superhuman speeddc arrowversesuperherodc comicsbased on comic50 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Discover what makes a hero (Season 1) Genres Action Adventure Drama Sci-Fi Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia When Barry is showing S.T.A.R.

Quotes [Season 1 opening] Barry Allen: My name is Barry Allen and I'm the fastest man alive. When I was a child, I saw my mother killed by something impossible. My father went to prison for her murder. Then an accident made me the impossible. To the outside world, I'm just an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly I use my speed to fight crime and find others like me, and one day I'll find who killed my mother and get justice for my father. I am The Flash. Crazy credits Each week's opening credits during the voiceover words "fight crime and find others like me" changes to show the previous week's metahuman encounter.
