Never had to win, did I? You gotta do more in there. You gotta win a title. For you, for me, for Lowell. This is your time, all right? You take it. I had my time and I blew it. You don't have to. All right? You fuckin' get out there, and use all the shit that you've been through, all that fuckin' hell, all the shit we've gone through over the fuckin' years, and you put it in that ring right now. This is yours. This is fuckin' yours. Crazy credits The real Micky Ward and Dicky Eklund are shown during the end credits.

Written by Kelvin Swaby, Dan Taylor, Spencer Page, Chris Ellul and Arlester Christian Performed by The Heavy Courtesy of Counter Records User reviews476 Review Top review 7/10 The Fighter driven only by flawless performances. Look, i like the film, I think it's awesome but I also think were the characters were played by less effective actors, this wouldn't be as awesome as it is. The biggest fault for me, is that the main character has less personality than most sports characters in sport films. Mickey Ward (Mark Wahlberg) has a crackhead brother, former boxing great played flawlessly by Christian Bale, and he has manager-mom played by brilliant Melissa Leo. Mark Wahlberg has range, he is a good actor, but Mickey just fell flat for me. I wasn't invested much in Mickey so when the boxing matches came on, I didn't care much. But the performances by the backup cast are fantastic. If anything, that's worth the concession price. helpful•11 1 jcaesar-01251 Mar 3, 2017 FAQ3 Is "The Fighter" based on a book?
