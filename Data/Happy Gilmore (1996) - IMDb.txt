He joins the P.G.A. tour to make some money to save grandma's house. The downside is that his hockey player mentality doesn't really go on the P.G.A. tour. Especially with the favorite to win the championship. —Kevin Mitchell <kevin@mitchell.mdn.com> golfgolf coursereference to david hasselhoffcensored profanityunpaid taxes121 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines He doesn't play golf... he destroys it. Genres Comedy Sport Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for language and some comic sexuality Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Bob Barker wasn't sure if he wanted to be in the movie. When he learned that he was going to win the fight with Adam Sandler, he accepted the role. Goofs At the beginning when Happy is playing hockey, he hits the puck at the glass which the two men are standing behind. The glass clearly gets broken but then in the next close-up shot of the two men, the glass is back because a reflection can be seen in it. Quotes Shooter McGavin: [after buying grandma's house in an auction] You're in big trouble though, pal. I eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast! Happy Gilmore: [laughing] You eat pieces of shit for breakfast? Shooter McGavin: [long pause] No! Crazy credits The End appears before the end credits roll. Alternate versions In the TV version Happy talks to the orderly (Ben Stiller) and tells him that grandma has told him everything. He then throws Stiller out the window. When Stiller hits the ground he says "Noy is that guy strong". then the old people come out and beat him with their hands, purses, canes, and etc. Connections Featured in Late Night with Conan O'Brien: Adam Sandler/Roger Ebert/Chris Jagger (1996) Soundtracks Tuesday's Gone Written by Allen Collins, Ronnie Van Zant Performed by Lynyrd Skynyrd Courtesy of MCA Records User reviews362 Review Top review 7/10 Still makes me laugh This is a real classic.
