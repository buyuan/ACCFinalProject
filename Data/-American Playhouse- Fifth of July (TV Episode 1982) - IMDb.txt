User reviews5 Review Top review 10/10 Brilliant, sorrowfully overlooked The Fifth of July has been one of my favourite plays/movie. I fist saw it on PBS and have never forgotten it. Not only is the play brilliant, the cast is first rate and superb. A cast like this with such a wonderful story makes for great entertainment.
