Doctor Watson is now a fairly young veteran of the Afghan war, less adoring and more active. —KGF Vissers friendshipmodernized settingdetectivebased on novelgenius48 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines The Game is On Genres Crime Drama Mystery Thriller Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The character of Greg Lestrade is a combination of Inspectors Gregson and Lestrade. In the books, the latter character's first name is said to begin with the letter G, but is never revealed. This is why Sherlock is always forgetting Lestrade's first name. Quotes Mycroft Holmes: All lives end; all hearts are broken. Caring is not an advantage, Sherlock. Crazy credits In the American (PBS Masterpiece Mystery) broadcasts of this series, certain letters in the closing titles are highlighted red. These letters spell out a word that somehow relates to the episode. These highlighted letters don't occur in the closing credits of the original airings of the series (on BBC) though.
