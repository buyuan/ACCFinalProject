User reviews685 Review Top review 9/10 Clarkson did a thing. I binged this over two days, and i loved it. The best part was that Gerald had no subtitles, no one has a clue what he is saying. In my country we have similar shows, but i really enjoyed watching this. I hope there's going to be a season 2. helpful•108 3 idiocracy_l Jun 13, 2021 FAQ1 When this will be released?
