He gains the assistance of a strange man, who promises to help Geralt but also forces him to pay off a seemingly impossible debt. Soon, it becomes clear that a much more sinister story lies beneath the new and intriguing characters. —Dirk McThermot female medicmasked robberstereotypinghouse on fireredhead159 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Action Adventure Drama Fantasy Horror Mystery Romance Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia Upon examining a portrait of Olgierd and Iris von Everec during his venture in the von Everec mansion, Geralt says "All happy families are alike, each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way". This is a direct quote from Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy. Quotes Countess Mignole: [of Vesemir] Please, tell me... did he at least die like a witcher? Geralt of Rivia: No. He died like a hero. Connections Followed by Wiedzmin 3: Dziki Gon Krew i wino (2016) User reviews10 Review Top review 9/10 An infinite universe The remaining expansion pack from the main quests of the Witcher 3 Wild Hunt and that's Hearts of Stone . Geralt meets up with an old friend Shaani . And then he tries to reunite a broken married couple from a rich household . The Von Everecs . Olgeird and Iris von Everec torn into nightmare by deceit and power , but there's also Gaunter O'Dimm a.k.a Master Mirror who has a score to settle with the Von Everecs with a personal vendetta, but it's also a choice based game on which the player has a choice to choose whatever they want based on how the story evolves . The reason the Witcher games have gotten the highest ratings possibly for any games is mainly because you can do anything in this game. You can wear anything, you can go anywhere, choose anything, weaponise anything, utilize the general accessories to it's maximum, increase your mutation powers, it's over detailed. But many things one surely needs to recheck in order to find it maybe from the internet. Certain items or certain ingredients. The glamorous world of the thirteenth century sparks magnificently. It has an elite line up of monsters and characters along with it's in-depth details . Which oil and which ingredient will work on which monster and how to enhance and craft and dismantle and it goes on and on . This is the biggest game I've ever played content and detail wise .. I've never collected more collectables in any other game than in this game . They've created sort of almost like an infinite universe in which the more you explore the lesser it is .. quite fascinating and a remarkable achievement for a video game . I wrote all this for the whole Witcher 3 Wild Hunt game. helpful•1 0 razzakahmed Jul 30, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 13, 2015 (Poland) Country of origin Poland Official site Official website Languages English Polish Also known as The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Hearts of Stone Production company CD Projekt RED See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Color Color Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
