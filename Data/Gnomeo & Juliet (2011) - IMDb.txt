But with plastic pink flamingos and lawnmower races in the mix, can this young couple find lasting happiness? —Walt Disney Pictures gardengnomeflamingoneighborgarden gnome54 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines An epic tale on a tiny scale. Genres Animation Adventure Comedy Family Fantasy Musical Romance Certificate G Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The name of the pink lawn flamingo, "Featherstone", is an homage to the creator of the original pink flamingo lawn ornament, Don Featherstone. All official pink flamingos now carry Don Featherstone's signature on the bottom of the bird. Goofs When Featherstone starts to reflect on the memory of his mate, the female flamingo is on the left, however, when the moving van arrives to move the female, the female flamingo is on the right. Quotes Juliet: Oh, Gnomeo, Gnomeo, are we really doomed to never see each other again? Why must you wear a blue hat? Why couldn't it be red like my father, or green like... like a leprechaun... or purple like, ummm, like some weird guy - I mean what's in a gnome? Because you are blue, my father sees red, and because I am red, I am feeling blue. Oh, at any rate that shouldn't be the thing to keep us apart, should it? Gnomeo: No, no, it shouldn't! I couldn't have said it better myself! Juliet: Oh, my giddy aunt, did you just hear all that? What are you doing here? Gnomeo: I don't know! I just wanted to, uh [Gives a nervous chuckle] Gnomeo: , I just wanted to see you again! Juliet: Are you crazy? If my dad finds you he'll bury you under the patio! Gnomeo: 'Finds me', are you joking? 'Stealth' is my middle name! [Steps on the button which sets off a display of bright lights] Crazy credits The end credits come with animated backdrops. Alternate versions Also released in a 3D version.

When I first saw trailers for "Gnomeo & Juliet", I groaned at the thought: Romeo and Juliet as told by garden gnomes? Really? Aside from the obvious absurdity of the concept, I wondered exactly how faithfully they'd stick to the story. The ending of Shakespeare's original story would prove awfully dark for the young audiences that would be naturally drawn to this. So, with these reservations in mind I saw the film last night with my 7 and 10 year old daughters, and found myself enjoying the movie much more than I expected to. Is the concept absurd? Sure, but the writers made plenty of clever use of that absurdity, with some great sight gags and setups. I won't go into detail on the issue of the original's dark ending, but the writers here found a sly way to acknowledge that original ending without having to actually incorporate it in this loose remake. Elton John is credited as an Exec Producer (and his partner David Furnish has a Producer credit as well). The movie makes liberal use of EJ's music, generally to good effect. And my daughters both loved it. Great family fare. helpful•32 11 Thunderbuck Feb 20, 2011 Details Edit Release date February 11, 2011 (Canada) Countries of origin United Kingdom United States Canada Ireland Official site Official Facebook Languages English Japanese Spanish German Also known as Gnomeo y Julieta Production companies Touchstone Pictures Rocket Pictures Arc Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $36,000,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $99,967,670 Opening weekend US & Canada $25,356,909 Feb 13, 2011 Gross worldwide $193,967,670 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 24 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital SDDS DTS Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Amazon Prime Video New Releases: November 2021 Nov 1Den of Geek New On Amazon Prime Video For November 2021: Daily Listings For Streaming TV, Movies & More Oct 26Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Spanish language plot outline for Gnomeo & Juliet (2011)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
