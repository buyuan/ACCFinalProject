The massacre saw British government forces charge into a crowd of over 60,000 that had gathered to demand political reform and protest against rising levels of poverty. Many protesters were killed and hundreds more injured, sparking a nationwide outcry but also further government suppression. The Peterloo Massacre was a defining moment in British democracy which also played a significant role in the founding of The Guardian newspaper. manchesteryear 1819rallyprotest rallyprime minister16 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Drama History Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for a sequence of violence and chaos Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The film was released 200 years after the notorious Peterloo Massacre.
