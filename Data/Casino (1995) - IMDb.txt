Ace Rothstein and Nicky Santoro, mobsters who move to Las Vegas to make their mark, live and work in this paradoxical world. Seen through their eyes, each as a foil to the other, the details of mob involvement in the casinos of the 1970s and '80s are revealed. Ace is the smooth operator of the Tangiers casino, while Nicky is his boyhood friend and tough strongman, robbing and shaking down the locals. However, they each have a tragic flaw--Ace falls in love with a hustler, Ginger, and Nicky falls into an ever-deepening spiral of drugs and violence. —Tad Dibbern <DIBBERN_D@a1.mscf.upenn.edu> crime epiccasinogamblinggangsterlas vegas nevada395 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines You don't stay at the top forever Genres Crime Drama Certificate 17 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Most of the conversations between Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci were improvised. Martin Scorsese would tell them where to start and where to end. The rest was up to them. Goofs After the failed car bombing, Sam is put into the ambulance feet-first. People are loaded into ambulances head-first, since most of the monitoring equipment is in the front. Quotes [first lines] Ace Rothstein: [voice-over] When you love someone, you've gotta trust them. There's no other way. You've got to give them the key to everything that's yours. Otherwise, what's the point? And for a while, I believed, that's the kind of love I had.

Based on a true story, Martin Scorsese "Casino" is a motion picture about two characters and their chance to rule the desert paradise of Las Vegas We are introduced in with all the lights, the noise, the flashing and the colors of the town that doesn't sleep day or night De Niro's character, Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, is based on Frank "Lefty" Rosenthal, who was a hell of a handicapper He was so good that whenever he bets, he could change the odds for every bookmaker in the country Genius at what he was doing with numbers, he proved to a lot of guys in the Chicago Mob that he was a tremendous earner that he could make a lot of money for them As a result, he was able to accomplish whatever bookmaking, handicapping, he wanted to do, with the umbrella of protection from those guys 'Ace' runs the casino with an iron fist refusing any outside people cheating at his tables But he had a fatal flaw 'Ace' always felt that he could logically and intelligently deal with things, even to deal with emotions So he decides on making a life with a woman who, he knows, does not necessarily love him Anyway with such a sexy wife and money to burn, 'Ace' was the epitome of opulence, confidence and power Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) was fascinating Great woman, truly beautiful, one of the best-known hustlers in town For her, a guy like 'Ace' was the ultimate score So the way to Ginger's heart was clearly money 'Ace' knew that but he didn't careWhat he wanted was to marry her Sharon Stone really stood up to the challenge in her role as a casino hustler who is so wild She was young, fresh, confident, looking absolutely fantastic as the independent woman whom everybody desires Joe Pesci succeeds in his scary tough role as the strong man who has nerve, and isn't afraid of the cops He was reportedly a mob hit man reputed to be a sadistic killer (In one scene, his character is shown torturing someone by putting his head in a vise.) To protect his friend and adviser, Nicky (Pesci) would beat to a pulp any street guys who messed with 'Ace' or didn't give him the proper respect Over the course of their friendship Nicky delivered a number of these messages always making sure that 'Ace' didn't get his hands dirty 'Ace' witnessed several beatings on his behalf Nicky's mission was to show his worth to the family as an enforcer The clothes on De Niro looked very straight, more dangerous and very threatening They were very important cues to his character, and again, to the progression of the story 'Ace' was an extremely fastidious guy And, of course, as you follow the story he starts out in more conservative colors and as things become more chaotic, the colors become more chaotic helpful•75 25 Nazi_Fighter_David May 22, 2007 FAQ9 What is the story around the vice scene? Where exactly is 'back home' for Ace and Nicky? Is "Casino" based on fact?
