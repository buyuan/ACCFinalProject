Logan, whose power to self-heal is dwindling, has surrendered himself to alcohol and now earns a living as a chauffeur. He takes care of the ailing old Professor X whom he keeps hidden away. One day, a female stranger asks Logan to drive a girl named Laura to the Canadian border. At first he refuses, but the Professor has been waiting for a long time for her to appear. Laura possesses an extraordinary fighting prowess and is in many ways like Wolverine. She is pursued by sinister figures working for a powerful corporation; this is because they made her, with Logan's DNA. A decrepit Logan is forced to ask himself if he can or even wants to put his remaining powers to good use. It would appear that in the near-future, the times in which they were able put the world to rights with razor sharp claws and telepathic powers are now over. marvel comicsx mensuperheromutantnorth dakota562 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines His time has come Genres Action Drama Sci-Fi Thriller Certificate 17 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia When Charles Xavier suffers from his seizures, Hugh Jackman did not act as if he was being pushed away. Instead, he was held back by a rope pulled by two men in order to give a more realistic portrayal of being restrained. Goofs (at around 1h 1 min) During Xavier's seizure in the hotel, everyone is frozen in place by the assault. As Logan passes by the slot machines, one lady is looking around unaffected by the paralysis. Quotes Logan: Nature made me a freak. Man made me a weapon. And God made it last too long. Crazy credits In the closing credits, the words "Alpha Flight" appears under Camera Units. Alpha Flight is the name of a Canadian superhero group that Wolverine was originally a member of in the comics. Alternate versions Some Blu-ray releases include "Logan Noir," a black and white version of the film.
