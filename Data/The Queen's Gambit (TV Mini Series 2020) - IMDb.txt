That is, until she plays her first game of chess. Her senses grow sharper, her thinking clearer, and for the first time in her life she feels herself fully in control. By the age of sixteen, she's competing for the U.S. Open championship. But as Beth hones her skills on the professional circuit, the stakes get higher, her isolation grows more frightening, and the thought of escape becomes all the more tempting. Based on the book by Walter Tevis. addictionchessfemale protagonist1950stv mini series46 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genre Drama Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Unlike a majority of movies and television shows depicting chess boards, the chess boards are always set up correctly in this series and the chess games and positions are realistic. National Master Bruce Pandolfini and Grandmaster Garry Kasparov acted as consultants for this series. Goofs Algebraic chess notation (i.e. a1-h8), which appears frequently throughout the series, was rarely used by English-speaking players in the 1960s, descriptive notation (e.g. P-K4, N-KB3) being the prevalent notation. However, for strong English-speaking players to keep up with developments, familiarity with algebraic notation, the predominant form in European and Soviet chess literature, would have been essential. Quotes Harry Beltik: Anger's a potent spice. A pinch wakes you up. Too much dulls your senses. Connections Edited into Creating the Queen's Gambit (2021) User reviews2.5K Review Top review 10/10 Best Netflix Original of 2020 The Queen's Gambit was a random find for me. I started watching it without any expectations but the first episode was just enough to keep me interested. As I kept watching, it kept getting better and I must say the 7th episode was one of the best finale to a series that I have ever watched. The character developments for even the minor characters were well-thought-out and I immediately formed an emotional connection with most of them. The finale was so well done that it almost felt like an end to a show with several seasons rather than a limited series. The show also had very good messages sprinkled in between, they were subtle and didn't make me feel like an agenda was being showed down my throat. The acting was marvelous. The cinematography was great with some very impressive scene transitions. The score was amazing and really set the atmosphere and the tone of the show. If you are reading this before watching the show, go ahead and watch it. You won't be disappointed. helpful•1.9K 131 bilgedeger Oct 25, 2020 FAQ7 What is the film going on, episode 3, hotel room sharing beer? (dialogue defines "gimmick". Have any chess experts examined the chess moves for authenticity? Why didn't Beth's last name change when she was adopted?
