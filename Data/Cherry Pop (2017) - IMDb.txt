It's about a newcomer struggling with being the outcast on his first night. And a legend coming to terms with life after her last night in drag. And it's about a bunch of other back-stabbing queens with their own problems who just plain can't stand each other. Even the stories of some of the patrons play a part in the chaos. Cherry Pop is a real-time roller coaster ride where you better be strapped up, tucked in, and ready to go! dragdrag queenlgbtdrag racecamp1 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Time to Untuck!

This movie is just boring.There are not risks at stake. There are not characters to root for. Nothing interesting happen. This movie doesn't offer anything creative or good. It's not entertaining, so if you consider this movie and you think that maybe could be good. Well, it's not. helpful•3 4 edicionccq Nov 20, 2019 Details Edit Release date September 22, 2017 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Official Facebook Official Twitter Language English Also known as Черри Поп See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 19 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 Related news Hulu New Releases: August 2021 Aug 1Den of Geek Hulu in February: Here’s Everything Coming and Going Jan 21The Wrap Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Cherry Pop (2017) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
