Emphasis is also placed on several inside story episodes, where events are covered which occurred inside Germany and Japan such as resistance to Hitler, life in general under a dictatorial regime, and particular emphasis is focused on the Jewish Holocaust. —Anthony Hughes <husnock31@hotmail.com> war propagandasoldierworld war two soldiermilitary operationfailed military strategy132 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Genres Documentary History War Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Albert Speer's testimony in the series is now considered highly unreliable. Speer considerably downplayed his involvement in Nazi atrocities. After his death a letter he wrote in December 1971 proved he had full knowledge of the Holocaust throughout its course, despite his repeated public denials. Connections Edited into Screenwipe: Episode #3.1 (2007) User reviews103 Review Top review 10/10 Of unmatched significance in the library of video productions This series, produced at probably the most propitious time following the events of the second World War, is on a scale of value that stands far above any individual's presumption to criticize. The timing of World at War's production in 1974, amounting to some three decades after the events of the war, permits an accurate relating of events in a manner uncoloured by residual propaganda and slant. The passage of thirty years allows the telling to be backed up by an impressive and fascinating panoply of the very individuals involved, ranging from some of the highest military and political figures down to the field soldiers, civilians, and such survivors of the death camps as have remained to bear witness to the unimaginable inhumanities of which civilized humans are capable. Most approaching or well into their senior years, the interviewed subjects have had enough time to reflect on their experiences and in most instances have had enough time for whatever propaganda and fervor may have affected them in the past to have receded away, leaving only the memories of what they saw and what they did. The information that these survivors give, strikingly reinforced by the postures and expressions they display while telling their part, give their stories all the more impact. Such names as Ira Eaker, Adolph Galland, Louis Mountbatten, Albert Speer, Gertrude Junge (Hitler's personal secretary)... the list is far too long to relate. Today, within the lifetime of the survivors of this enormous lesson in the hideous price of political ambition, are young people who chant the same sort of militaristic and nationalistic war promotion as led to WW2. The DVD series we discuss here ought to comprise the core of a mandatory history subject in schools, that the lessons bought at such a horrible cost in those days should not have been wasted but should be taken to heart by those who did not see firsthand the terrible price. I am almost done watching the 11 disk set, having seen most of the series when a local TV channel aired it more than 10 years ago. It has lost none of its poignancy to me, indeed has become even more of a magnificent chronicle of some of the very darkest days of human times. The highest possible rating seems unworthy of being applied to this presentation. I think the value of this series is beyond counting. helpful•176 7 choatelodge Jan 22, 2005 Details Edit Release date October 31, 1973 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Languages English German French Japanese Also known as Die Welt im Krieg Production companies Imperial War Museum Thames Television See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 52 minutes Color Black and White Color Sound mix Mono Aspect ratio 1.33 : 1 Related news Hear Ozzy Osbourne’s First Solo Track in Almost a Decade, ‘Under the Graveyard’ Nov 8Rollingstone.com Second world war winners and the appeal of Dad’s Army | Letters Oct 10The Guardian - TV News Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was The World at War (1973) officially released in Mexico?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
