Genres Comedy Music Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Somewhere in every episode of the second season, the same man can be seen intensely dancing "The Robot". He is Karl Lake, set dresser for the show. In the first season, he was asked to be in a crowd scene and do something funny. Chappelle liked the dance Lake was doing and made it a fixture of the second season. Goofs Lil' Jon's (played by Dave Chappelle) right sleeve changes positions when he is in the doctor's office. Quotes Rick James: I'm Rick James, bitch! Crazy credits Episode #204 began with the following disclaimer: "This episode of Chappelle's Show has been deemed more offensive than usual. Viewer discretion is advised." This was followed by a second screen: "Enjoy yourself, bitches. It's a celebration." Alternate versions Club skit of the "Life in Slow motion" sketch, which was shown in second season, features a different music on DVD, as well as on syndication; probably due to legal issues.

I know I've already commented on this show but I just feel like commenting on it again. I keep thinking but the writing for this show is genius! The cast is talented (especially Dave!) Dave can do an impression of (I'm sure) any celebrity! Donnel Rawlings is talented, Mooney is talented, Charlie Murphy is talented. If you haven't seen Chappelle's Show you don't know what you're missing out on! It is probably one of the best sketch comedy shows ever. It would be a real shame if Dave finally decided not to come back for a 3rd season... The show has everything , though...great cast, great sketches, great guests, great musical guests! If you haven't seen the show then damn! Get out there and watch it!!! helpful•33 5 gluba2000 Jul 31, 2004 FAQ10 Is that Asian woman Dave's wife? Is the kid that plays his son really his son? I heard that Clayton Bigsby was based on Dave's grandfather? Is this true?
