Her deceased father wrote in his will that she would inherit the property worth 750 crores after she is no longer legally a minor - at the age of 21. The entire property is under the care-taking of Bhavani Prasad, who wants to inherit the entire property by killing her. As he hatches the plans to eliminate Malliswari, she is sent to Vizag to a relative's place as a normal girl so that she can live with anonymity. Prasad works as bank accountant in Andhra Bank at Vizag. He is a bachelor who has been desperately seeking for marriage alliance for the past seven years. He would be looking at every unmarried girl with dreams in his eyes. Just call him 'Pellikaani Prasad' and he would get instantly irritated. He accidentally meets Malliswari and falls deeply in love with her. Malliswari is traced by the goons in Vizag and they start running after her. Prasad escorts her and drops her safely in Hyderabad. To know what happened next, you must watch Malliswari on a big screen. —Anonymous character name as titleone word titlepropertybank accountantmarriage4 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines The Princess Genres Comedy Romance Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia Despite it being only her second film and the fact that her performance had to be dubbed over since she doesn't speak Telugu, Katrina Kaif was paid the highest ever salary for an actress in a South Indian film at the time, with seven million rupees for her work. Connections References Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) User reviews1 Review Top review 10/10 Laugh Riot This movie is the best comedy film watched by me in the recent times. There is not a single boring moment in the film. Venkatesh plays his role with ease and carried the film on his shoulders. Probably this is the best comedy movie by Venkatesh. Brahmanandam and Sunil also did their roles really well. Kota is excellent in the Villain character. Katrina Kaif is just OK. Rest of the characters did justice to their roles. Excellent dialogues penned by Trivikram Srinivas and a great direction by K. Vijay Bhaskhar. This movie along with Nuvve Kavali, Nuvvu Naaku Nachhav and Manmadhudu were the best movies made by Trivikram-Vijay Bhaskar. helpful•6 0 srini_unl Jan 17, 2010 Details Edit Release date February 18, 2004 (India) Country of origin India Languages Telugu English Also known as The Princess Production company Suresh Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 2 hours 30 minutes Color Color Related news ‘Duck Dynasty’ Star Sadie Robertson Huff Returns To Screen With ‘Life Just Got Real’ Scripted Series; Brad Krevoy Producing May 7Deadline Film + TV Space Force Renewed for Season 2 at Netflix, Will Get 'Creative Revamp' Nov 13TVLine.com Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Malliswari (2004) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Most anticipated Indian movies and shows Percentage shows amount of top page views. 1Marakkar: Lion of the Arabian Sea41.7% 2Ram Asur19.6% 3Bunty Aur Babli 28.2% 4RRR6.6% 5Antim: The Final Truth5.7% 6Satyameva Jayate 24.3% 7Pushpa: The Rise - Part 14.2% 8Matsya Kaand3.7% 9Minnal Murali3.4% 10Dangerous2.7% Updates approximately every 20 minutes.
