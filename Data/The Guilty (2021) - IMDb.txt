Director Antoine Fuqua also did his best with the screenplay he had, and created the perfect amount of non-stop tension and suspense - also due to Jake Gyllenhaal's outstanding performance. The cinematography and score were also on point, and the 90 min runtime and pacing just right. But the story itself was just nothing spectacular and easily forgettable - and written better in other 911 films. There were also too many plot and technical issues, and unrealistic actions and procedures taken by both the police and 911 operators. It's a generous 7/10 from me. helpful•41 26 Top_Dawg_Critic Sep 16, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 1, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Official Netflix Language English Also known as Tổng Đài Truy Vết Filming locations MBS Media Campus - 1600 Rosecrans Avenue, Manhattan Beach, California, USA Production companies Amet Entertainment Bold Films Capstone Pictures See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 30 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 2.39 : 1 Related news Kristen Stewart, Jamie Dornan, Mahershala Ali Honor Crew Members at Hamilton Awards Nov 14Variety Film + TV Jake Gyllenhaal eyed for ‘Road House’ remake Nov 11HeyUGuys.co.uk Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What was the official certification given to The Guilty (2021) in Japan?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
