Over the course of six weeks in the summer of 1969, just one hundred miles south of Woodstock, The Harlem Cultural Festival was filmed in Mount Morris Park (now Marcus Garvey Park). The footage was never seen and largely forgotten-until now. SUMMER OF SOUL shines a light on the importance of history to our spiritual well-being and stands as a testament to the healing power of music during times of unrest, both past and present. The feature includes never-before-seen concert performances by Stevie Wonder, Nina Simone, Sly and the Family Stone, Gladys Knight and the Pips, Mahalia Jackson, B.B. King, The 5th Dimension and more. —Searchlight Pictures reference to the moon landingoutdoor concertmount morris park harlem manhattan new york cityreference to the black panthersculture17 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Documentary Music Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for some disturbing images, smoking and brief drug material. Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The Harlem Cultural Festival comprised six concerts that took place between June 29 and August 24, 1969, in Marcus Garvey Park (at the time, Mount Morris Park), and attracted a combined in-person audience of 300,000. Quotes Sly Stone: Don't wait for approval from your neighbor, because your neighbor might be waiting for you. Crazy credits There is a scene after the end credits featuring Stevie Wonder and his band leader bantering back and forth on stage.
