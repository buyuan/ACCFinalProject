Genres Action Comedy Romance Certificate Passed Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia When Buster Keaton is running along the roofs of the moving freight train cars, he comes to the last one and jumps and grabs the tube connected to a water tower. His weight caused the tube to descend and, as it did so, water poured out and washed him on to the track with force, fracturing his neck nearly to the point of breaking it. This footage appears in the released film. Keaton suffered from blinding migraines for years afterwards and was unaware of the reason, until a doctor diagnosed him in the 1930s. Goofs After Sherlock Jr. spins the fence around, placing his pursuers behind it, he puts a crossbar across the gate to stop them from coming back. In the next shot, as he leaves the alley, the crossbar is no longer visible on the fence. Quotes Projectionist: [as Sherlock Jr., riding on the handlebars of a motorcycle, unaware the driver fell off] Be careful or one of us will get hurt. Alternate versions In 1995, Film Preservation Associates, Inc. copyrighted a 45-minute version of this film, with a music score performed by Vince Giordano and The Nighthawks. Connections Edited into When Comedy Was King (1960) User reviews336 Review Top review 10/10 A World of Possibilities Not only is this Buster Keaton's best film, but it is among the greatest achievements in the history of cinema, period. While it is not a feature-length film--and thus barred from most critics' lists of great films--it invented just about every single basic special effect known to movies (except for morphing). The story itself, about a film projectionist who desires to become part of the movies, and then does, by walking right onto the screen, made palpable the desire that we all have to be in the movies: To get the girl, to be an action hero, to outsmart the bad guys. Keaton invented meta-cinema before anyone even had a phrase for it. This movie has entered our dreams. helpful•51 9 up2u Mar 5, 2006 Details Edit Release date May 11, 1924 (United States) Country of origin United States Languages None English Also known as 福尔摩斯二世 Filming locations 3630 Pasadena Ave, Los Angeles, California, USA Production company Buster Keaton Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross US & Canada $977,375 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 45 minutes Color Black and White Sound mix Silent Aspect ratio 1.33 : 1 Related news An Ode To Movie Theaters In Movies [Be Reel Podcast] May 30The Playlist A Sherlock Junior Movie is Being Planned at Netflix Oct 20TVovermind.com Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Japanese language plot outline for Sherlock Jr. (1924)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
