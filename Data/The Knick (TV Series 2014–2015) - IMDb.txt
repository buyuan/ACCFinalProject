Every day they must deal with lack of funding, personal conflicts, egotism, racial tensions, personal vices, drug addiction, affairs, closed minds, dated nigh-medieval medical techniques and them and their experimental new techniques being misunderstood by most, in order to keep the hospital going and give the ill the help they need. The pressure is enormous and leaves its mark on the souls of most of them. 1900ssurgeondoctorhospitalsurgery7 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Modern medicine had to start somewhere. (Season 1) Genres Drama History Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Dr. Algernon Edwards is partially based on Louis T. Wright (1891 - 1952), a brilliant African American surgeon who was active in the New York NAACP in the first half of the 20th century. Both Wright and the fictional Edwards studied at Harvard Medical School and graduated at the top of their class. Wright became Harlem Hospital's first African American surgeon in 1921, two decades after this show takes place. Connections Featured in The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon: Clive Owen/Nina Dobrev/The Head & the Heart (2014) User reviews88 Review Top review 10/10 Can't get enough! I cannot get enough of this show, it is extraordinary in so many ways and I am restlessly awaiting the start of season 2. As a long time health care professional, I especially enjoy all of the "modern technology" of the era, that today we just take for granted. The Knick really does have something for everyone - sex, drugs and a rock star chief of staff, to name a few. I like to describe this show as a health care history lesson, on a massive dose of steroids. The peak into the medical and clinical protocols of the day are just as intriguing as the systemic administrative practices that are questionable at best. I only wish more people knew about The Knick so I could discuss each week's episode over and over again. Hurry up with season 2! helpful•39 3 pamsaffire Oct 19, 2014 FAQ1 Why in the world did this great show not carry on with more seasons and episodes. It is a great show and should be brought back for many more seasons.
