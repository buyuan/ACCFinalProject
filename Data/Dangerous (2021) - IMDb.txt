Meanwhile, a band of armed mercenaries wants something Dylan's brother was hiding, and Dylan will need all his cunning and tactical skills to survive. —Frank Liesenborgs violencer ratedex conlithiumbreaking point70 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Killer instincts don't expire Genres Action Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for violence and language Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia Filming shut down for lack of funding, according to 2/28/15 reports. Goofs When the sheriff opens the box of medication and throws one tablet into Dylan's mouth, the box of medication is opened obviously. Then Jo walks in and you can clearly see that the box of medication is closed (although the box has not been touched). And 10 seconds later when Jo is pouring coffee for Dylan and the sheriff, you can see that the box of medication is open again. This is easy to spot as the box is orange and the cap is white. Quotes Sheriff McCoy: So who did you kill? Dylan 'D' Forrester: Oh, you have to be a little more specific User reviews39 Review Top review 7/10 Predictable? So what? just enjoy You will love the dialogues between the main characters Yes, "Dangerous" is predictable. So what? If you are well tuned in and listen to the dialogues between Scott Eastwood (D), his eccentric psychiatrist (Mel Gibson) and Destiny Millns (Jo), you will really enjoy this movie. Scott Eastwood, for his part, plays D as apathetic as possible, sounding more and more like his father. Outstanding acting from Mel Gibson (has been a while....) and Destiny Millns (Jo). You can also see and feel the chemistry in the dialogues between these three characters. The movie is missing a couple of things and therefore will not be well received by the audience. That´s my guess. But I think that whatever this movie might be missing is made up by the dialogues. I found the dialogues catchy, really well written and executed. And do not forget that there´s a little plot twist at the end. Forget prejudice and have a go! Watch and you will enjoy. helpful•18 17 frank-liesenborgs Nov 5, 2021 Details Edit Release date November 5, 2021 (Poland) Country of origin United States Official site Official site Language English Also known as Wake Filming locations Cleveland, Ohio, USA Production companies Minds Eye Entertainment Benaroya Pictures Falconer Pictures See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $8,000,000 (estimated) See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 39 minutes Color Color Related news ‘No Time to Die’ Sweeps VOD Charts as Netflix Originals Dominate the Streamer’s Top 10 Nov 15Indiewire CMA Awards 2021: The Complete Winners List Nov 11Rollingstone.com Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Canadian French language plot outline for Dangerous (2021)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
