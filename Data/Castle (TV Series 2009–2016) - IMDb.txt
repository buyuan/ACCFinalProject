He teams up with New York police detective Kate Beckett to solve the case. He finds inspiration in Detective Beckett and starts shadowing her for his next book. female detectivenew york cityhomicide investigationnovelistcrime writer55 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines A whole new chapter in crime solving. (Season 1) Genres Comedy Crime Drama Mystery Romance Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The actress who plays Ryan's wife in the show, Juliana Dever, is Seamus Dever's (Ryan's) real life wife. Goofs We see Castle constantly ask the detectives working with him (or the detectives themselves) to put out APB's (All Points Bulletins) or BOLOs (Be On the Look Out) to bring suspects and witnesses in. When found the New York City Police brings them to the station for the Detectives and Castle to interview even though it's pretty clear they didn't want to come. If there is no probable cause for an arrest or an active arrest warrant, the police can't make you go anywhere against your will. Once in a while, a wealthy or educated person will assert this and ask a lawyer to be present but this is rare. Quotes [repeated season 2 episode open] Richard Castle: [v.o] There are two kinds of folks who sit around thinking about how to kill people: psychopaths and mystery writers. I'm the kind that pays better. Who am I? Richard Castle: I'm Rick Castle. Richard Castle: Castle. Richard Castle: Castle. Richard Castle: I really am ruggedly handsome, aren't I? Richard Castle: [v.o] Every writer needs inspiration, and I found mine. Kate Beckett: Detective Kate Beckett. Kate Beckett: Beckett. Kate Beckett: Beckett. Kate Beckett: Nikki Heat? Martha Rodgers: The character he's basing on you. Richard Castle: [v.o] And thanks to my friendship with the Mayor, I get to be on her case. Richard Castle: I'd be happy to let you spank me. Richard Castle: [v.o] And together we catch killers. Richard Castle: We make a pretty good team, you know. Like Starsky and Hutch, Turner and Hooch. Kate Beckett: You do remind me a little of Hooch. Connections Featured in The Wright Stuff: Episode #15.115 (2011) User reviews203 Review Top review 9/10 Nathan is in his element!!! For anyone of the "Firefly" persuasion, you are in for a treat! ABC realized what a gem they had in Nathan Fillion when he did his guest stint on Desperate Housewives, and they quickly got their act together and gave him a series! In other words, Nathan is back!! :) This series has a great start to it, with a strong ensemble cast that brings out a great multi-dimensional quality to the show. It is clever, and sarcastic humor reigns. The plot of the pilot was your typical Crime Investigation approach, but it is the delivery of this fine cast that breaks it apart from other shows. With that being said, I hope that they do develop the story lines a bit better in the future, but no matter what happens, this show is a joy to watch simply because of the cast...especially Nathan Fillion. This character is very much like Mal Reynolds in Firefly, and that is what brought me to this show. The rest of the cast and the great delivery is what will keep me with this show!! Well done ABC!! helpful•110 22 PHeath60 Mar 15, 2009 FAQ1 Where can I find out what song played during an episode?
