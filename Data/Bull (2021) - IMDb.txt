Plot summary Add synopsis Genre Thriller Parents guide Add content advisory User reviews3 Review Top review 6/10 Decent film, marred by bizarre ending. Saw this at the London Film Festival premiere last night. It's a well-made and engaging low-budget crime film, with excellent acting and music. Neil Maskell and David Hayman give dependably good performances. It's very much along the lines of Dead Man's Shoes and Kill List, although lacking the flair, originality and imagination of those classics. Hard geezer seeks revenge, with over-the-top violence and nasty, humourless working-class gangsters. A grim and dour tone. Some nicely choreographed stabbings and gunshots. It's nothing new, but it does it satisfactorily and holds your attention. It's a great shame then that the film is almost fatally marred by a bizarre and poorly thought-through conclusion that had to make me wonder why not a single person on the team of this production said 'um, hang on a minute, are we really going with this ending..?'. It's just wrong for the tone of the film. I can see what they were aiming for, as it's been done before in one of the best crime films ever made, but here they mess it up by not setting it up correctly, and in the process almost wreck a perfectly workable film. All in all, despite this flaw, this is worth a watch, as it is undeniably entertaining. helpful•3 5 stereosteve-1 Oct 17, 2021 Details Edit Release date November 5, 2021 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Language English Production companies Giant Productions Tea Shop Productions Signature Films See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 28 minutes Color Color Related news Signature Adds Paul Andrew Williams Thriller ‘Bull’ To Sales & Distribution Slate, Neil Maskell & David Hayman Star Jul 19Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Spanish language plot outline for Bull (2021)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
