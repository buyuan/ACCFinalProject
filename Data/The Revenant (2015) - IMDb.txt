When his hunting team leaves him for dead, Glass must utilize his survival skills to find a way back home while avoiding natives on their own hunt. Grief-stricken and fueled by vengeance, Glass treks through the wintry terrain to track down John Fitzgerald, the former confidant who betrayed and abandoned him. —Jwelch5742 survivalbear attackleft to diefurbased on true story347 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines (n. One who has returned, as if from the dead.) Genres Action Adventure Drama History Western Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for strong frontier combat and violence including gory images, a sexual assault, language and brief nudity Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Shot chronologically on an 80-day schedule that took place over a total principal photography time period of nine months. This unusually long production time was due to the cold weather conditions, the remoteness of the locations and director Alejandro G. Iñárritu's and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki's aesthetic plan to shoot only with natural light for maximum realism. Only a few shooting hours were available every day and had to be carefully planned in advance. Goofs Glass is attacked by a grizzly bear with her two cubs. But the film is set at a time of year when a grizzly bear (especially a mother bear with cubs) would be in hibernation: early- to mid-winter. We know this is the time of year because of the weather, and the drinking scene midway through the film, when Captain Henry says to Fitzgerald, "Happy New Year." The real-life Hugh Glass was mauled by a mother bear around May, 1823 - a time of year when bears are far less likely to be in hibernation. Quotes Hugh Glass: As long as you can still grab a breath, you fight. You breathe... keep breathing. Crazy credits At the end of the end credits: "The making and authorized distribution of this film supported over 15,000 jobs and involved hundreds of thousands of work hours."

It just isnt! It's a hell of a good movie with good acting, great characters, great script. Tom Hardy should had won the oscar for this... Totally recomend it!!! helpful•17 3 ruivasconcelosgps Aug 27, 2020 FAQ7 Is this based on true events? Is 'The Revenant' based on a book?
