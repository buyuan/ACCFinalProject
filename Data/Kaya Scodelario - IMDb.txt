Personal Quote: I've never been interested in playing just the boring pretty girl, because I've never met a boring pretty girl. Every woman I've ever met has been interesting and flawed and damaged and strong and beautiful and reckless and everything in between. I've never met a two-dimensional woman, so I'd never want to play one, because it's just not realistic to me. It doesn't exist.
