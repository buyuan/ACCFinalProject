Connections Referenced in The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon: Ice Cube/Ryan Seacrest/Action Bronson (2017) User reviews30 Review Top review 9/10 "Sometimes, you need to be indulged." This dual narrative about a Brooklyn pit-bull of a record mogul (Iovine) and one of the most successful rapers-cum-producers-cum-engineers-cum-executives/directors in the game, is the most stylish (and best) episode of Behind the Music ever made, and then some. It's excitingly produced, kinetic, edited so that it's taking the usual taking heads with editing that will often play one head against another (this is extremely helpful due to the business dealings with Iovine and Interscope that could become dense too), and how music flows through this with a rhythm and juxtapositions that cant be touched. I was also very impressed not just by finding out things I didn't know (frankly outside of Iovine with Springsteen on Born to Run I didn't know much about his career at Interscope), but the scope: this isn't only about Dr. Dre but the entire WORLD around him that he got into and loved at times and hated at others (he left Death Row before that imploded, so to speak). It reminds me of digging in to a really strong biography more than a typical doc. Oh, and it's funny at times too (Snoop catches you off guard sometimes). I'm waiting for Primus's doc though.. PS: did Dre become the Kubrick of rap? helpful•9 4 Quinoa1984 Oct 27, 2017 Details Edit Release date July 9, 2017 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Official Instagram Official site Language English Also known as Những Người Dám Thách Thức Production companies Alcon Entertainment Silverback 5150 Pictures See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour Color Color Aspect ratio 1.78 : 1 Related news Taiki Waititi, Jessica Chastain, Tiffany Haddish Star in HollyShorts Film Festival Selections – Film News in Brief Aug 30Variety Film + TV Film Academy Museum’s Lobby to Be Named for Sidney Poitier Aug 30The Wrap Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What was the official certification given to The Defiant Ones (2017) in the United Kingdom?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
