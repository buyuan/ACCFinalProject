Can he find the terrorist in time and save everyone? —rcs0411@yahoo.com die hard scenariopassengermind gamedeceptionsuspense184 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines The Hijacking Was Just the Beginning Genres Action Mystery Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of action and violence, some language, sensuality and drug references Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The set for the plane was built slightly larger than a standard commercial airliner, to accommodate Neeson's 6'4" height for filming. According to Neeson, over 90% of the shoot occurred in this 'plane' over a two-week period. Goofs In the beginning, when Bill Marks visits the cockpit, you see the power levers of a 4 engine airplane. However, the all exterior shot of the airplane show the plane has 2 engines only. Quotes [from trailer] Bill Marks: I hate flying. The lines. The crowds. The delays... Jen Summers: I always kinda liked it. Six hours. One seat. Nobody can get to you. Crazy credits The first part of the end credits is displayed in the fashion of the arrival/departure boards using flipped panels.

Courtesy of Sound System Recordings User reviews479 Review Top review 8/10 Non-stop thrills and suspense! This is an action-thriller starring Liam Neeson as U.S. Air Marshal Bill Marks who, while boarding a flight to London, receives text messages from an unknown assailant, threatening that if he doesn't transfer $150 million to an account, a fatality will occur on the plane every 20 minutes unless Marks complies with the money request. The film starts off with some intrigue, showing Marks depressed, consuming alcohol and having a couple of run-ins with some passengers before he boards the plane, already giving the audience the impression that Marks is a disturbed person and making us eager to know what his background story is. Jen Summers (Julianne Moore) sits next to Marks on the plane, whose background story is also a mystery until later on in the film, providing us with another interesting subplot. However, the main plot and action come almost immediately after the plane takes to the air when Marks starts receiving the threatening text messages. What follows is a suspenseful game of cat and mouse as Marks attempt to find the perpetrator and, when the casualties start to mount, it becomes a thrilling roller-coaster ride. The screenwriter team wrote an exhilarating story that really captures the audience attention from start to finish and Jaume Collet-Serra directed a solid plot that kept the movie's pace going strong, leaving no room with unnecessary fillers that tends to drag the story. There are a few camp and corny moments here and there, but the acting was realistic and believable enough to keep the movie dramatic and engaging. Overall, it's a great action film that is full of twists and turns that will make you glued to the screen and have you guessing the unpredictable outcomes. Highly recommended.
