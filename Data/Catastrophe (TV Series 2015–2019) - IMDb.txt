(uncredited) Performed by Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats User reviews113 Review Top review 9/10 Catastrophe is anything but My wife, 41, and I, 45, love Gavin and Stacey, largely due to the fine writing and interesting character development of the show's supporting players, Ruth Jones and James Corden. Catastrophe, on the other hand, stays with its leads -- thank goodness -- through an abbreviated six-episode opening season, and we're both hooked. Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney star in this frank and funny look at two generally kind-hearted adults in London. One's a frustrated Irish school teacher; the other's a knuckle-headed American ad executive. They hook up, then team up, after Horgan's Sharon Morris is knocked up by Delaney's Rob Norris during a week-long sex slog. That this odd, endearing couple is surrounded and supported almost completely by assholes is just part of their troubles, and it's a flaw that must be addressed if this Catastrophe is going to grow. Indeed, it's almost solely to the daffy duo's credit, both on screen and as co-writers, that the show avoids the mean-spirited ditch lurking around each episode's next twisted turn. The serious events Sharon and Rob stumble through -- often based on the personal experiences of 45-year-old Horgan and 38-year-old Delaney - - are handled delicately or bluntly as warranted. But it's the honesty of the leads, who riotously portray two human beings with big mouths and big hearts, that's so attractive. We look forward to their next Catastrophe. helpful•34 9 NHLiptak Jun 22, 2015 Details Edit Release date January 19, 2015 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Official sites Official Site Official site Language English Also known as 大禍臨頭 Production companies Avalon Television Birdbath Productions Merman See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 24 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 1.78 : 1 Related news Shining Vale: Courteney Cox's Horror Comedy to Premiere in March on Starz Nov 16TVLine.com Hello, Master Chief: Paramount+ Releases First Teaser For “Halo”- Series Stars Pablo Schreiber And Natascha McElhone Nov 15WeAreMovieGeeks.com Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Brazilian Portuguese language plot outline for Catastrophe (2015)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
