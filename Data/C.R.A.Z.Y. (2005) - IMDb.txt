Zac feels somewhat disconnected to his brothers, all of whom are different from each other. They include the bookworm Christian who is the eldest, the dumb jock Antoine who is third, and the youngest Yvan. But Zac has the most contempt for his second eldest brother, the shiftless druggie Raymond. To his devout Catholic mother, Zac is her miracle son, both for being born the same day as Jesus Christ (a fact which Zac has always hated), and because a Tupperware-selling mystic once told her that he has the power to heal. Laurianne has always coddled Zac, the two who have a special if unspoken bond. But Zac wants more to please his father, who wants more than anything in his sons that they grow up to be man's men and not sissies. As Zac goes through his mid-teens to early twenties, Zac isn't sure if he can live up to the ideals of either his mother or especially his father. A young man with stress-induced asthma, Zac just wants to be what he considers normal, which includes getting rid of his asthma. But more importantly, he wants to get rid of the underlying thoughts that he has and which most going through puberty have, but that for him are becoming more prevalent as he grows older. —Huggo punctuation in titlegay brothercloseted homosexualdeath by overdosedrug overdose328 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Growing up in this family, you'd have to be... C.R.A.Z.Y. Genres Comedy Drama Certificate Not Rated Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia This was the official Canadian entry for the "Best Foreign Language Film" category at the 2005 Academy Awards, but it did not end up as one of the five foreign language films to be nominated. Goofs Just after hearing Pink Floyd's "Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Part One)" and the Rolling Stones' "Sympathy for the Devil", we see several music albums, and among them is Pink Floyd's "Animals". The scene is supposed to be occurring in 1975, and "Animals" was released in 1977. Quotes Zachary Beaulieu 15 à 21 ans: I want to be like everyone else. Madame Chose: Thank God, you never will. Crazy credits The end titles finish showing the first names of the five sons in capital letters in the order of birth: Christian . Raymond . Antoine . Zacharie . Yvan . Then all the letters dissolve, with the exception of each first letters, thus creating (and explaining) the title of the film: C.R.A.Z.Y.

C.R.A.Z.Y. is simply one of the best movies of all time. It encapsulates a time and a place  Quebec in the sixties, seventies and eighties and evokes the era with an amazing sound track and jaw-dropping acting. You're there, in the moment with Gervais, played by Michel Côté who is the macho factory-working Dad. He's the proud father of five sons but gradually realizes that one of them is a 'sissy' and takes this on personally in the jock world he inhabits. The father is a fully rounded character, not cast in the black and white mold so prevalent in other movies of this genre as his puzzled love for his fourth son Zac, played by Marc-André Grondin, is palpable. The movie takes off in completely unexpected directions. Zac is totally uncomfortable with his sexuality and prays all the time for a 'cure'. He just wants to be like his brothers and earn the love and acceptance of his father. It is telling that for Gervais, he can accept his druggie son but not the one he suspects of being a 'fairy'. There is a huge amount of humour in the movie, one scene in the cathedral with the boys' choir singing "Sympathy for the Devil" brought a joyful laughter to the audience I was in. It is that kind of movie. Gervais sings Charles Aznevour's hits with predicable regularity and has a thing for Patsy Cline and her music. It is the era when everything was changing and insular Quebec, like the rest of the world, was being exposed to the outside world of David Bowie and Jefferson Airplane. Zac embraces all of these changes and struggles with his orientation. Nothing is ever graphically portrayed, the plot is character driven all the way with incredible little sidelines and sidebars thrown in to add to the concoction. (One scene of a drunken brawl played to a beautiful opera piece comes to mind.) Danielle Proulx, who portrays the mother, does not have much dialogue (typical of the era) but when she does speak it packs a wallop. She has a wonderful scene with Gervais where they discuss anal sex and a couple of others where her psychic ties to her son Zac are evident but never discussed. The film just gets under your skin, you are there, in that microcosm of time when the world was changing so drastically and we just didn't know it. 9 out of 10. Take a bow Jean-Marc Vallée; you have an absolutely amazing talent! Bravo to the entire cast and crew. Movies are a pleasure when they're this special, and yes, I would see it again. helpful•85 9 wisewebwoman Nov 18, 2005 Details Edit Release date March 3, 2006 (Italy) Countries of origin Canada Morocco Official site the official trailer on YouTube Languages French English German Spanish Polish Also known as Crazy Filming locations Essaouira, Morocco Production companies Attraction Images Cirrus Communications Crazy Films See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget CA$6,500,000 (estimated) Gross worldwide $3,710,169 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 2 hours 9 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Psych 3 Was About Getting to 'The Longest Scene We've Ever Done, and It's Going to Be Bonkers' Nov 17TVLine.com Watch Psych 3's First 4 Minutes: An Empanada-rrito Ruins Lassie's Moment Nov 16TVLine.com Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was C.R.A.Z.Y.
