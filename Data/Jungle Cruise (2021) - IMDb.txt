Dreaming about saving countless lives and having another adventure, the feisty English feminist and doctor of botany, Dr Lily Houghton, embarks on a peril-laden mission to change the world. Along with her fashionable brother, MacGregor, Dr Houghton enlists the help of the arrogant, wisecracking riverboat skipper, Captain Frank Wolff, to guide them through the serpentine Amazon River in La Quila, his swift wooden boat. Now, as the intrepid trio ventures deeper and deeper into the heart of an impenetrable green maze, searching for something that cannot be found, a centuries-old curse and the ruthless aristocrat, Prince Joachim, threaten to put an end to their ambitious plans. And, sooner or later, the jungle always wins. Is it true that the Spanish conquistador, Don Aguirre, was lost in the same God-forsaken part of the world? —Nick Riganas jungleboatsnakeamazon rainforestamazon jungle76 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Genres Action Adventure Comedy Fantasy Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for sequences of adventure violence Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Many of the puns Frank uses are taken directly from the Disney Parks attraction on which the ride is based. These "so bad they're good" jokes are one of the reasons why Jungle Cruise skippers are so important to the ride experience. Goofs Prince Joachim knows where the trapped Spanish are located. There was no record of this because only Skipper knew where he trapped them. Quotes Frank Wolff: Hey, McGregor! Had a girlfriend once, she was cross-eyed. Didn't work out. We could never see eye to eye! Crazy credits The bay in the Disney logo is seen to have the water glowing purple, and after the Disney logo fully appears the camera dives into the water and leads to the Tree of Life, which opens the film. Connections Featured in AniMat's Crazy Cartoon Cast: D23 Expo 2019 Extravaganza (2019) Soundtracks Nothing Else Matters Reimagined by Metallica and James Newton Howard With featured performances by James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, Kirk Hammett, Robert Trujillo Written by James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich Associate Producer and Engineer Greg Fidelman User reviews1K Review Top review 7/10 Amazon adventure Quite good and balanced action and adventure film with mix of comedy. OK'ish background story, maybe a little too much of a fantasy side for my taste, but sure will work just fine for younger viewers. helpful•17 3 sleijeri Oct 14, 2021 FAQ2 Will 'Weird Al' Yankovic's song 'Skipper Dan' about Disney's Jungle Cruise ride be featured in this movie?
