From Harlan's disfunctional family to his devoted staff, Blanc sifts through a web of red herrings and self-serving lies to uncover the truth behind Harlan's untimely death. —Lionsgate private detectivevomitingwhodunitsuspected suicidemurder mystery653 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Everyone has a motive. No one has a clue. Genres Comedy Crime Drama Mystery Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for thematic elements including brief violence, some strong language, sexual references, and drug material Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Jacob's line "You had sex with my grandpa, you dirty anchor baby!" was improvised by Jaeden Martell, but it was originally lost in the scene since multiple characters were talking and yelling. Michael Shannon noticed this and approached Rian Johnson, telling him that Martell had a killer line, so they made sure to go back and capture it. Goofs When Marta goes over Mr. Thrombey's drug regimen, she states that he injured his shoulder about a week ago. Therefore, she is giving him 100 mg of Toradol followed by 3 mg of Morphine for sleep. Toradol is only given in doses of 15 mg/ml or 30 mg/ml. In addition, one isn't supposed to give more than 60 mg/ml in a single dose. In addition, it should only be given for five days or less. Quotes Benoit Blanc: It's a weird case from the start. A case with a hole in the center. A doughnut. Crazy credits At the very end of the credits dogs can be heard barking. Connections Featured in CTV News at Six Toronto: Episode dated 7 September 2019 (2019) Soundtracks The Inspector Written and Performed by Tal Bergman User reviews2.7K Review Top review 8/10 Hated Last Jedi. Loved this. As a fan of mysteries (Sherlock Holmes, Poirot, Columbo, Monk, Psych.etc.) I was thrilled to see someone making a classic style whodunnit...and the cast! Figure you can't go wrong. Well I enjoyed it & while the cast all have time to shine it is Daniel Craig with his Southern drawl & especially Ana de Armas that steal the show. For anyone keeping away because they hated The Last Jedi...I agree, it was my least favourite of all the Star Wars films, but this is a well written film that was well acted and I can only hope this will inspire others to reinvigorate the murder mystery genre. helpful•509 284 tcasavecchia Dec 1, 2019 FAQ21 How did Marta get the blood spot on her shoe? She was outside of the room when Harlan killed himself? Is there significance in Blanc's use of pressing the piano key? Is it to just get the attention of the family member being interviewed? Or is he doing it specifically when they've said something important? Is the character name Harlan Thrombey an homage to the Choose Your Own Adventure book "Who Killed Harlowe Thrombey?"?
