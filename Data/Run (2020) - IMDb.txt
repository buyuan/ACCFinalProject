The filmmakers wanted to cast a disabled actress, stating that Hollywood rarely casts disabled actors for disabled roles. [Variety Magazine] Goofs As a suicide risk, Chloe should have a 1:1 sitter at all times- a staff member, or at the least, a video monitor, to make sure she doesn't try to harm herself. The room should have been cleared of any sharp objects, as well as wires, ties, cords, hospital linens, etc, that could be used to make a noose. The nurse/doctor even acknowledges this risk by not allowing Chloe to use her pen, but commits a grave error leaving her alone in the room. Quotes Chloe Sherman: I... don't... need you. Diane Sherman: You will. Connections Featured in The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon: Sarah Paulson/Henry Golding/Car Seat Headrest (2020) Soundtracks Do Me Like Performed by Beatnet Written by Brandon Stewart Courtesy of The Math Club User reviews574 Review Top review 7/10 I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. If you're looking for a thrilling and suspenseful experience, this is the right movie for you. The plot twist isn't that dramatic but the plot just keeps drawing you in. Sarah Paulson's acting is world class, and the actress who played the daughter was super convincing as well. I also loved how the scenery was complimenting the gloomy aura of this film. Highly reccommend. helpful•23 8 duongthanhvan Dec 30, 2020 FAQ3 What is the purple candy that Chloe likes? I'm guessing they're a type of chocolate.
