Sometimes something that was simple at the start, turns out to get out of control. Everything is odd in the small mountain town, South Park, and the boys always find something to do with it. coloradosatiresocial satirepolitical humorprofanity174 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Four boys. One f**ked up town. Genres Animation Comedy Certificate (Banned) Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Cartman's mom is named Liane after Trey Parker's former fiancée. He caught her with another man, and so he named the promiscuous character after her. Goofs Exactly who is related to whom in the Marsh family is never consistent. Early episodes imply that Jimbo and Marvin (Stan's grandfather) are on Sharon's side of the family, whereas more recent ones imply they are on Randy's side. Being on Sharon's side makes sense for Jimbo, as he has a different last name. However, Marvin's last name is, indeed, confirmed to be Marsh. Matt Stone revealed in an interview that Jimbo Kerns is Randy's half-brother. Quotes Cartman: I'm not fat, I'm big-boned. Stan: No, Jay Leno's chin is big-boned. You are a big fat ass.

Well, three now, with different kids rotating in and out to fill the spot that Kenny left. Matt Stone and Trey Parker are comedic geniuses. I think that people who simply brush this off as uninspired pandering to foul mouthed kids like the ones in this show aren't looking deep enough. There is actually a lot of intelligent social commentary here - it's just masked under anything they could possibly offend someone with. helpful•162 102 chthon2 May 20, 2003 FAQ36 Are Kyle's parents from Israel?
