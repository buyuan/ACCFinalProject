Connections Spun-off from The Shrink Next Door (2019) User reviews33 Review Top review Slow, true-cringe series I don't always agree with critics, but this has a 42% positive among "top professional reviewers" at rotten tomatoes, meaning most reviewers paned this. And I agree it is in the 4/10 star neighborhood. PR flacks can organize shilling of "sexists man" votes, but the can't make a mediocre series better. Rodger Ebert site panned it, as did Slant Mag, Hollywood reporter, Rolling Stone, Variety, NYTimes etc. The LA Times simply called it "Dull." My experience with this watching three episode's was that it was utterly predictable and steadily cringeworthy. Ferrell is a talent but seemed to be sleepwalking or simply not wanting to be in the series. Rudd has always played the same moderate anxiety nebbish, and does here. That is fresh for about one minute. Folks we are in the post-golden age of TV. Audiences are now used to sophisticated, quality entertainment, yet junk like this also manages to get made as well. 4/10 at best. helpful•35 28 random-70778 Nov 12, 2021 Details Edit Release date November 12, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Apple TV+ Site Language English Also known as Bác Sĩ Kế Bên Production companies Bloomberg Media Civic Center Media Gloria Sanchez Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news Link Tank: Why the MCU Needs to Embrace Comic-Accurate X-Men Costumes Nov 16Den of Geek The week in TV: The Shrink Next Door; Inside the Care Crisis With Ed Balls; Beat the Devil; The Tower Nov 14The Guardian - TV News Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was The Shrink Next Door (2021) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
