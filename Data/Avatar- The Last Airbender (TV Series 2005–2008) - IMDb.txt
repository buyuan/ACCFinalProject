The Avatar upholds the balance between the nations, but everything changed when the Fire Nation invaded. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, can stop them. But when the world needs him most, he vanishes. A hundred years later Katara and Sokka discover the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang. Together they must help Aang master the elements and save the world. —Kevin Jeremiah Gaona anime inspiredfour elementsavatarchild herohero67 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines The Avatar Returns Genres Animation Action Adventure Family Fantasy Mystery Certificate TV-Y7-FV Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Zuko was one of the last characters to be written into the show. The Fire Lord was meant to be the show's main antagonist, but the writers realized he would not be able to cause Aang and his friends trouble sitting from his throne. Zuko was then written into the show. Goofs The design of the white lotus tile changes through the course of the series : 1st in "Avatar: The Last Airbender" (2005) {The Waterbending Scroll (#1.9)}_, when Iroh holds up the tile he finds in his sleeve. 2nd in "Avatar: The Last Airbender" (2005) {The Desert (#2.11)}_, when Iroh makes the first move in the game. 3rd in "Avatar: The Last Airbender" (2005) {Sokka's Master (#3.4)}_, the tile given to Sokka by the butler more closely resembles the first design. Quotes Katara: [opening narration] Water... Earth... Fire... Air. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang. And although his airbending skills are great, he still has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe Aang can save the world. Alternate versions The Previously on Avatar... segments shown after the show's opening in most episodes were not originally included(except on occasion) until sometime in Book 2. All reruns of all episodes in the series now include those segments (even the ones that aired before the decision was permanent). Connections Featured in Cinematic Excrement: The Last Airbender (2010) User reviews772 Review Top review Avatar: The Last Airbender What a breath of fresh air (no pun intended), My boys and I were hooked after the first episode. The action sequences are great, and the lighthearted humor is refreshing...It's about time they came out with something that might become a classic. I like the animation, and the characters are right on...great idea to have the fate of the nations resting in the hands of a 12 year old boy, who wants to be a kid, but at the same time realizes he has a lot of responsibility resting on his shoulders. I hope they can keep it going and not have it break down as we get further into the season. I am looking forward to the rest of the season, and hope they put it on DVD...would like to have it in my library. helpful•151 19 rjlebaron Apr 2, 2005 FAQ10 Live Action Films Will Aang always be the last airbender?
