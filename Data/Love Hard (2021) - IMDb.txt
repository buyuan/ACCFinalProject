Genres Comedy Romance Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The film's title is a combination of Josh's favorite Christmas movie "Love Actually," and Natalie's favorite Christmas movie "Die Hard". Quotes Josh Lin: Tag, I want you to meet my cousin Natalie. And Natalie, I want you to meet my old friend Tag. Tag: You two are cousins? Natalie Bauer: Yeah. Uh. We... Well... Josh Lin: From my stepmom's side, so that would technically make us step-cousins. Tag: Oh. Natalie Bauer: A distinction that only really matters if you're from Alabama. Josh Lin: [laughs] She's such a joker. [Natalie laughs] Tag: Yeah. Walden? Natalie Bauer: Oh. Tag: That's my favorite book. I reread it every year. Natalie Bauer: Really? Tag: Yeah. Natalie Bauer: Wow. Tag: No way! Tag: [chuckles] Yeah. Isn't Thoreau the best? Natalie Bauer: Well, some people find him a self-obsessed narcissist, fanatical about self-control, not to mention a total hypocrite, but personally, I find him so inspiring. Tag: "Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth." [sighs] Tag: I'm sorry. It gets me every time. [chuckles] Natalie Bauer: If anyone gets it, it's me. Tag: God. Have we met before? Because you look so familiar. I... I just can't put my finger on it. Josh Lin: Unlikely. Natalie just flew in from California this morning. Natalie Bauer: This morning. Tag: I actually teach a survival course in Yosemite every summer. Natalie Bauer: Savage! [clears throat] Tag: I guess you could say that, yeah. Natalie Bauer: I love Yosemite. It's, uh, I mean, there's some gnar-like, gnarly climbing there. Tag: You climb? Natalie Bauer: Me? [scoffs] Natalie Bauer: Do I climb? I'll climb anything that moves. I'm an aggro. Tag: Aggro? Josh Lin: Yeah, like aggressive. Aggro. [growls] Natalie Bauer: An aggressive climber. I climb all kinds of things like ladders, um, houses, um, trees, ladders... Mostly ladders. [chuckles] Tag: That's cool. Um, a few of us are climbing at Rock Ventures tomorrow. Wanna join? Josh Lin: Hell yeah! Let's do it. Tag: Great. Natalie Bauer: Mm-hmm. Tag: 10:00 a.m.? Natalie Bauer: Perfect. Tag: Um. Well, hey, it was nice to meet you, Natalie. I'll see you guys at 10:00 a.m. Josh Lin: See you, bro. Natalie Bauer: Climb you later!

Agh... It was funny, heart-warming, well paced but the leads lacked chemistry.. I felt like Nina would have had better chemistry with the big brother. Great movie for Christmas tho! helpful•17 4 kreminal Nov 5, 2021 Details Edit Release date November 5, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Netflix Site Language English Also known as الحبّ الصعب Filming locations Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada Production company Wonderland Sound and Vision See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 44 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Related news ‘No Time to Die’ Sweeps VOD Charts as Netflix Originals Dominate the Streamer’s Top 10 Nov 15Indiewire Five Love Lessons from Netflix’s Romantic Comedy, “Love Hard” Nov 14TVovermind.com Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What was the official certification given to Love Hard (2021) in Japan?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
