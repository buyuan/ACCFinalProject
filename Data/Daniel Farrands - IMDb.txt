Personal Quote: Although he's a boogeyman, Jason [Voorhees] was a nerd who was abused and left behind. He suffered this horrible tragedy, and when he came back to life he couldn't be stopped. There's a wish fulfillment there for a lot of kids. By killing off the cool kids, he speaks to people who feel alienated. Not that you wish people dead, but it's a way for some people to live out their strangest fantasies. ...
