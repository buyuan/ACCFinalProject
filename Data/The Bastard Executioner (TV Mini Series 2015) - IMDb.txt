But when that violence finds him again, he is forced to pick up the bloodiest sword of all. —Zack Graham tv mini series14th century Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Action Drama History Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Being filmed at Dragon Studios (Vallywood) in Llanharan, South Wales. Connections Referenced in The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon: Drew Barrymore/Stephen Moyer/5 Seconds of Summer (2015) User reviews124 Review Top review 5/10 Good production values, historically inaccurate I have been watching this series since the beginning, and find it quite well done as to costumes, scenery, production values in general. I nearly fell out of my seat, however, when Wilkin picks up a bible in the home of the executioner and says to the son something like "Exodus is my favorite book." Bibles appear in later episodes as well in the hands of lay people, and a cherished personal bible is central to one of the later episodes. Basic history of England, folks, there were no English language bibles prior to 1380, and the fact that lay people could not read bibles, which were in Latin Vulgate, became the impetus for revolution many, many years later. By setting this in the time of Edward II, who died in the early 14th century, this plot point, minor as it may be, is a jarring anachronism. helpful•25 13 LucyLou2013 Oct 7, 2015 Details Edit Release date September 15, 2015 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Official site Languages English Latin Also known as Poslaniec gniewu Production companies FX Productions Fox 21 Imagine Television See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 42 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news FX TV Show Ratings (updated 11/10/2021) Nov 11TVSeriesFinale.com ‘This Beast’: ‘Sons of Anarchy’ Creator Heads to Netflix for His Feature Directorial Debut Mar 9Slash Film Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was The Bastard Executioner (2015) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
