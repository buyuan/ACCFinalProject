Connections Edited into Er ist wieder da (2015) User reviews29 Review Top review 2/10 Neither fish nor meat - just Levy This movie wants to be a funny satire, but it's just a piece of embarrassing garbage. Camera, music and set design are very good, yet each of the actors seems to have another definition of comedy and the director was unable to communicate them HIS sense of it. Topsy-Turvy in the ensemble, although some good German actors do their best (esp. Ulrich Mühe). The absolute disaster is the screenplay. Neither comedy nor drama, it keeps searching for an identity. That's why the whole movie fails - Neither fish nor meat - just another silly joke-ridden but unfunny, pseudo-operatic flop by Dany Levy as so many before. Chaplin (The Great Dictator) and Mel Brooks (The Producers - Frühling für Hitler) have achieved with ease, what this movie tries hard but doesn't convey at all. Dany Levy still has to learn a very important film school lesson - screen writing (and in part directing) is just not his cup of tea. He's much better in fund raising money for (his) movies than making them. As most Levy movies, they are a waste of the German taxpayers money, funded by costly German TV-stations and funds of various state-departments. helpful•30 17 RudiRe Mar 13, 2008 Details Edit Release date January 11, 2007 (Germany) Country of origin Germany Official sites Official site (Germany) Official site (France) Languages German Hebrew Yiddish Also known as My Führer Filming locations Berlin, Germany Production companies ARTE Bayerischer Rundfunk (BR) Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR) See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget €1,000,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $2,465 Opening weekend US & Canada $1,197 Aug 16, 2009 Gross worldwide $7,785,273 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 29 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Indo-German script development workshop at 13th Mumbai Film Festival Oct 11BollywoodHungama Indo-German script development workshop at 13th Mumbai Film Festival Oct 11BollywoodHungama Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the English language plot outline for Mein Führer - Die wirklich wahrste Wahrheit über Adolf Hitler (2007)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
