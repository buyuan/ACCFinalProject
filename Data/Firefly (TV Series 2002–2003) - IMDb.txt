Genres Adventure Drama Sci-Fi Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Between shots, the cast preferred to wait in the ship's lounge instead of their trailers/dressing rooms. Goofs The Chinese characters for "Blue Sun" change from throughout the series. On Jayne's T-shirt, "Blue Sun" is Qing Ri, but in logo signs, it's Lan Ri. In ancient China, as well as Japan, green and blue were seen as different shades of the same color. The character Qing was used to represent both green and blue. In modern China, Lan is the character used for blue. Quotes opening song: Take my love, take my land / Take me where I cannot stand / I don't care, I'm still free / You can't take the sky from me / Take me out to the black / Tell 'em I ain't comin' back / Burn the land and boil the sea / You can't take the sky from me / There's no place I can be / Since I found serenity / But you can't take the sky from me Alternate versions The DVD episodes end with Joss Whedon and Tim Minear's Executive Producer credit washing across the screen, left to right. On the television episodes, instead of their names, a wireframe model of Serenity fades up. Connections Featured in The Rotten Tomatoes Show: Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time/Sex and the City 2/MacGruber (2010) Soundtracks The Ballad of Serenity Performed by Sonny Rhodes Written by Joss Whedon User reviews819 Review Top review Excellent Series This series is an excellent series. However, like other high quality shows, this one was cancelled prematurely. Science fiction often takes time for people to warm upto it, but in the end, the fanbase makes up for the time lost. (Stargate SG-1 was tossed around from HBO to Fox and now to SciFi where it is now the hottest scifi show on television) The magnitude of Star Trek: The Original Series was not realized until it was prematurely cancelled. Look at the money Paramount is making off of the franchise. This show is like many others who deserve recognition in science fiction. I recommend anyone who appreciates science fiction to watch this series, however, I must warn you that the ending is exceptionally disappointing. It is unfinished... an abrupt ending with so many lose ends, it may leave you with a feeling of grave disappointment when you realize there's no more episodes to watch... when everything that has been building up in suspense comes to nothing. Networks sure know how to get people to stop watching TV... cancel anything of any value. helpful•504 48 securis Feb 11, 2004 FAQ14 what gun does Captain Reynolds use as his main firearm?
