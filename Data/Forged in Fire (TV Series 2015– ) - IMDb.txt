In five days, the final pair must create in their own forge a Moro Kris sword, a blade with roots dating back to 300BC, in the season finale of this suspenseful and fiery History Channel series. knifenon fiction Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Game-Show Reality-TV Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Canister Damascus challenges are popular for the difficulty of the technique. When the clock is ticking and cameras are rolling contestants often do not or forget to let the white out dry all the way. (Honestly cannot blame them given the unique circumstances!) This often results in a poor quality surface layer on the new billet and difficulty removing the can. The time it takes to let the white out dry is much less than that of resurfacing a billet and or fighting a canister that is partially welded to your billet. Quotes Self - Judge: It will keal. Connections Featured in Too Much TV: Episode #1.16 (2016) User reviews61 Review Top review Extremely interesting! --- BUT.... I'm disappointed that this authentic, high quality series has lent its name to another unrelated show for the idiot portion of the world: "Forged in Fire - Knife or Death". I watched one episode, and it is a sleazy leech off this one. Out of shape contestants slash like animals at objects - pointless! Anyone could sharpen a lawn mower blade and participate. That garbage show doesn't have its own listing here at IMDb, so I'm posting here hoping to save anyone tempted to peek, tricked because of the name. helpful•15 6 rsvp321 May 10, 2018 Details Edit Release date June 22, 2015 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Official site Official YouTube channel Language English Also known as Forjado a fuego Production company Outpost Entertainment See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 42 minutes Color Color Related news A&e Networks Add Seven Channels to Frndly TV In New Distribution Deal Nov 10TVfanatic New on Netflix: November 2021 Releases Nov 1Den of Geek Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the French language plot outline for Forged in Fire (2015)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
