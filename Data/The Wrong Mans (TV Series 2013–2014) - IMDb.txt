After being sole witness to a car crash on a desolate country road, Sam answers an abandoned mobile telephone and hears a message that was clearly not meant for him: "If you are not here by 5 o'clock, we will kill your wife". Encouraged by office mail-room delivery boy Phil that they can be the heroes of the hour, the duo soon find themselves plunged into a deadly kidnap situation. The Wrong Mans involves a world of unexpected international conspiracy and intrigue, with the mysterious Scarlett and Stevens and the enigmatic secret agent Walker at the heart of the unfurling chaos. Sam and Phil must dodge bullets and escape explosions in their quest to save not just themselves, but their loved ones and ultimately their whole town. —BBC ad Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Comedy Crime Thriller Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia In both France and Germany, the first season was broadcast over a single evening. Connections Featured in 50 Years of BBC2 Comedy (2014) User reviews26 Review Top review 8/10 Action packed and funny script. Watched the first 3 episodes and left me wanting more. Is a series about 2 guys put in an outrageous situation after finding a phone. Full of funny moments and good action scenes. The comedy arrives from the situation they are put in and how naively and dumbfounded they manage these. The pace is extremely well done, no filler, just great script that rivals the best of action movies and also the funniest of comedy movies. The production is great, specially for a British show. Acting is fair, but characters are charismatic enough to get you caring. Worth watching. Is a top quality beginning of a show. I give 8/10. helpful•24 10 ropumar Oct 13, 2013 FAQ1 Why is this series titled The Wrong Mans , why Mans not Man or Men?
