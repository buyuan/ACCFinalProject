Genres Crime Drama Certificate R Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Robert De Niro spent four months learning to speak the Sicilian dialect of Italian in order to play Vito Corleone. Nearly all of the dialogue that his character speaks in the film was in Sicilian. Goofs During Roth's birthday party, the pattern on his shirt changes. Due to weather difficulties, the two minute scene took over a week to shoot and the original shirt was lost at some point. The production designer attempted to recreate it by drawing an approximation of the pattern onto a plain shirt, but it didn't quite match. Quotes Michael Corleone: My father taught me many things here - he taught me in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. Crazy credits As with the first film, no opening credits are shown. Although it is now commonplace for films not to have opening credits, it was considered innovative in 1974. Alternate versions In the German theatrical version, all Italian dialogs from the young Vito Corleone's scenes were dubbed into German, as well as the English and Spanish dialogs from Michael Corleone's scenes. The original Italian language for this footage has been only restored for the movie's DVD release in 2002. Connections Edited into The Godfather: A Novel for Television (1977) Soundtracks Senza Mamma (F. Pennino Edition) Francesco Pennino Performed by Livio Giorgi User reviews1.2K Review Top review 10/10 One of the greatest films ever made. To say that this film is a sequel is a sin. Al Pacino and Robert de Niro win the Oscar for this film, Robert de Niro's performance as Vito Corleone is perfect, every scene in which this one is perfect. Al Pacino as always perfect and unlike the first film, he is much better. PROS: EVERYTHING. The script, the direction, the cast, the performance, everything in this film is perfect and its 3 hours are worth it. CONS: NOTHING. This movie is perfect. helpful•35 3 AgustinCesaratti Oct 6, 2019 FAQ20 What is 'The Godfather: Part II' about? Is this movie based on a book?
