So he joined the S.E.A.L.s in order to become a sniper. After marrying Taya (Sienna Miller), Kyle and the other members of the team are called for their first tour of Iraq. Kyle's struggle isn't with his missions, but about his relationship with the reality of the war and, once returned at home, how he manages to handle it with his urban life, his wife, and kids. —Evandro Martirano assassiniraqsnipermercenaryneoconservatism432 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines One Bullet can tell the story Genres Action Biography Drama War Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for strong and disturbing war violence, and language throughout including some sexual references Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia To gain 40+ pounds, Bradley Cooper ate around 6,000 calories a day, which calculates to eating a meal every 55 minutes. Using his own trainer, he worked out four hours a day for several months. Cooper also took twice-daily lessons with a vocal coach, and spent many hours studying footage of Chris Kyle. When it came to pointing a rifle, Cooper trained with Navy S.E.A.L. sniper Kevin Lacz, who served with Kyle and was a consultant on this movie. Goofs When Kyle was watching the woman and child through his rifle scope, the camera shows him through the other end of the scope and his eye is magnified. In reality the opposite would happen, making his eye appear smaller. Quotes Chris Kyle: I'm not redneck; I'm Texan! Taya Renae Kyle: What's the difference? Chris Kyle: We ride horses, they ride their cousins. Crazy credits Footage of the real Chris Kyle's memorial service is featured during the first half of the end credits, while the instrumental "The Funeral" by Ennio Morricone plays on the soundtrack. Following the music and the footage, the rest of the end credits play in complete silence.

Raphael Saadiq (2015) Soundtracks Taya's Theme Written by Clint Eastwood Performed by Gennady Loktionov User reviews1K Review Top review clint hits the target with American sniper... it was extremely 'even'. nothing seemed overplayed. well balanced storytelling. as someone else wrote, best war movie i've seen in years...and while we're at it, best clint movie in a few outings, as well... i agree that the ending is a bit sudden. but there was no reason to drag it out, either... i don't feel it lingered on any one dynamic of what would be expected from a film like this...not TOO much violence or proselytizing/flag waving or lingering on casualty horrors... it doesn't, on the other hand, turn away from any of the ugliness, either... i thought bradley cooper did a great job in the role. the changes he gradually instilled into the character were subtle but present. it's as well done a war movie as i'll ever need. helpful•438 391 imizrahi2002 Jan 11, 2015 FAQ7 What is 'American Sniper' about?
