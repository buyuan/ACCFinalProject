Carl Reiner and Howard Morris joined the show later. Two of the great skits on the show were "The Hickenloopers", a battling husband-and-wife team and the clock in the Bavarian town of Baverhoff which always broke when the hour was struck. —J.E.

User reviews3 Review Top review One of the great comic melting pots I was a little kid when this show was on, but I remember it fondly. It was hilarious -- a great melting pot of comic genius. Caesar and Coca were wonderful as were all the supporting players including Reiner. The show was marvelously innovative in the early days of TV comedy and outdoes any of the later imitations such as SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE. Movie and TV satires, zany skits, and all sorts of funny mayhem reigned in Caesar's court with Coca as queen. Some of the best pieces are available in the movie 10 FROM YOUR SHOW OF SHOWS. If you get a chance to see that, do so. It is great humor from the innocent beginnings of live TV helpful•15 2 mermatt Sep 30, 1999 Details Edit Release date February 25, 1950 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Sid Caesar's Show of Shows Filming locations International Theatre - 5 Columbus Circle, Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA Production company Max Liebman Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 30 minutes Color Black and White Sound mix Mono Aspect ratio 1.33 : 1 Related news Mel Brooks to Be Honored With L.A.
