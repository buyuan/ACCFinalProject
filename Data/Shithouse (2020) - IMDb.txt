Connections References Rejected (2000) Soundtracks Shithouse Intro Written by 0fret Produced by 0fret User reviews42 Review Top review 6/10 Well made movie, but accuracy is often tedious As a college student, I can attest to the tonal and plot accuracy this movie achieves. It does that really well, but is the average day to day life of a college student trying to adjust to being away from home, while constantly shooting himself in the foot make for an entertaining movie? No. Is it worth a full length film? Also, no. This would have been a great 45 minute short. But the tedious and awkward, albeit accurate and realistic, dialogue which takes up the vast majority of this movie, runs dry far before the movie ends. I'm sure some people can relate to the movie enough to find this quite enjoyable, but I'm not one of them. Regardless, I think the is a successful debut for Raiff, as far as debuts go. helpful•7 9 dscoon Dec 16, 2020 Details Edit Release date October 16, 2020 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site movie website Language English Also known as Freshman Year Filming locations Los Angeles, California, USA Production company CMR Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross US & Canada $18,370 Opening weekend US & Canada $5,545 Oct 18, 2020 Gross worldwide $18,370 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 40 minutes Color Color Related news Cooper Raiff Set To Direct ‘The Trashers’ For 30West Aug 25Deadline Film + TV ‘Fear Street’s Olivia Scott Welch To Star Opposite George Baron In His Surreal Noir Pic ‘The Blue Rose’ Aug 19Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Shithouse (2020) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
