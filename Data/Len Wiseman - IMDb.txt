Personal Quote: I'd been jumping on movies as the prop guy or drawing storyboards before I joined the art department on Stargate, Independence Day and Godzilla. When I was pitching the script for Underworld, I did 12 detailed production drawings, which the producers later told me made them feel more comfortable about going with a first- time director.
