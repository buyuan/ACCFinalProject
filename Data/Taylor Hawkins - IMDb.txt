Personal Quote: [on Phil Collins] People seem to have forgotten that Phil is one of the greatest rock drummers ever to have walked the planet. I've been lucky enough to have had drum lessons from people like Chad (Smith) and Dave (Grohl) in the past, but I'd love to get a lesson from him. So Phil, if you're out there, please come and teach me how to play 'properly'.
