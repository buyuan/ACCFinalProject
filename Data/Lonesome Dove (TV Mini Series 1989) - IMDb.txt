He refused to use a stunt double for any of the riding scenes. Goofs Capt. Call's horse is named Hell Bitch and referred to with female pronouns through the entire series in spite of the fact that the horse is quite clearly a gelding (castrated male). Quotes Woodrow Call: [after beating a man nearly to death for hitting Newt he climbs on his horse and looks at the horrified towns people] I hate rude behavior in a man. I won't tolerate it. Crazy credits The opening credits are displayed over a series of black-and-white photographs taken from scenes in the movie. The very last on then turns to color and becomes the first scene of each episode. The end credits are displayed over a picture of a dove silhouette on a piece of wood. Alternate versions The 2008 DVD/Blu-Ray release was cropped to a 16:9 aspect ratio, and enhanced for viewing on widescreen televisions. These versions were also remastered, and the picture quality is superior to the original DVD release. Connections Featured in The 41st Annual Primetime Emmy Awards (1989) User reviews215 Review Top review 10/10 This is the finest Western film ever made, bar none. The Lonesome Dove mini-series contains every core element of a classic story of the mythic Old West: romance, tragedy, courageous and independent yet very human heroes, vicious yet believable villains, plenty of action, and the overall grit and determination of frontier life. These elements are all woven into an enthralling story centered on an epic journey across the American frontier--a cattle drive from Texas to Montana undertaken shortly after the Custer massacre. The movie is extremely faithful (in plot, dialogue, and characterizations) to the excellent novel by Larry McMurtry, and especially benefits from McMurtry's genius at narrative and story construction. What makes the film even better are the truly exceptional performances by the first rate cast, that includes Robert Duvall, Tommy Lee Jones, Robert Ulrich, and Anjelica Huston, and the great musical score, which won a well-deserved Emmy. This is the kind of film about the Old West that only comes along once in a blue moon, and lovers of Old West stories and movies (as well as real-life cowboys) watch it over and over. In my view, it ranks above even the classics of Western film, including Red River, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, and Shane--and I love all of those films. Even though it is over six hours long, and technically a TV mini-series, it should be considered a great film. helpful•138 7 swaine Dec 31, 1999 Details Edit Release date February 5, 1989 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Usamljena golubica Filming locations Alamo Village - Highway 674, Brackettville, Texas, USA Production companies Motown Productions Pangaea Qintex Entertainment See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 6 hours 24 minutes Color Color Sound mix Mono Aspect ratio 1.37 : 1(original ratio, negative ratio) Related news Gavan O’Herlihy Dies: Actor Who Played ‘Happy Days’ Disappeared Brother Was 70 Nov 12Deadline Film + TV ‘The Harder They Fall’: A Black-Led Western Revenge Film Nov 12Hollywood Insider - Substance & Meaningful Entertainment Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
