Personal Quote: I haven't read a review in, easily, 20, 25 years. I used to. I remember when Coming to America (1988) came out, Siskel and Ebert gave it two thumbs way down, saying it sucked. Then 10, 15 years later, I remember seeing them do a retrospective and they were both, "The classic 'Coming to America' blah blah blah.' The shelf life of movies changes over the years.
