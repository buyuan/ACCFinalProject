User reviews7 Review Top review 8/10 Good, not bad. Great informations but insufficient. They could be used more actual images or videos. And it was too short. However, generally, I liked it. There were real characters who lived. helpful•6 10 erensaygin-32191 Nov 2, 2021 Details Edit Release date September 24, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Mission 1142 Filming locations Buchenwald concentration camp, Weimar, Germany Production company Netflix See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 36 minutes Color Color Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Camp Confidential: America's Secret Nazis (2021) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
