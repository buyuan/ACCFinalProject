Connections Edited into Planet Earth II: A World of Wonder (2017) User reviews138 Review Top review 10/10 One of the best documentaries I 've ever seen One of the best documentaries I 've ever seen. Every episode is a new wonderful experience,getting to know the world that surrounds us. David Attenborough is the best narrator out there and this is his latest masterpiece. The crew has worked hard and managed to capture a large aspect of wild life whether it lives on a remote island in the arctic ocean or deep in one of the large human cities in India or United States of America. It shows that they put a lot of effort and time filming this under harsh conditions,but the close up captures of wild animals in their natural environment was worth the effort. Watched it already twice and will watch it again! This is something to watch again and again with your children, until the next Planet Earth arrives. Well done! helpful•20 5 panagiotiskatsanos Jan 1, 2017 Details Edit Release date November 6, 2016 (United Kingdom) Countries of origin United Kingdom Germany France China United States Official sites Official site Official site Languages English French Also known as Planet Earth 2 Production companies BBC Natural History Unit (NHU) BBC America Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen (ZDF) See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 4 hours 58 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Related news Oasis Doc Heads To Paramount+; Danish Oscar Shortlist; ITV & Tencent Ink Co-Pro Deal – Global Briefs Sep 16Deadline Film + TV ‘Money Heist’s’ Najwa Nimri Stars in First Look Image for ‘Insiders,’ Netflix’s First Original Spanish Reality Show – Global Bulletin Sep 16Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Spanish language plot outline for Planet Earth II (2016)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
