Genres Animation Action Adventure Fantasy Sci-Fi Thriller Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia After his fight with Vegeta, Goku is hospitalized in Wukong Hospital. Wukong is the Chinese name for Goku. Goofs In the Majin Buu saga, Shen is well aware that two henchmen joined the martial arts tournament to drain the energy from someone extremely powerful, who ends up being Gohan. Shen allows this to be able to follow the henchmen and find their spaceship, where Majin Buu will be resurrected. However, if he would have impeded Gohan's energy drain in the first place, or in fact just even told the Z Fighters of everything before the henchmen attacked, the whole Majin Buu saga would be non-existent, as Majin Buu would not be able to be resurrected. Quotes Vegeta: Amazing. How do you do it Kakarot? You've always been like this, ever since the day I first met you, always ready to meet the next challenge, even if it's bigger than you are. "So, we meet at last. We have been expecting you, Kakarot. We were beginning to think you wouldn't show. Hopefully, now things will get more interesting around here." "How can this be happening? I am a super-elite... the prince of all Saiyans. and he is just a low-level, a common soldier. I am one of the greatest fighters in the universe!" It was the same on Namek. You have improved so much that it would make Recoome like you were standing still. Your power had increase so dramatically since our battle on Earth that I thought you have done it. I thought... that you have become a Super-Saiyan. It tore me apart. How could a low-class soldier accomplish so easily what I... I had struggle my whole life to achive? After 3 millennia, it is finally happened; A new Super-Saiyin has emerged, and somehow, I have become this popish witness. Then at last it happened. I too transformed. After living every moment of every day for the single purpose of surpassing you, I finally became a Super-Saiyin myself. The prince have reclaim his throne and fulfilled his destiny. But no matter how strong I became, your power still exceeded mine. At first I thought it was your loved ones, than it was your instinct to protect them that spired you on, and pushed you beyond your limits. But then I found myself with a family of my own, and my power... didn't increase at all. I used to fight for the shear of pleasure, for the thrill of the hunt, all I had the strength unmetered, I spared no one. And yet you showed mercy to every one, even your fiercest enemies, even me... Yet you never thought to kill, more for revenge. Only to test your limits, and to push us beyond them, to become the strongest you could possibly be. How can a Saiyin fight like that, and at the same time be so gentle that he wouldn't hurt a fly? It makes me angry just thinking about it. But perhaps it is my anger that has made me blind to the truth for so long. I see it now. this day has made it all too clear. Your better than me, Kakarot. You are the Best... Crazy credits When Dragon Ball Z was first dubbed, the opening credits used a mix of footage from the series, from the first three movies, and the Japanese intro sequences. It was accompanied by an American-only theme song called Rock the Dragon. This intro was unusual in that it had footage from movies that never aired on TV at the time, and in that it showed many things that would not happen until much later in the series, and not as a part of this dubbed version (Future Trunks, short-haired Yamcha, Super Saiyan transformations, etc.) Alternate versions There are two versions of the english dub of Dragon Ball Z, one is the edited version which is shown on Cartoon Network, and a uncut version which adds several minutes of footage not seen in the edited version Connections Alternate-language version of Dragon Ball: Doragon bôru (1986) Soundtracks Rock The Dragon (theme song) (English version) Performed by Ron Wasserman and Jeremy Sweet Written and Composed by Shuki Levy and Haim Saban (Broadcast Seasons 1 - 3) User reviews185 Review Top review 10/10 An Amazing Story... I'm a late blooming DBZ fan, but I've already seen almost the entire series! LOL! I will tell you the story of how I became a die-hard fan, and why you'll be VERY sorry if you haven't already! It was around the year 1999 that I first came across DBZ. I think the Namek saga was airing on Cartoon Network. My friend was big on the show (though he had very little knowledge of it's origins) and forced me to watch it myself. I made fun of the show every-time he watched it. I thought it was corny, cheesy and the voice-acting was stupid. HOWEVER, somewhere along the way in the summer of 2001 he told me they were re-airing the Android saga on CN. Well, I started the old usual comments, making fun of it. But then.. I actually became interested in the story. After a few episodes, I was hooked. You see, the story of Dragonball is more than you think. It covers over 500 episodes in it's entire run over three different animated series. I began watching with the Android/Cell sagas. I watched them to the end and then watched the Frieza saga. Then I watched the Saiyan and Namek Saga. Now here we are today at the Buu saga. What better time to become a DBZ fan than now! The last 54 episodes of the show will air this fall, and that's something NOT to be missed. The show never has an ending to a story. It's a continous "to be continued" storyline that grows and grows. Characters have time to develop into interesting relationships among them, making moments where someone dies or is hurt even more emotional. It tells the story of Goku (son Goku in Japan) who is an incredible man born with an amazing fighting talent. His strength never ceases and he becomes stronger and stronger. He is kind and pure of heart.. a friend to even his enemies at times. He is the central point of DBZ, but not the only point. Throughout the series, he learns of his Saiyan heritage, finding that he was born of an alien human-like race that has an ability to concentrate energy called Kai (or ki) to create energy blasts, fly, etc. They are born with a natural instinct to fight, and conquer entire planets to sale to the highest bidder. That is only the beginning of DBZ, there are 200 episodes or so of a previous series called Dragonball that explain Goku's childhood-into-adult hood. DBZ covers him from his early twenties or so all the way until he's over 50 years old. The show has sparked 13 movies and two specials.. and much more. Some of the movies are dubbed in english, while others are only available in Japanese subtitled versions. ANYWAY, this show is specatacular, and takes forever to explain every aspect of the storyline. The ORIGINAL Japanese version has much better music and voice acting, I'll admit. And the English versions (at least early episodes) were edited to death, the show still holds what makes it magic. The beginning of the series will re-air on Cartoon Network as of May 2002. I suggest you begin watching. Do NOT let the animation, or the voice-acting, or bad editing of this first saga shake you away. The show takes time to understand and become interested in, but once your there, you'll be hooked. There are over 290 episodes of DBZ, and the animation gets much better, as does the storyline. Just keep watching, trust me... your gonna love it! helpful•84 20 lucas-42 Apr 30, 2002 FAQ37 Why is there two entries for Dragon Ball Z series? Why didn't Trunks or Goten ever grow a Saiyan tail? How did Yamcha get the scars on his face? They weren't there in the original Dragon Ball.
