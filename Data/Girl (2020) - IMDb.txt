User reviews71 Review Top review I surprisingly enjoyed it much more than I expected. I really only decided to give this a go because I'm a fan of both Mickey Rourke and Bella Thorne, and I'm glad I did. The casting and performances by everyone were actually spot on and convincing, with Rourke, Faust and Thorne stealing the show. Seasoned actor turned newb writer and director Chad Faust - who also had a starring role, did not disappoint wearing the many hats. His directing was hard to critique and was comparable to seasoned filmmakers. His writing was just as good - gritty, suspenseful, slickly written with some nice twists. It did have some minor plot and technical issues, but considering this was put together by a newb filmmaker, there's much room to be forgiving, especially when I've seen some bad productions lately by seasoned filmmakers. The 92 min runtime was perfect and flew by with the excellent pacing and non-stop suspense. I kinda wanted another 10-15 mins of additional story added, maybe more family backstory and/or Thornes character's upbringing by her mother. The score was on point and very fitting throughout the entire film. The cinematography and location/sets were excellent. Mad props and respect to the newb filmmaker Chad Faust for successfully putting this little gem together. It's a well deserved 8/10 from me.
