LAPD Patrol Officer Trey Sellars joined the force as a day job until his acting career took off. During an undercover drug buy Mitch was working that Trey botched by calling in for backup and drawing media attention, Mitch's partner is shot with a very exotic 12-gauge automatic weapon; Mitch then shoots the video camera out of the hands of a reporter filming the action when the cameraman refused to shut it down. Faced with a $10 million lawsuit, the department agrees to let producer Chase Renzi film Mitch's investigation for a new reality TV show, and constantly tries to make everything more "viewer friendly" by changing everything about Mitch's life to fit the stereotypical view of police officers--and partners him with Trey. —Jeff Cross <blackjac_1998@yahoo.com> policebuddy coppolice shootoutfoot chasefighting133 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Lights. Camera. Aggravation. Genres Action Comedy Crime Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for action violence, language and some drug content Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Rene Russo's assistant "Annie" is portrayed by Robert De Niro's real-life adopted daughter Drena De Niro. Goofs When Trey is giving Mitch advice about not 'wearing ugly checkered shirts' , and needs to wear solids more, he is actually already wearing the solid blue shirt that Rene's character compliments him on later. Quotes William Shatner: [advising Trey on how TV cops taste drugs] You spear the knife into the bag... then pick some of the drugs up with the knife... then lightly press it on your tongue. And that is how TV cops taste drugs! Mitch Preston: What if it's cyanide? There's a reason real cops don't taste drugs.

He started off the year by teaming with Robert De Niro (who was reinventing himself as a comic actor) in this Buddy Cop Picture. Plot In A Paragraph: Two very different cops are forced to team up on a new reality based television cop show, while tracking down the manufacturer and distributor of an illegally made semi-automatic firearm. It starts off well (especially the first 30 minuted or so) and I was enjoying myself. Sadly, it ends up becoming the type of movies it is making fun of. So it's early promise is not fully lived up to, but I still liked it. There is decent chemistry between the two leads. Every good scene in this movie features De Niro and Murphy. Usually without specially effects or action. William Shatner shows up to give Murphy and De Niro acting tips which is a lot of fun. All in all, it's an enjoyable action comedy for me. Showtime ended 2002 as the 70th highest grossing movie of the year, with a domestic haul of $38 million dollars. Against an $85 million budget. helpful•3 0 slightlymad22 Jan 30, 2018 Details Edit Release date March 15, 2002 (United States) Countries of origin United States Australia Language English Also known as Шоу починається Filming locations Westin Bonaventure Hotel & Suites - 404 S.
