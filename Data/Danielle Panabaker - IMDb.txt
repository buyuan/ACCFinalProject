Personal Quote: [on having a sister who is also an actress] It's wonderful. If anything, this business has brought my family together because we can sit at the dinner table and say, "Oh, my gosh, wait 'til you hear this crazy story". And my whole family always comes to sets with me, so it's something we can share, as opposed to tearing us apart.
