There is only one way to ensure mankind's survival: Interstellar travel. A newly discovered wormhole in the far reaches of our solar system allows a team of astronauts to go where no man has gone before, a planet that may have the right environment to sustain human life. —ahmetkozan astronautsaving the worldgravityrelativitywormhole244 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Mankind was born on Earth. It was never meant to die here. Genres Adventure Drama Sci-Fi Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for some intense perilous action and brief strong language. Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Early in pre-production, Dr. Kip Thorne laid down two guidelines to strictly follow: nothing would violate established physical laws, and that all the wild speculations would spring from science, and not from the creative mind of a screenwriter. Writer, Producer, and Director Christopher Nolan accepted these terms, as long as they did not get in the way of the making of the movie. That did not prevent clashes, though; at one point Thorne spent two weeks talking Nolan out of an idea about travelling faster than light. Goofs Two characters sustain a fall from an ice plateau, on a steep ice ramp, onto a shadowy ice platform. A moment later, a panoramic shot shows them fighting on a very different place. Quotes Cooper: We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars. Now we just look down, and worry about our place in the dirt. Crazy credits The Warner Bros, Paramount, Syncopy and Legendary Pictures logos are brown and dusty, representing Earth's arid dry state in the film. Alternate versions The 70mm IMAX version is two minutes shorter than the regular 70mm, Digital IMAX, 35mm, and digital projection versions. This is because the end credits are played in an abbreviated slide-show form (rather than scrolling from bottom to top), due to the size capacity of the IMAX platters, which can hold a maximum of 167 minutes of film.

I can't describe anything. It's a film that leads you to think about yourself and your plans in your life. I am a real series/movies' lover and... This was awesome. helpful•340 67 fontenlabrador Apr 17, 2019 FAQ21 Why did Earth change its history books to claim that the Apollo missions to the Moon were faked?
