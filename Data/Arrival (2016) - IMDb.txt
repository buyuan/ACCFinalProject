Genres Drama Sci-Fi Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for brief strong language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Director Denis Villeneuve and screenwriter Eric Heisserer created a fully functioning, visual, alien language. Heisserer, Villeneuve and their teams managed to create a "logogram bible," which included over a hundred different completely operative logo-grams, seventy-one of which are actually featured in the movie. Goofs In the main landings chart the Australian contact point seems to be in the Indian Ocean off Geralton in Western Australia. In a later scene there is a brief shot of an alien spacecraft with central Sydney in the distance across water. Sydney is on Australia's east coast. Quotes Louise Banks: Despite knowing the journey... and where it leads... I embrace it... and I welcome every moment of it. Crazy credits Denis Villeneuve's daughter, Salomé Villeneuve, is listed as "Hazmat Suit Specialist".

Prisoners, Sicario and now Arrival (haven't seen Enemy yet, or some of his earlier work). Denis knows how to capture the tension. It is almost the strongest point of all of his films. Minimal use of computer generated images, and main focus on story, characters, acting and thrilling scenes. Back on IMDb board, I have noticed a lot of people calling Arrival a boring movie. So many hypocrites these days. People trying to point out every possible flaw to look and sound smarter while at the same time hailing far worse movies. Calling it boring and slow while at the same time complaining no originality in Hollywood, only giant CGI laser explosions extravaganza. Go watch Independence Day. In Arrival there is no action, no explosions, just some amazing acting performances combined with good directing, editing and cinematography. There was not a single moment I felt bored. helpful•663 177 SilentEyes_ Feb 13, 2017 Details Edit Release date January 20, 2017 (China) Countries of origin United States Canada Official sites Official Facebook (France) Official Facebook Page Languages English Russian Mandarin Also known as Story of Your Life Filming locations Montréal, Québec, Canada Production companies Lava Bear Films FilmNation Entertainment 21 Laps Entertainment See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $47,000,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $100,546,139 Opening weekend US & Canada $24,074,047 Nov 13, 2016 Gross worldwide $203,388,186 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 56 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 2.39 : 1 Related news Watch: 'The Beauty of Denis Villeneuve' Cinematography Highlights Nov 15firstshowing.net Oscars 2022: Best Director predictions and the state of the race Nov 15Gold Derby Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
