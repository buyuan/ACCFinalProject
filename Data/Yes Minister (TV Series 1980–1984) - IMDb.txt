He tries to do something and cut government waste, but he is continually held back by the smart and wily Permanent Secretary of the Department, Sir Humphrey Appleby. Private secretary Bernard Woolley is caught in the middle, between his political master, and his civil service boss. —Tony Lammens <lammens@connexus.apana.org.au> ministerbritish governmentbritish politicsbureaucratbureaucracy29 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genre Comedy Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The writers had advisors who worked within the government and many of the stories were based on real situations. For example, in season three, episode four, "The Moral Dimension", they go to an Arab country where alcohol is not allowed, and so they set up a "communications room" in the embassy where they keep a stash of booze so they could slip out and have a drink. This really happened. Goofs During the train sequence in "The Official Visit", a close-up shows that the warning notice on the wall is written in gibberish. Quotes Bernard Woolley: It makes me feel rather downcast. If it's our job to implement Government Policies, shouldn't we believe in them? Sir Humphrey Appleby: What an extraordinary thing to say. Bernard Woolley: Why? Sir Humphrey Appleby: Bernard, I have served 11 Governments in the last 30 years, if I believed in all their policies, I would have been passionately commited to keeping out of the Common Market and passionately committed to going into it, I would've been utterly convinced of the rightness of Nationalising Steel, and of denationalising it, and renationalising it. On Capital Punishment I would have been a fervent retentionist and an ardent Abolitionist, I would have been a Keynesian and a Friedmanite, a Grammar School Destroyer and Preserver, a Nationalisation Freak and a Privatisation Maniac, but above all, I would have been a stark, staring, raving Schizophrenic! Alternate versions The pilot version of the first episode, "Open Government", was released on the UK DVD release of Series 1. It differs from the broadcast version in having different, cheaper-looking titles and different theme music (composed by Max Harris with Sidney Margo). Connections Featured in Zomergasten: Episode #8.4 (1995) User reviews46 Review Top review Witty Political Britcom "Yes, Minister" was an impeccably written, masterfully witty British political satire. The late Paul Eddington was very funny as James Hacker, a bumbling minister who is constantly at odds with his civil servant, Sir Humphrey Appleby, played masterfully by Oscar winner Nigel Hawthorne. This show provided perhaps the most insightful and interesting look behind the scenes of the British, or any political system. This show gives new meaning to the saying, "Red Tape." It's a shame it's not on in the US much anymore, but it's still available on video. helpful•33 0 Matt M. Jul 13, 1999 FAQ1 What party does Jim Hacker represent?
