Seventy-five years before this, the characters Archie, Betty, and Veronica were created by publisher John L. Goldwater and artist Bob Montana, and they were introduced in Pep Comics #22 in December 1941. Goofs When Betty receives the call from the unknown number (The Black Hood) her iPhone rings audibly. When it shows a closeup of her iPhone the mute switch is down, meaning the phone is on silent. Quotes [tries to open a box in Miss Grundy's car] Betty Cooper: Bobby pin. Veronica Lodge: Okay, Ms. MacGyver. [unlocks box] Betty Cooper: I learned that from the Nancy Drew detective handbook. Crazy credits The episodes from the first season have a 2016 copyright date in the credits.
