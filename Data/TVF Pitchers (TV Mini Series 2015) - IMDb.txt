Things are kicked off by Naveen who, angry at not being given his due at work, resigns in a drunk state. At the same time, he receives news of his B-Plan reaching the final round of the NASSCOM start-up conclave. This begins a series of situations in which the four friends rediscover what they really want in life and the challenges they face in getting their start-up idea off the ground.It's story is inspired from HBO TV series "Silicon Valley" but the plot is well designed in accordance with Indian audience who are not well aware of the Idea of Startup. —ahmetkozan tv mini seriestvfthe viral feverstart upentrepreneur Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Comedy Drama Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Arunabh Kumar, founder of The Viral Fever, went to MTV but got rejected as they thought that the "Television viewers cannot understand so high intellectual content". This is when the idea of featuring their content on YouTube came up. User reviews220 Review Top review 10/10 Brilliant show, excellent performances I will try to keep it short: 1. Excellent dialogues- Well written and dialogues that are relevant to the audience go a long way in making this an excellent show. 2. Acting- Everyone excels in their roles. TVF has come a long way and this is a sleek product with top-notch performance (hat tip to Jeetu for his scenes with his father). 3. TVF- The hype surrounding TVF and their TV shows (a highly recommended "Permanent Roommates" included) is completely justified. Just like the character "Naveen Bansal" says about being fearless as a kid, TVF is just that even now and we as audiences benefit from that. 4. Entertainment- It is very easy to get preachy while dealing with subjects such as entrepreneurship (and end up being documentary like in tone) but TVF is true to its promise of delivering quality entertainment that is laced with acidic yet witty commentary about the malaise and issues surrounding entrepreneurship. 5. Production Value- The show looks very polished and the hard work TVF has put into making the show look absolutely realistic shows. helpful•72 15 apoorvaankur Aug 3, 2015 Details Edit Release date June 3, 2015 (India) Country of origin India Official sites Official Facebook Official Site Languages Hindi English Also known as Далеко Идущие Production companies Contagious Online Media Network The Viral Fever See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 40 minutes Color Color Related news Maanvi Gagroo: Got typecast as 'bubbly' girl May 31GlamSham Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode Most anticipated Indian movies and shows Percentage shows amount of top page views. 1Marakkar: Lion of the Arabian Sea39.3% 2Ram Asur23.7% 3Bunty Aur Babli 28.2% 4RRR6.0% 5Antim: The Final Truth5.2% 6Pushpa: The Rise - Part 14.2% 7Matsya Kaand3.9% 8Satyameva Jayate 23.8% 9Minnal Murali2.9% 10Dangerous2.8% Updates approximately every 20 minutes.
