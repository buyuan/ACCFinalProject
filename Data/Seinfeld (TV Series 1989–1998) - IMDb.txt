The premise of this sitcom is Jerry and his friends going through everyday life, discussing various quirky situations, to which we can all relate (especially if we live in New York City). The eccentric personalities of the offbeat characters who make up Jerry's social circle contribute to the fun. —Tad Dibbern <DIBBERN_D@a1.mscf.upenn.edu> cringe comedysituation comedybuddy comedynew york yankeesdating49 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genre Comedy Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Larry David famously instituted a policy of "no hugging, no learning", meaning that the show must avoid sentimentality and moral lessons, and the characters must never learn nor grow from their wrongdoings. Goofs Jerry and Kramer's apartment building address is said several times to be 129 West 81st Street, but the awning outside of the building has the address 757. Quotes Telemarketer: Hi, would you be interested in switching over to TMI long distance service? Jerry: Oh, gee, I can't talk right now. Why don't you give me your home number and I'll call you later? Telemarketer: Uh, well I'm sorry, we're not allowed to do that. Jerry: Oh, I guess you don't want people calling you at home. Telemarketer: No. Jerry: Well, now you know how I feel. [Jerry hangs up phone] Crazy credits The series does not have an opening credits sequence. Instead, the lead actor credits play out over a scene. Now commonplace in sitcoms and drama series, this was considered a novelty in 1990 and sparked a debate over the future of opening credits in TV series. Alternate versions George's father was initially played by 'John Randolph' in the episode "The Handicap Spot". In syndication his guest appearance has been replaced by new footage featuring Jerry Stiller who played George's father in the later episodes. The DVD release of this episode featured in the Season 4 box set allows the option to watch either version. Connections Edited into Seinfeld: The Chronicle (1998) Soundtracks Seinfeld Theme Song Written by Jonathan Wolff User reviews555 Review Top review I Absolutely Love It. This show was totally unique. Nothing has been done like it before, or since (with the possible exception of the Simpsons, which does mimic some of the "nothing" plots a little). While it was about nothing, it was really about everything--but the little things that no one thinks about, like giving your bank code to your fiancé. I also liked how this show was the last of the "non-fashion" shows. You always saw Kramer wear the same ridiculous jacket, pants, and shirt. George always had those too-small plaid shirts and even Jerry had the black-and-gray striped shirt we saw him wear in the one where he and George make "The Pact". Even Elaine had many of the same clothes, even after her "make-over". I mean, I LOVE the show Friends but every time the guys have a new turtleneck or sweater, and the girls always have a new dress or a new pair of pants, which is totally unrealistic (for the guys anyway). This show had consistent humour all the way up to the last season, which is unusual for many shows. I LOVED George styling his hair to look like the bald guy from NYPD Blue, Elaine buying the JuJubes on the way to the hospital, Uncle Leo yelling "STOP THE SHOW" on the PBS special--these were just some of the great moments! This show is the best on televison, and if you haven't seen it, go and watch now! helpful•174 71 shrek2004 Jul 25, 2003 FAQ9 Who is Ruthie Cohen? What are the words to George's song on his answering machine? Is it true that there is a Superman reference in every episode?
