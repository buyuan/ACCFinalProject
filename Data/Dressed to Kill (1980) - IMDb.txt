Later that day, after complaining to her psychiatrist Dr. Robert Elliott about her husband's pathetic performance in bed, she meets a strange man at a museum and returns to his apartment where they continue an adulterous encounter that began in the taxicab. Before she leaves his apartment, she finds papers which certify that the man has a venereal disease. Panicked, Kate rushes into the elevator, but has to return to his apartment when she realizes she's forgotten her wedding ring. When the elevator doors open, she's brutally slashed to death by a tall blonde woman wearing dark sunglasses. Liz Blake, a high-class call girl, is the only witness to the murder and she becomes the prime suspect and the murderer's next target. Liz is rescued from being killed by Kate's son Peter, who enlists the help of Liz to catch his mother's killer as Detective Marino, who's in charge of the case, is uncooperative in the investigation. —alfiehitchie showerdysfunctional marriagethroat slittingblondewedding ring222 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines The latest fashion in murder. Genres Crime Drama Mystery Thriller Certificate R Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia As a young man, at his mother's urging, Brian De Palma followed his father and used recording equipment to try and catch him with another woman. That incident inspired this movie. Goofs At 55 minutes in the unrated version, Keith Gordon looks in the visor of his Super 8 camera. The format of the visor is 'Cinemascope', which has never been really possible with S8. Later, when we view the resulting movie, it is in the standard 4/3 format. Quotes Liz Blake: Do you want to fuck me? Doctor Robert Elliott: Oh, yes. Liz Blake: Then why don't you? Doctor Robert Elliott: Because I'm a doctor and... Liz Blake: Fucked a lot of doctors. Doctor Robert Elliott: ...and I'm married. Liz Blake: Fucked a lot of them, too. Alternate versions NBC edited 14 minutes from this film for its 1982 network television premiere. Connections Edited into Sex at 24 Frames Per Second (2003) Soundtracks The Shower (Main Title Theme) (uncredited) Composed by Pino Donaggio Conducted by Natale Massara User reviews246 Review Top review 8/10 Surreal, bloody, erotically charged odyssey When you compare what Brian De Palma was doing in the 80's to what passes for entertainment today, his films keep looking better and better. "Dressed To Kill, "Blow Out", "Body Double", "Scarface" and "Carlito's Way" are all superb works of a cinematic craftsman at the peak of his powers. The guy had a long run of better than average films. This is pure Hitchcock with an 80's dash of lurid perversion, an affectionately told tale of lust and murder with plenty of twists, huge helpings of style, a stunning Pino Donaggio score, and a trashy, giallo-inspired plot. De Palma's love of complex camera-work and luscious, blood-smudged visuals helps overcome the logical holes while the terrific performances of Dennis Franz, Keith Gordon (a good director in his own right), Nancy Allen (De Palma's wife at the time) and Michael Caine make every scene special. Let the virtuoso take you on a surreal, scary, erotically charged odyssey and you'll enjoy every frame of "Dressed To Kill". helpful•82 17 fertilecelluloid Feb 17, 2006 FAQ2 Who played the guy in the museum who lures Angie Dickenson into the taxi?
