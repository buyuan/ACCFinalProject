Connections Referenced in TV in Black: The First Fifty Years (2004) User reviews10 Review Top review Cosby Show Meets Full House An obvious WB version of The Cosby Show, except this show spent too much time preaching about cliché morals that have been told a thousand times on shows like Full House and The Cosby Show. Too many morals and not enough comedy. The parents are unlikeable (the mother is a snob and the father is too uptight) and the children are unlikeable too. Since the family members spent too much time getting into the typical trouble that leads to that big moral speech at the end, they didn't have enough time to be funny so they added flat boring neighbors to make the show bearable. TV shows like this didn't last because at the end of the day, we watch TV to be entertained, not to be preached to. And though family shows such as The Cosby Show and Full House preached, they were still charming at the same time. helpful•5 7 marymorphine Aug 5, 2005 Details Edit Release date January 18, 1995 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Warner Bros.
