In addition to the talk show set receiving an overhaul, several architectural features of the theater were restored. The theater's ornate domed ceiling, which had been hidden behind air ducts and sound buffers, was uncovered, and the ornate stained-glass windows, which had been removed and placed in storage during the Letterman era, were re-installed. Quotes Stephen Colbert: [at the Republican National Convention podium] Welcome, citizens, to the 2016 Hungry for Power Games! Ha ha, beautiful! This week, in this arena, the Republicans shall prove they are truly passionate about one candidate: Hillary Clinton. They will do anything to stop her, up to and including nominating Donald J. Jonah Jameson Trump. But Tribute Trump will not enter the arena alone, no. He has formed an alliance with Indiana governor Mike Pence. [falls asleep] Stephen Colbert: Sorry, I blacked out there for a moment. So it is my honor to hereby launch and begin the 2016 Republican National Hungry for Power Games! [bangs gavel; security begins to escort him away] Stephen Colbert: Look, I know I'm not supposed to be up here, but let's be honest: neither is Donald Trump. Connections Featured in HyperNormalisation (2016) User reviews73 Review Top review 9/10 Colbert has something special This is, what? Show number 7 so far? Way too soon to form an opinion, but what I can say is, Stephen Colbert has something unique that cannot be mimicked by other late night hosts, even if they wanted to. Watch the Cruz interview. You can't do what Colbert did there unless you have something special deeply ingrained in you. I have been happy with Colbert's stewardship of The Late Show. He retains the sharp wit and intelligence from his previous show without the fake character. If anything, he needs to discard the old character a little more, as I am sure he is aware. Baptiste is kind of annoying and so is Stephen's show intros where he announces who the guests will be against a cartoonish graphic. The interactions between Colbert and Baptiste seem stilted and awkward. The show is solid and gaining traction rapidly. I just hope the corporate network doesn't get scared by what seems to be a bit of political polarization. helpful•36 38 seattlematthew Sep 23, 2015 Details Edit Release date September 8, 2015 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Official Facebook Official Instagram Language English Also known as A Late Show with Stephen Colbert Filming locations Ed Sullivan Theater - 1697 Broadway, Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA Production companies Spartina Productions Busboy Productions CBS Television Studios See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 41 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news ‘The Afterparty’ at Apple TV Plus Gets January Premiere Date (TV News Roundup) Nov 17Variety Film + TV Did Dwyane Wade Have a Poster of Gabrielle Union in College?
