Phastos : You know what has never saved the world? Your sarcasm. [Sprite stabs Sersi] Sprite : You know why I hated living with humans? Because they reminded me of things I didn't even know I wanted. Because of them, now I want to know what it feels like to grow up. To fall in love. To have a family. And to know in the end I've lived. Sprite : So now that Captain Rogers and Iron Man are both gone, who do you think's gonna lead the Avengers? Ikaris : I could lead them.
