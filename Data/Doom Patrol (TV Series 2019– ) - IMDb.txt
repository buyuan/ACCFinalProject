The Doom Patrol's members each suffered horrible accidents that gave them superhuman abilities - but also left them scarred and disfigured. Traumatized and downtrodden, the team found purpose through The Chief, who brought them together to investigate the weirdest phenomena in existence - and to protect Earth from what they find. Part support group, part Super Hero team, the Doom Patrol is a band of super-powered freaks who fight for a world that wants nothing to do with them. Picking up after the events of Titans, Doom Patrol will find these reluctant heroes in a place they never expected to be, called to action by none other than Cyborg, who comes to them with a mission hard to refuse, but with a warning that is hard to ignore: their lives will never, ever be the same. —ahmetkozan based on comic booksplit personalitydc comicsoutcastsuperhero16 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Action Adventure Comedy Drama Mystery Sci-Fi Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Although "Doom Patrol" was technically considered to be a spin-off of "Titans", a lot of fans noticed inconsistencies between the series and the episode of "Titans" in which they were originally introduced. The timeline didn't seem to sync with that of "Titans" and the fact that Beast Boy was never shown or mentioned in any capacity, despite having initially been a long standing member of the team. When asked about these inconsistencies, producers always gave vague answers and said they didn't want to be tied down to the "Titans" mythology. The discrepancies were finally clarified during the CW's "Crisis On Infinite Earths" crossover event. At the conclusion of the event, it was shown that the "Doom Patrol" series takes place on Earth-21 while "Titans" takes place on Earth-9. Therefore the Doom Patrol team featured in the "Titans" episode is NOT the same team featured in the "Doom Patrol" series, but rather the Earth-9 version. Crazy credits The Warner Bros and DC logos are colored bronze, Robotman's color, and are set against a blue sky. The albino donkey is present; a truck passes by it and changes the WB logo into the DC logo.
