Young King Louis XIV decides to move the court from the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye near Paris to his father's former hunting lodge near the hamlet of Versailles as a means to force their submission. As Louis renovates and expands his new Palace of Versailles, the nobles-displaced from their usual surroundings but compelled to surround the king-become embroiled in increasingly dangerous intrigues. —Wiki king louis xivversailleskingdom of francepregnant nuditypolitical intrigue38 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Biography Drama History Romance War Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia As of 2015, this is the most expensive television show ever produced in France.

Connections Featured in Too Much TV: Episode #1.14 (2016) Soundtracks Outro Performed by M83 [Opening credits theme] User reviews121 Review Top review 10/10 A feast for the eyes I've been waiting for what seems like ages for a series to come along that I look forward to each episode. This is it. Absolutely gorgeous, stunning settings, costumes and sets. The actors are fascinating. I don't care if it is minute by minute historically accurate as I can read a history book about Versailles and life there, but this is super interesting as a drama within that palace and time frame. Everyone is just so real. They are horrible, loving, scheming, nasty, lavish, flamboyant, crafty and violent, but isn't that what real life and humans are all about? I am loving the costumes, jewels, food, florals, decor and art. Fingers crossed for Season 2. helpful•93 25 pale_pixie Jan 4, 2016 FAQ15 What is Versailles? Does Versailles coincide with the Three Musketeers? Was Prince Philippe really a homosexual?
