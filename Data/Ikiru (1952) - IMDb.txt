He has worked in the same department for 30 years. His life is pretty boring and monotonous, though he once used to have passion and drive. Then one day he discovers that he has stomach cancer and has less than a year to live. After the initial depression he sets about living for the first time in over 20 years. Then he realises that his limited time left is not just for living life to the full but to leave something meaningful behind... —grantss meaning of lifecancerdeathbureaucratplayground211 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines One of the Great Films of Our Time! Genre Drama Certificate Not Rated Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia When Takashi Shimura rehearsed his singing of "Song of the Gondola," director Akira Kurosawa instructed him to "sing the song as if you are a stranger in a world where nobody believes you exist." Goofs In the last scene with Toyo (in the restaurant with the birthday party going on), the position of the bell on the mechanical bunny changes, even though neither actor has touched the bunny. Quotes Kanji: I can't afford to hate people. I don't have that kind of time.

With images throughout that will stay with you for a long time, and a terrific supporting performance by Miki Odagiri as a vivacious young "office lady", "Ikiru" is still an absolute knockout more than 50 years on. helpful•49 18 Butch-Higgins Oct 16, 2003 FAQ1 What Are The English Lyrics To The Song Kanji Watanabe Sings?
