Connections Featured in Atop the Fourth Wall: 22 Brides #1 (2009) User reviews16 Review Top review GOAT show It's so good and the re-watchability factor is insane. It's not even only about nostalgia, this show is mint and even gets better the older you get as you understand things you couldn't understand as a kid. The way they introduced other DC characters without taking the main focus away from the OG Justice league members basically expands an amazing world that we didn't even know was there to begin with. Basically bigger and better. This is the only reason I'm a dc fan and to go a bit off topic, why the DCEU is just so disappointing. helpful•0 0 Funkeysnow Jun 24, 2021 Details Edit Release date July 31, 2004 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Liên Minh Công Lý: Không Giới Hạn Production companies DC Comics Warner Bros.
