Fun-loving, laid-back dad Larry is having a bear of a time finding the perfect Christmas gift for his eight-year-old daughter, Noel. The season's hottest toy, The Harrison Bear, is all sold out, and Noel's new stepfather wants to keep it that way - so he can be the one to make her holiday wish come true. When Larry learns all Noel wants for Christmas is the bear, he'll stop at nothing to make his little girl happy and get her the toy of her dreams. —Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment christmasslimehousetoydreamlittle girl45 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Two Dads. One Mission. Double the Holiday Fun! Genres Comedy Family Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG for mild rude humor Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Not one single cast member who was in Jingle All the Way (1996) is back in this movie. Goofs Larry gives the age of Noel 3 different times during the movie. The first time is 7 years old, the second time is 8 years old and the third time is 7 years old. Quotes Santa: [Larry sits on Santa's lap] Dude, she's gonna love the doll. Larry: Santa Claus, I'm not leaving your lap until I get that Harrison Bear. Uh, as a matter of fact I've had some Mexican food last night and it's starting to bubble up on me. Oh, you've better give me that bear because if I explode on you, you're going to have to call Roto-Rooter for some backup. Connections Featured in Cinematic Excrement: Jingle All the Way 2 (2014) Soundtracks Jinglin Written and Produced by Alex Geringas and Alex Zamm Performed by Toby Rand User reviews22 Review Top review 1/10 I did this for you all If I ever meet the prouder's or the people behind the making of this movie, I will Simpy grab them by their throats and say the last words their will hear when their still alive, "Now where is your Christmas spirit". I have to admit that the first Jingle All the Way movie with good all Arnold in it was my biggest guilty pleasure of all time, yeah it was stupid and laughably bad but that's guilty Pleasure for you. So after watching this dick demon of hell, but then all my thoughts and opinion came together like metal and magnets; this movie is so god awful and so unbelievable to believe that this movie exists, that it made me respect the first one ever more, and least that had good lines and overall a better story then this garbage of a movie. Just skip this horrid film, it's not worth breaking you're back to see, just skip it not like this unlucky soul. helpful•19 11 MattBrady099 Dec 3, 2014 Details Edit Release date December 2, 2014 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Official Facebook Language English Also known as Babam Söz Verdi 2 Filming locations Fort Langley, British Columbia, Canada Production companies Pace Pictures Twentieth Century Fox WWE Studios See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $5,000,000 (estimated) See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 33 minutes Color Color Related news First teaser trailer for the Woody Woodpecker movie Mar 12Flickeringmyth First Look at Woody Woodpecker Movie Mar 10MovieWeb Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
