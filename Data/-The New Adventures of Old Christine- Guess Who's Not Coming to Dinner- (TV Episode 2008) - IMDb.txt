While Mom uses every subject brought up to mention Christine's status as a divorced woman, Matthew sees his teenage fantasy come true as Lucy sneaks into his room for sex. When Dad is a no show for dinner, Barb theorizes that he was killed by Christine and Matthew's mother, which neither of them can totally discount. —Ron Kerrigan <mvg@whidbey.com> question in episode titlequestion mark in episode titlethanksgiving episodethanksgiving dinnerthanksgiving4 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genre Comedy Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia Brenda doesn't put on an American accent.
