I've watched 2 of the stories (The Golden Arm and Grey Cloud Island) so far (6 episodes) and have to admit that I'm impressed. They are what they are. Lower budget anthologies. But, they're very enjoyable. Don't expect fancy/expensive special effects here. Just 'good ole' camp fire type stories. If you take it at that and don't try to compare it to Million Dollar productions, I'm sure you'll be just as impressed. I won't give any spoilers. Don't you hate it when people give away the horror plot lines? Just watch and enjoy. UPDATE: I've finished watching the rest of the series (Ball of Twine, Scared Stiff, Destino Florida) and each story was equally good. One thing to understand about these stories is that each story is broken down into multiple episodes and each episode is under 10 minutes long. So, while there are 14 episodes in this seasons showing, they make up only 5 Stories. It's a different format. But I truly enjoyed it and I look forward to next season (if this new streaming service is still around then). The season was a Solid 8 Stars! helpful•14 3 collectorofsorts Jun 13, 2020 Details Edit Release date April 6, 2020 (Poland) Also known as 50 States of Fear Filming locations Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada Production companies DiGa Studios Gunpowder & Sky See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 7 minutes Related news Adam Driver-Led ‘65’ From Sam Raimi Going Earlier In Spring 2022 Before ‘Doctor Strange 2’ Oct 28Deadline Film + TV HBO Max Sets Scooby-Doo Programming Block ‘Scoobtober’ for October (TV News Roundup) Sep 29Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Hindi language plot outline for 50 States of Fright (2020)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
