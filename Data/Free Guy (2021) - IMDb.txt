Genres Action Adventure Comedy Fantasy Sci-Fi Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for strong fantasy violence throughout, language and crude/suggestive references Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Serena Van der Woodsen from Gossip Girl (2007) makes a cameo as a player's avatar who gets points for brutality. The player was played by Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds' real-life wife. Goofs Keys tells Millie that there is no button for kissing. However, the second time Guy and Millie kiss, it's Millie, not Guy, who performs the action first. Quotes Chris Evans: [watches Guy use the Captain America shield] What the shit?
