It centers around the notorious Colombian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar (Wagner Moura) and Steve Murphy (Holbrook), a DEA agent sent to Colombia on a U.S. mission to capture him and ultimately kill him. —Soumik Ghosh colombiabased on true storymurderdeceptionjungle320 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines There's no business like blow business. (Season 1) Genres Biography Crime Drama Thriller Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Wagner Moura sees Narcos (2015) as his official entrance in the international film industry, because Elysium (2013) seemed more like an experience, since his character didn't have a big relevance. Goofs Handheld satellite phones the size of a Palm were not sold until the mid 1990s. Systems before that needed a antenna bigger than the one on handhelds. The tracking from airplane is right but they are tracking early analogue cell phones.

Instantly I jumped onto Netflix and I was not disappointed. This is a truly gripping show, one of the best I've seen this year. The characters and acting are done well and the storyline moves at a fast enough pace to get your adrenalin pumping for the whole episode. My only fear was that it would be too generic of a Crime drama, but those feelings were quickly swept away. This is truly an original and thoroughly planned out TV show with a whole lot of heart. Maybe the best on Netflix at the moment. Narco doesn't disappoint with any aspect of the show. It's exciting and fast paced, but above all, it makes you want to keep coming back for more. helpful•395 51 michaelradny Aug 29, 2015 FAQ1 Who is the narrator you hear in the first episode?
