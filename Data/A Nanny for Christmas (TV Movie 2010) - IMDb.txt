It tells the story of Ally (Vaugier), an advertising executive who loses her job just weeks before Christmas. Unable to pay the bills and mortgage she asks her friend, Tina (Thompson) for a lending hand, as her sister works for a top Advertising Agency. Unfortunately, there's some confusion in what positions she's applying for and instead of getting a job in the company Ally is hired to Nanny the bosses kids. One of the saving graces of the film is that the kids are not nasty. So many of these types of film have the children being shown that it's better to be nice than naughty, so as to avoid Santa's naughty list. So what we have is a heartwarming tale of a family pulled apart by ambition and career finding their way back to the right track and getting their priorities straight. The acting, on the whole, is pretty decent, though there are a few moments where Cain does a good job of hamming it up. I'm not too sure if this is intentional, though, for me, the film would have been stronger if his character had been straight and not over the top - as the comedic value was lost to the film. Overall, this is a nice Christmas film that I would recommend to all who love this time of year. It's also a nice family drama and romance, so if you enjoy them then grab a hot chocolate and put your feet up this winter and enjoy. helpful•1 1 Stephen_A_Abell Dec 7, 2017 Details Edit Release date November 23, 2010 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Una niñera por Navidad Filming locations Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, USA Production companies ARO Entertainment Barnholtz Entertainment Hybrid See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $2,000,000 (estimated) See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 30 minutes Color Color Related news What’s Coming & Going From Hulu in November 2021 Oct 22TV Insider Hulu New Releases: December 2020 Nov 29Den of Geek Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was A Nanny for Christmas (2010) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
