Genres Crime Drama Certificate Approved Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Mary Badham (Scout) and Gregory Peck (Atticus) became close during filming, and kept in contact for the rest of his life. Peck always called her "Scout", her character role, while Badham called Peck "Atticus". Goofs When Scout and Jem are debating Jem going back to retrieve his trousers from Boo Radley's, Scout can be seen mouthing Jem's lines (from 0:30:13 to 0:30:39). Quotes Atticus Finch: I remember when my daddy gave me that gun. He told me that I should never point it at anything in the house; and that he'd rather I'd shoot at tin cans in the backyard. But he said that sooner or later he supposed the temptation to go after birds would be too much, and that I could shoot all the blue jays I wanted - if I could hit 'em; but to remember it was a sin to kill a mockingbird. Jem: Why? Atticus Finch: Well, I reckon because mockingbirds don't do anything but make music for us to enjoy. They don't eat people's gardens, don't nest in the corncrib, they don't do one thing but just sing their hearts out for us. Crazy credits The title is revealed in a child's crayon rubbing. Connections Edited into Passage à l'acte (1993) User reviews592 Review Top review 10/10 An utterly moving film, made perfect by the outstanding performance of Gregory Peck. Must see 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is one of the best books ever written but this film does it justice. The performances throughout are stunning, especially that of Gregory Peck (Harper Lee was so impressed she gave him her late father's pocket watch, a prop he uses in the film, to keep). This film will make anyone think hard about how they treat others and it is really heartwarming without being soppy. It isn't necessary to have read the book before seeing this film but it might be advisable. This is one of the classic films of its generation and very few films of nowadays come close to matching it either. A real must-see. helpful•102 32 elliexphant May 11, 2005 FAQ9 What was the medal found by Jem and significant of it? What is 'To Kill a Mockingbird' about? Is 'To Kill a Mockingbird' based on a book?
