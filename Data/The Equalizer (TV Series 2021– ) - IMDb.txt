McCall comes across to most as an average single mom who is quietly raising her teenage daughter. But to a trusted few, she is "The Equalizer" -- an anonymous guardian angel and defender of the downtrodden, who's also dogged in her pursuit of personal redemption. justicefighterwoman warrioraction heroineone woman army13 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines It takes a Queen to Equalize. Genres Action Crime Drama Mystery Thriller Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia The original "Equalizer" starred Edward Woodward and ran for four seasons on CBS between 1985 and 1989. It was then adapted into two feature films starring Denzel Washington in the title role, with the first debuting in 2014 and the second in 2018. Connections Featured in Mediaholic: The Equalizer Review: WOKENESS SUPREME (2021) User reviews301 Review Top review 3/10 How I miss Ed Woodward I watched the 1st episode hoping to rekindle some of that magic from the 1985 TV series starring Edward Woodward. Everything about that series was stellar, including the electrifying theme music composed by ex-Police Stewart Copeland. Everything about this remake is the opposite. The plot's simplistic beyond credibility, the protagonist hardly finds herself in any life threatening situation, and because everything from point A to Z appears as contrived as a 10-piece jigsaw puzzle, there's no suspense to speak of. Sad. I had expected much more from this and from 'Clarice'. Thank goodness for WandaVision. My opinion is based on the first two episodes. helpful•154 40 littlesatanhooves Feb 22, 2021 FAQ2 Is this going to be aired on regular TV?
