Personal Quote: On Spider-Man co-creator Steve Ditko: Steve was certainly one of the most important creators in the comic book business. His talent was indescribable. I worked with him for many years and was always impressed with how he saw everything in terms of photos and pictures and movement and scenes. He told a story like a fine movie director would. I'm sure there will be a lot written about him as time ... See more » Trivia: Admitted he had always hoped to play the character of J. Jonah Jameson in a film adaptation of Spider-Man, though he conceded he was too old to even be considered by the time the film was actually made and praised J.K. Simmons for his performance in the role.
