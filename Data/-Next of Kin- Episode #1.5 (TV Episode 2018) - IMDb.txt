User reviews2 Review Top review 4/10 Episode 1.5 Mona and Guy reunite when their son gets involved in a scuffle at school. More importantly their respective plots converge. Guy's lobbying activities pays off but an important project that gets the go ahead involves a major terrorist funder. Meanwhile Danish needs to get out from his terrorist handlers. He witnesses someone close to him get beaten to a pulp then finds a way to create an explosion so he can call his aunt Mona to assist. At least things happened in this episode but it is mired with a lot of stupidity between the characters. helpful•0 0 Prismark10 Feb 6, 2018 Details Edit Release date February 5, 2018 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Language English Filming locations Hanger Lane Station, Ealing, London, England, UK Production company Mammoth Screen See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour Color Color Sound mix Stereo Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
