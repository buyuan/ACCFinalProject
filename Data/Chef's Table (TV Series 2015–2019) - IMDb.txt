Connections Featured in WatchMojo: Top 10 Netflix Originals (2015) User reviews35 Review Top review 10/10 Beautiful cinematography, fascinating content I normally watch comedy on Netflix but I decided to give this show a try and I fell in love with the stories of these incredibly passionate chefs. The cinematography is breath taking. I feel like I'm watching a nature documentary. The food is beautiful and if it weren't for this show I would never see it because these restaurants are waaaaay outside my price range. helpful•7 0 rivermerchant Jan 19, 2018 Details Edit Release date April 26, 2015 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Official Facebook Official Instagram Language English Also known as Šéfkuchárov stôl Production companies Boardwalk Pictures City Room Creative FINCH See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 50 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 2.00 : 1 Related news Dan Levy’s Cooking Competition ‘The Big Brunch’ Ordered at HBO Max Nov 1Variety Film + TV Marlee Matlin, Jamie Dornan, Harvey Keitel Among 2021 Napa Valley Film Festival Honorees Oct 28Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Japanese language plot outline for Chef's Table (2015)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
