Genres Animation Action Adventure Fantasy Sci-Fi Thriller Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia In the original 1989 dub of Dragon Ball by Harmony Gold, Goku was renamed Zero. Goofs In the original English dub for the episode The Kamehameha wave, Kamehameha is misspelled as Kamehameah on the title screen. Quotes Krillin: Slow down! You know if I lose my grip on you I'll fall through this cloud! Goku: Well if you would stop thinking bad thoughts then it wouldn't be a problem! Krillin: Fat chance. Goku: Hey Krillin look, do you think Master Roshi would like that lady over there? Krillin: You mean I have to look down? Goku that's a man! Goku: Really? How can you tell? Gosh, they all look pretty much the same to me. Krillin: Huh? You're joking, right? I mean you really can't tell the difference? Goku: Well, usually I can figure it out. I just have to touch them first. Krillin: Hmm? In case you couldn't tell, I'm a boy. Goku: Oh! Crazy credits When FUNimation redubbed the original Dragon Ball in 2000, they kept the Japanese intro/outro credit songs, and had English speakers sing them. This was the first time FUNimation kept music from the Japanese version of a Dragon Ball series. Alternate versions There are four different distinct English dubbed versions of this series: a dub from Harmony Gold in 1989 that played very briefly in the US, a heavily edited dub from Kidmark in 1995 that played in several English-speaking countries, an uncut dub from Funimation in 2001 (played edited on US TV) that is shown in only in the US and Australia, and a slightly edited Canadian dub from 2003 that plays only in Canada and in the UK. Connections Alternate-language version of Dragon Ball: Doragon bôru (1986) User reviews45 Review Top review Find the Dragon Balls! What starts off as an unusual re-telling of a Chinese legend called "Journey to the West" immediately turns into into pure madness!! On a twisted version of earth, the amazingly strong child named Son Gokuu goes on a quest to find the magical dragon balls with his friends Bulma and Oolong. Once all 7 dragon balls are gathered and the dragon is called, the sky will darken and the dragon will grant any one wish within its power. Unfortunately, only one wish can be granted per year and after the wish is granted, the dragon balls scatter across the earth and turn into stones. Within 365 days, they will once again become magical dragon balls. Dragon Ball is the funniest anime I have ever seen. From Master Roshi and Oolong's hentai "problems" to Gokuu trying a Kamehameha for the very first time! helpful•13 3 QprP7wuvk Sep 9, 2001 FAQ3 What's going on with Fox's Dragonball movie?
