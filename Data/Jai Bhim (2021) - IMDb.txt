Goofs The film is publicized that the movie is based on real facts. However there are many factual errors in the film. For example, the villain is named in the film as Guru, where the actual person's name is Anthonysamy and victim woman is named as Sengeni in the film, where her real name is Parvathi. Film depicts that the victims belong to Irular community where the actual victims (in real) belong to Kuravar community. Quotes Senggeni: Parvathi Ammal is the true name User reviews2.2K Review Top review 10/10 One of the best movie in todays era.. Splendid and worth every minute. This was one of the best movies I have watched in recent years.. that too based on true facts. Casting, Story, Acting, Direction every small thing made a masterstroke here. Surya as leading actor lawyer and Lijo Mol Jose as Sengoni made a remarkable and splending performance. Bollywood should learn from this type of movies.. or will just make a remake of same with lowest performance with high budget !!! Once again, was very sad on checking the true facts which the movie brought in front with remarkable drama. Hats-off to all actors. helpful•91 15 hxzr-18144 Nov 4, 2021 Details Edit Release date November 2, 2021 (India) Country of origin India Language Tamil Also known as ジャイビム Production company 2D Entertainment See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 2 hours 44 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 Related news Pmk functionary booked for announcing cash award to 'kick' Suriya Nov 17The News Minute Jai Bhim and Karnan: To fight the system from within or outside?
