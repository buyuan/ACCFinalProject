Shawn Spencer (James Roday) makes his living pretending to be. Shawn and his best friend Burton "Gus" Gu ster (Dulé Hill) own a business called "Psych". They are able to stay in business only because of the cases they work with the Santa Barbara Police Department as psychics. Shawn and Gus go through many ups and downs trying to keep the ruse up. Can they pretend forever? Or is the world they built going to come crumbling down? —Joshua Peterson best friendbromanceinterracial friendshipphotographic memoryfake psychic30 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Fake Psychic. Real Detectives. Genres Comedy Crime Mystery Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia As a running gag, in every episode, you'll find a pineapple, the word "delicious", a fist bump, the phrase, "I can't do this right now", and the question "What?" Goofs Gus's company car is a Toyota Echo hatchback, which was only made available to Canadian consumers. Quotes Shawn Spencer: Good morning, detectives! Collecting donations for the Policeman's Ball? Carlton Lassiter: We don't have balls. Shawn Spencer: I honestly have no response for that. Carlton Lassiter: Need I remind you, Mr. Spencer, what happens when you interfere with a police investigation? Shawn Spencer: Uhhh... The case gets solved? Crazy credits Each time a guest performer sings the theme song, they sing the entire song as opposed the shorter version in normal episodes. Alternate versions As of 2018, unlike the ION channel reruns which left the episodes uncut, the Hallmark Channel censors some of the language and suggestive humor despite it being mild. Connections Featured in WatchMojo: Top 10 Buddy Cops on TV (2014) Soundtracks I Know You Know Written by Steve Franks Performed by The Friendly Indians User reviews242 Review Top review 10/10 Well done It is unusual to find an intelligent comedy out there in the TV wasteland, but 'Psych' is unusual in many aspects. The writing is quick, intelligent and witty plus the acting is fast-paced and done in an almost believable way even though the premise would be considered far-fetched by some. The storyline does cause the watcher to look at the clues that are given and try to figure out who did what and to whom. James Roday is perfect for the part that he plays, bringing to the part some of the comic timing and zaniness that he showed in 'Repli-Kate', one of his earlier movies. This series shows that he has refined his craft since then. I hope that this series is given the respect and audience that it deserves helpful•123 18 dmitrirlc Jul 20, 2006 FAQ4 What's with the pineapples? Music featured on the show?
