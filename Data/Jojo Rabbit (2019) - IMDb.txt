Aided only by his idiotic imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi), Jojo must confront his blind nationalism. —Fox Searchlight Pictures nazi germanyworld war twosatiremother son relationshipblack comedy499 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines An anti-hate satire. Genres Comedy Drama War Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for mature thematic content, some disturbing images, violence, and language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Taika Waititi discovered in his research that WWII Germany was very vibrant and fashionable, and was interested in shying away from traditional war films showing it as dreary and dark, instead presenting the town as a seemingly celebratory place and dressing characters as stylishly as possible. He liked the idea that everything seems happy, but just underneath the surface "the third Reich is crumbling, and, you know, the dream is over." Goofs The first time an American soldier is seen waving a flag from a balcony, it is one with 50 stars instead of 48. (A common mistake in WW2 films.) The error is later rectified by showing an American in a Jeep waving a correct 48-star flag. Quotes [Rosie and Jojo come upon six people hanging from a gallows in the town square] Jojo Betzler: What did they do? Rosie: What they could. Crazy credits There is a quote from a poem by Rainer Maria Rilke right before the closing credits: "Let everything happen to you / Beauty and terror / Just keep going / No feeling is final."
