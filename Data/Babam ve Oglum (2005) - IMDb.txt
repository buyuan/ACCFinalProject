On the dawn of September 12, 1980, when a merciless military coup hits the country, they cannot find access to any hospital or a doctor and his wife dies while giving birth to their only child, Deniz. After a long-lasting period of torture, trials, and jail time, Sadik returns to his village with 7-8 years old Deniz, knowing that it will be hard to correct things with his father, Huseyin. —Ali Riza Bolukbasi villagegrandfather grandson relationshipfather son relationshipright wingright winger34 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Give him a room dad, he has no place to go...

A very good choice of cast is the most powerful criterion of the success of the movie. Humeyra, the grandmother is a very talented woman in acting. Emotional scenes become more frequent while we see the movie to get to the end. Unfortunate events make the Turkish people get closer to each other. The movie shows that perfectly. Hospitality, love, grief, laughs... Everything is included in this movie. An emotional breakthrough. The movie also points on the elderly reality -now an impossibility- the torture, made by the cops. Better to be watched by fathers and sons. Also, crying may occur, don't worry; too many people who watched the movie had the same. helpful•220 32 ethernaldreams Dec 12, 2005 Details Edit Release date November 18, 2005 (Turkey) Country of origin Turkey Official site Official site (Turkey) Language Turkish Also known as 我的父亲，我的儿子 Filming locations Seferihisar, Turkey Production company Avsar Film See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross worldwide $18,612,999 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 52 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Film Review: Parinayam (1994) by Hariharan Feb 15AsianMoviePulse Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Babam ve Oglum (2005) officially released in Canada in French?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
