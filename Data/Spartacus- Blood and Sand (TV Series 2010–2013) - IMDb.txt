The Thracians had been persuaded by Claudius Glaber to serve as auxiliaries in the Roman legions in a campaign against the Getae, who had often plundered Thracian lands. However after Glaber reneges on the deal and switches his attentions from the Getae to attack Mithridates in Asia Minor, the Thracians feel betrayed and mutiny. Captured by Glaber, Spartacus is condemned to death as a Gladiator, whilst his wife Sura is condemned to slavery. Spartacus, however, proves to be a formidable gladiator, and defeats the four gladiators tasked with executing him. He becomes a favorite of the crowd, leading Senator Albinius to commute his death sentence to a life of slavery. Spartacus is purchased by Batiatus for gladiator training, who promises to help him find Sura if he proves himself in training. As the series develops, the story follows the betrayals and machinations of Roman life and a tale of one man's heroic quest for vengeance. —WellardRockard gladiatorfemale nudityslavegayviolence106 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Some legends are written in blood. Genres Action Adventure Biography Drama History Romance Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia In September 2010, Andy Whitfield (Spartacus) announced that he would not be able to appear in the second season because he had been diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma and was pursuing aggressive medical treatment. In January 2011, the Starz network announced that Australian actor Liam McIntyre had been chosen to replace Whitfield as Spartacus. In September 2011, Whitfield died at the age of 39. Goofs In several episodes the use of the letter U, for example under the bust that Batiatus made for Spartacus, was seen. The letter U in Latin wasn't used in place of V as consonant until the Middle ages. Quotes Batiatus: Once again, the gods spread cheeks and ram cock in fucking ass! Crazy credits During the series run, each episode has shots from the season as the background while the credits roll. The pictures in the background vary depending on the season. The exception to this being the series finale where a montage of the characters are displayed. Connections Featured in The Wright Stuff: Episode #13.35 (2010) User reviews469 Review Top review So bloody good !! This is not a series for everyone and many people will find a lot in it offensive. They will have good cause. If you are under 16 you should not watch it. Why am i so excited by it then: For the ones that want to see fights, blood, brutality, sex, men looking like gods, blood, erotica, excitement, blood, swearing, allot of skulls being bashed, sweat, savagery, arena fights, honor, friendships intrigues, assassinations, and lets not forget some more blood, this is a show for you. It is brutal and it is one of the best shows out there. It is not a soup opera and if you are one of those people that got excited by a show like CAPRICA skip this one. This show makes your hart race. The first episode is the weakest, but by episode 4 which i just saw i am swearing by all the Roman Gods that this is what i was born to watch. It is raw bloody entertainment! This show is so unique, it is in a category with THE WIRE, thought they have noting in common and their uniqueness lies in completely different places, they are bot light years away of what is being made. For a low budget with computer graphics, after the first weaker episode, the show becomes so realistic, by episode 4 it has griped me in its razor sharp clutches and the downward spiral of darkness is leaving bloody marks on my soul! If you like it you will love it, if you don't like it you will hate it. helpful•400 123 nikolobg Feb 13, 2010 FAQ12 Should I see Blood and Sand before Gods of the Arena, Vengeance or War Of The Damned? What are the differences between the TV Versions and the Extended Blu-ray Versions? Is there a second season?
