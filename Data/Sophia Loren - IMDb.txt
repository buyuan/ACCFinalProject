Personal Quote: Oh, how I loved the movies as a little girl. Particularly I loved Yvonne De Carlo - she was my favorite. Others, too, like Rita Hayworth, but I used to dream that I was Yvonne De Carlo. And I liked that little one - what was her name? - June Allyson, too. But for me there was only one Yvonne De Carlo.
