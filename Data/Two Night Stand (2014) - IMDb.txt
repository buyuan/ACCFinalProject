Genres Comedy Romance Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for sexual material, language and some drug use Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia When Megan asked Alec to dance, he refused, content with watching her. Alec's actor Miles Teller is in fact an expert dancer, who has danced in many movies including Footloose (2011) Goofs The piercing is on the left side of Megan's nose until she goes dancing. When she gets back into the blanket fort, it's on the right. After they leave the fort, it's back on the left side again. Quotes Megan: You are an asshole in so many languages.

I must say this is the type of movie I often prefer at tired days, like when being hungover. It is the classic romantic comedy with intelligent humor and just the right amount of romance. The story is simple with a really targeted ending and you can't get lost in it. Megan (Annaleigh Tipton) is the typical break-up suffering girl who wants to get her life back on track and therefore signs in on a dating site expecting a simple one night stand. She connects with Alec (Miles Teller) and the expected thing happens. However, it gets complicated when a snowstorm blocks her way out of the building/apartment next day, so she is stuck with her yesterday's not much liked lover. I won't continue to sum up the rest because it is really a great pack of funny events, character teasing, good romance and a little educational value that should not be spoiled. To explain the 7 stars: The acting is good and the same is the chemistry between characters/actors. The scenario and dialogs are really good, but the top is definitely the intelligent sense of humor. What I missed is a better directing job which is solid but not good enough to be recognized. Also there is the ending I haven't liked and the lack of some good music. Summed up I recommend the movie, especially at lazy days or for hangover 'treating'. Could also work for a dating movie, try it. helpful•5 1 lukagnamus Aug 29, 2015 Details Edit Release date September 26, 2014 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Official Facebook Official site Language English Also known as İki Gecelik aşk Filming locations New York City, New York, USA Production companies Apartment Two Demarest Films Flynn Picture Company See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross US & Canada $18,612 Opening weekend US & Canada $15,600 Sep 28, 2014 Gross worldwide $492,332 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 26 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 2.39 : 1 Related news ‘Crazy Stupid Love’ Actor Lio Tipton Comes Out as Non-Binary Jun 3Variety Film + TV Analeigh Tipton Joins Blumhouse Thriller ‘Vengeance’ for Focus Features Mar 10Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What was the official certification given to Two Night Stand (2014) in France?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
