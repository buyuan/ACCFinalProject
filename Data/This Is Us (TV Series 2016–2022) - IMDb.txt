The resulting births occurred on the same day as her husband Jack Pearson's thirty-sixth birthday. The lives of Rebecca, Jack and their three offspring - Kevin, Kate and Randall - are presented at different points in time. The Rebecca and Jack stories generally take place during the early stage of their marriage, surrounding the birth of the three children or at different phases of the children's upbringing, which was not always smooth sailing for any of the five. Separate stories concerning Kevin, Kate and Randall are also presented in their adult years, each who has his or her own baggage resulting from that upbringing: Kevin who was generally the neglected one because he had no outward issues; Kate who has always had weight issues; Randall, the gifted one, being the visible outsider and being the "non-K" child. These stories may demonstrate the emotional ties that exist not only because of being family, but also because of four of them having the same birthday and some of them having always been together, meaning since conception. —Huggo family relationshipsfamily dramaflashbacktripletspregnancy35 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines This is real.

Connections Featured in The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon: James Spader/Mandy Moore/Jack White (2016) User reviews644 Review Top review 9/10 It's like looking at love through a window. So, this will be my first official review on IMBD. I believe it's warranted because I have absolutely fallen in love with this show. The writing, the characters, the emotion..everything just feels on par and real. I'm really not much of a TV watcher. This show though, and specifically the relationship between Jack and Kate, reminds me so much of my own relationship and it's just a reminder of how much I love and appreciate the amazing man that I have. This show will make you feel things. I really can't say it any better than that. Leave all of your politics and judgement at the door, and give this a chance. helpful•151 16 missmayhillary Sep 3, 2018 FAQ2 Where can I find a song I heard during the show?` What are the songs from the Pilot Details Edit Release date September 20, 2016 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Instagram: nbcthisisus Instagram: thisisusnbc Language English Also known as 这就是我们 Filming locations Los Angeles, California, USA Production companies Rhode Island Ave. Productions Zaftig Films 20th Century Fox Television See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 45 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news Searchlight Acquires Black List Script ‘The Defender’: Sterling K.
