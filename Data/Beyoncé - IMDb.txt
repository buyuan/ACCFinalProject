Personal Quote: I'm a little messy. Oh, yeah. Whenever I'm out in public, I have to be put together. When I get home, I rebel against it and I don't want to take care of anything. I drop it. I think that is the most difficult thing for him [Jay-Z]. He's very, very organized. See more » Trivia: Nominated for International Album of the Year (for "I Am...
