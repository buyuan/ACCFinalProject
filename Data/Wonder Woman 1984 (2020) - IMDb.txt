With the memory of the brave U.S. pilot, Captain Steve Trevor, etched on her mind, Diana Prince becomes embroiled in a sinister conspiracy of global proportions when a transparent, golden-yellow citrine gemstone catches the eye of the power-hungry entrepreneur, Maxwell Lord. Now, as a dear old friend from the past miraculously enters the picture, and Barbara Minerva, Diana's insecure gemologist colleague gives in to desire, suddenly, deceit, greed, and false promises catapult Maxwell into the limelight. More and more, cataclysmic events push the world to the brink, and emotionally vulnerable Diana must address a cruel dilemma.

Genres Action Adventure Fantasy Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for sequences of action and violence Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Lilly Aspell (Young Diana) performed all the required physical stunt work herself at the age of 12, because it was deemed that she did the job better than her own stunt doubles. Goofs In the shopping mall, Diana destroys the security cameras to keep her secret. This would have not worked. The cameras had already recorded her in action and the tapes are kept in a separate location. Quotes Diana Prince: My father hid Themyscira from the world, and I've been trying to learn how he did it. Steve Trevor: Did what? Diana Prince: Made something invisible. But in 50 years, I've only done it once. Steve Trevor: Well, now is not a bad time to start trying. How long does it last? Diana Prince: I don't know. It was just a coffee cup... and I lost it.

You keep watching this and trying to find someone, something, a scene, a character that is praiseworthy so you find some balance and nada. It is uniformly sordid. The most embarrassing however? The studio that budgeted, approved and released this. The laugh is on them! helpful•24 0 shahram-irani Oct 9, 2021 FAQ11 So this is sequel to Wonder Woman but a prequel to Man of Steel, Batman VS Superman, Justice League, & Aquaman? Why is Blue Monday by New Order used in the trailer when the song was released in 1986, 2 years after the setting of Wonder Woman *1984*?? Any clues about the 80's soundtrack?
