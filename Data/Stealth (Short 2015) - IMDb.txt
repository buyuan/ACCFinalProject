User reviews1 Review Top review 10/10 Should be shown in every middle school Stealth explains the issue of being transgender so well through a story that kids and parents alike can relate to. This should be required viewing in every health class in every middle school. Kristina Hernandez is charming and poignant and wonderful in this. Very courageous. People like Kristina and films like Stealth will help to make schools and communities more welcoming and supportive for all kids. Great script, great concept. The storyline is becoming increasingly familiar as more trans kids begin to attend school as themselves and not allow prejudice to erase their identities. Thank you to the filmmaker. helpful•2 3 kdolan-565-664052 Jan 18, 2015 Details Edit Release date March 23, 2015 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Official site Language English Production companies American Film Institute (AFI) Pink Hoodie Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $55,000 (estimated) See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 22 minutes Color Color Related news Ninth Annual QFest St. Louis – Lgbtq Film Festival Begins Friday at The Hi-Pointe Backlot Apr 20WeAreMovieGeeks.com Ninth Annual Qfest St. Louis – Lgbtq Film Festival Runs April 24-28th at The Hi-Pointe Backlot Mar 29WeAreMovieGeeks.com Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the streaming release date of Stealth (2015) in Australia?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
