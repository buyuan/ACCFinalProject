Quotes Marco: Even strangers know, Spin. And last night wasn't about my shoes. Those guys, they knew... and they bashed me because they hated it, just like you do.

Degrassi: Next generation is not just a show about teens living in the suburbs, going to some high class high school, and living a great teen life. It is following in the same footsteps as its predecessor Degrassi Junior High/Degrassi High. It is a great show for teens today to watch and be addicted to, because I believe it has some pointers for teens today. It deals with Relationships, Experimenting with Drugs/Alcohol, Teen Pregnancy, Relationship Abuse, the dangers of on line chatting, Sexuality, things that really do happen in real life. I my self am an adult in my early 20's and I find my self in front of the T.V. every time it is on, even if it a re-run I still watch it because that is how good this show is. I give this show 4 out of 5 stars. This show truly is a real life show for real life teens. helpful•12 6 BrideofDracula Jan 16, 2004 Details Edit Release date October 14, 2001 (Canada) Country of origin Canada Official site Epitome Pictures Inc.
