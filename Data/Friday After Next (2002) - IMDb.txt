Genres Comedy Drama Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for language, sexual content and drug use Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The character of Roach was written into the original script, but the script was rewritten after the English actor-skateboarder Justin Pierce committed suicide about six months after the release of the previous film Next Friday (2000). Goofs When Pinky's limo hits "Santa", he is thrown high in the air. As he lands, he's about to fall onto the rear of the cab. In the next cut, Santa begins rolling from the front of the limo until he falls of from the rear of the car. Quotes Damon: Craig and Day-Day. Day-Day: Ohh... Damon: Just the niggas I need to see. Craig Jones: Yo, yo... what's up O.G. Triple O.G... O.G. triple... triple O.G.? Day-Day: You got out last night? Damon: I haven't seen ya'll in about 12 years, nigga. Day-Day: I know, I was little... Damon: You're grown up now, though. Give a nigga a hug, dog. Day-Day: I'm about to go... [Craig grabs Day-Day and runs him into Damon] Damon: [Damnon grabs Day-Day] Yeah, man. It's cool, dog. It's cool. Come here. Yeah, right there. Damon: [Damon looks at Craig] Group hug, nigga! Day-Day: Come on, Craig! [Craig walks to Damon] Craig Jones: What's up, dog. Damon: What's up, nigga. Damon: It's good to be home. 'Cause in prison dog, hey... ain't nothing but the fellas, nigga. Day-Day: I heard. Crazy credits The name of the editor (who "cut" the film) gets cut in half with a chainsaw. Alternate versions In the DVD's alternate ending, Santa Claus is revealed to be a homeless man robbing people and stealing their gifts so his children can have a nice Christmas. When The Jones family and Pinky try to attack him and take their stuff back, the children order them to leave their father alone and take their gifts back because they don't need them anyway. Craig feels bad for them and forgives Santa. He lets them keep the presents. The Jones' and Pinky spends Christmas with them in the end.

Having been a fan of the first Friday, my expectations for the second one weren't exactly high [no pun intended], given the fact that Chris Tucker wasn't in it. But it turned out to be an okay movie. I also noticed the direction it took the franchise to -- low brow humor. The first had a little bit of it, but the second one seemed like it just wanted to gross you out with its sick humor and poop jokes. You won't find much difference in this Friday. Turning the series on its ear and giving it a fresh new spin with the Christmas theme seemed like an intriguing idea. Did it work? Hells yeah. With the uncontrollable Mike Epps once again playing the crazy sidekick to Cube's Craig, Chris Tucker seems like a distant memory. Out goes the semi-seriousness of the first one about the reality of the hood, and in comes the all out craziness that solidified the second. The only memorable characters in this one are Money Mike and Damon. If you're a fan of the series, by all means, rent it. By the end of the movie, you'll ponder if this was the best way to close out the trilogy. Was it as funny as they could make it? Memorable? With a stronger script and more reigned-in performances, it could have been. Average at best. But let's hope Cube ends it here. helpful•5 1 rogerebertsclone Dec 1, 2002 FAQ2 Will there be a fourth Friday?
