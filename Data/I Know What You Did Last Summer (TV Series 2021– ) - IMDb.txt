User reviews171 Review Top review 5/10 Average in every way Reading these other reviews, I'm starting to realize that people who say it's "woke" don't actually understand what "woke" is. Nothing about the premier felt forced or out of place. Newsflash! Teens do drugs and have sex with each other. It's called life. The production. Alyeska are good. The acting is serviceable. The problem I see is the "twist" in the 1st episode. It's different, but I can see it being harmful down the road. Especially with the character development of the main actress. For now I rate it a 5 for being exactly what it is, average. Maybe some slick writing will change my mind in future episodes. helpful•17 10 bradbear-65903 Oct 16, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 15, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site link Language English Also known as Jag vet vad du gjorde förra sommaren Filming locations Oahu, Hawaii, USA Production companies Amazon Studios Atomic Monster Original Film See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 45 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Related news I Know What You Did Last Summer EP Sara Goodman Talks Killer Reveal, Season 2 Plans, & More!
