Fikry Ugly Love Last Train to Christmas 8.3 Swan Song Deadlock 6.2 The Feast It Ends with Us 8.2 Flee 7.6 Black Friday Storyline Edit As assistants to the co-CEOs of a publishing company, Lucy Hutton and Joshua Templeman sit across from each other every day - and they hate each other. Not dislike. Not begrudgingly tolerate. H-A-T-E. Lucy can't understand Josh's joyless, uptight approach to his job and refusal to smile, which is in stark contrast to her bright clothes, quirkiness, and effusive people-pleasing. Trapped in a shared office 5 days a week, they've become entrenched in an addictive, ridiculous never-ending game of one-upmanship. Lucy can't let Josh beat her at anything - especially when a huge new promotion to be Managing Director is up for grabs. They strike a deal that whoever does not get the promotion must quit. It's game-on - But as tensions reach boiling point and an innocent elevator ride turns into a steamy kiss, Lucy begins to realize just how fine a line there is between love and hate. rivalry Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines He's the One She Loves to Hate Genres Comedy Romance Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia Robbie Amell was cast in the lead male role but was replaced due to scheduling issues.
