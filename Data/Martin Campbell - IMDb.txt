Romero (3 children) | See more » Children: Campbell, Tomas | See more » Edit Did You Know? Personal Quote: I like pre-production and post the best. I don't like shooting at all. I find it grueling and tough, but I love post and the whole process of seeing the film finally come together. You start ironing out all the rough spots, and the really bad bits you just throw away. So from day one of post to the last day, you see nothing but improvements. Trivia: Directed two James Bond actors in their respective debuts: Pierce Brosnan in GoldenEye (1995) and Daniel Craig in Casino Royale (2006). Campbell had cameo appearances in both films.
