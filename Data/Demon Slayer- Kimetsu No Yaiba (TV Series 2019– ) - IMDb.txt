However, the water-like sword movement is similar to Rurouni Kenshin. Connections Followed by Kimetsu no Yaiba: Mugen Ressha-Hen (2020) Soundtracks Gurenge Lyrics and Performance by Risa Oribe (as LiSA) Arranged by Ryou Eguchi User reviews359 Review Top review 9/10 Breathtaking This show has been given justice, this is a anime that has outdone the manga. Tanjiro our protaganist is unlike many other shonen anime protaganists (one piece: Luffy for example) while Luffy's goal is to become the pirate king, tanjiros goal does not base itself in his growth. It is his will and moral of saving others and furfilling his quest of helping his sister that drives him forward which means that gaining strengh is not the primarily focus which for me adds a new perspective to the show. If you have seen up until episode 19 and you have not rated this show, There really is no convincing you. This show is a masterpiece and you'll be hooked from the first episode! helpful•66 18 Lucasanova May 7, 2019 Details Edit Release date April 6, 2019 (Japan) Country of origin Japan Official sites Official site Official site (Japan) Language Japanese Also known as 鬼灭之刃 Production companies Ufotable Aniplex Ufotable See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 25 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 1.78 : 1 Related news Demon Slayer Season 2: Everything We Know About So Far Nov 17Slash Film Prentice Penny Launches Comic Book Company, Already Developing Two Titles for TV (Exclusive) Nov 5The Hollywood Reporter - Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
