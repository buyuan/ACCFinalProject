Vulgar and staggeringly slow-and-dim-witted, George exhausts the country's money and would surely be dead by now were it not for his dry, angry, bitter, arrogant and cynical butler, Edmund Blackadder, Esq. Blackadder is an ex-aristocrat who has lost his family fortune and been reduced to servant-hood, and full of loathing knowing he should have a better position then serving a lunatic. Sod-Off Baldrick is his dirty, smelly peasant servant, and Mrs. Miggins is an annoying cheerful coffee-shoppe owner who is too stupid to understand most of Mr. Blackadder's insults. —Bloggers! periodbritish humourgeorgian eraregency eraking george iv36 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Macbeth! Genre Comedy Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia Blackadder does not sport a beard in this season of the show because Rowan Atkinson's then-girlfriend hated it. Goofs Although purportedly set during the British Regency (1811-1820), there are appearances by, and contemporary references to, historical figures who were dead before that time, such as Samuel Johnson and Admiral Nelson. Characters use expressions not developed until later, such as "prince and the pauper" or "roller coaster." Quotes Baldrick: [Blackadder slams the door] Something wrong, Mr. B? Blackadder: Oh, something's *always* wrong, Balders... the fact that I'm not a millionaire aristocrat, with the sexual capacity of a rutting rhino, is a constant niggle. Crazy credits In the opening credits, Blackadder roams amongst bookcases. He pulls out books from time to time, upon the spines of which the opening credits are written. Finally, he pulls out a book (upon which the series title is inscribed)... then with a sly wink, he reveals the book is hollow and contains a dirty romance novel. Connections Featured in Laughter in the House: The Story of British Sitcom (1999) User reviews51 Review Top review Intelligent sarcastic humour  the best of British! In England 1790-1815 we follow the continued annals of the Blackadder family. Edmund Blackadder is now butler to Prince George  a man who is as `thick as a whale omelette'. Over 6 episodes his lot goes from the dizzying heights of ruin to disaster to opportunity with little or no help from his dogsbody the `mouse brained' Baldrick. The third in the Blackadder series is not the best (although it's a very close). The scripts are very sharp and typically British. Every word is hilarious and Blackadder is given plenty of juicy lines to throw at his below-average-intelligence master. The plots are ludicrous but inventive  Baldrick accidentally elevated to the house of lords, Blackadder saving the Scarlet Pimpernel, the destruction of the world's first dictionary etc, but they're all carried off with style and great humour. Rowan Atkinson is hilarious  Blackadder is one of his finest hours and he fits the character perfectly. Tony Robinson is cursed forever to be remembered for Baldrick (no matter how many Time Teams he does) and he is brilliant in a thankless role. Hugh Laurie is superb as the stupid Prince and brings inbred stupidity to life! But each episode is also underpinned by a wealth of talent including Helen Atkinson Wood, Robbie Coltrane, Kenneth Moore, Chris Barrie, Ben Elton, Stephen Fry etc. The casting is great. Overall Blackadder is one of the finest British comedy series for decades  it deserves to be up there with Monty Python and the like. Anyone who loves to laugh at intelligent sarcastic humour will love this. One of the best comedy series I've ever seen. helpful•29 0 bob the moo Mar 29, 2002 FAQ5 How does the dictionary survive when it is thrown into the fire? Is the series historically accurate? Are "aardvark" and "sausage" really missing from Samuel Johnson's dictionary?
