Lee Performed by Wintergreen with Jennifer Knowles and Peter E.J. Lee © 2021 Green Winter Records User reviews40 Review Top review 10/10 A wonderful film What a lovely heartwarming film. If you are into the mod culture or not, you will love the characters in this film, especially Sacha Parkinson who shines in every scene she is in. It is hard to believe that this is a micro-budget film due to the excellent cast and superb cinematography that has you immersed in the story of the boy coming to terms with the passing of his father. A feel-good road trip with an excellent soundtrack will have Paul Weller and The Jam fans smiling from ear to ear! Go and see this on the big screen whilst you have the chance, you will remember it for a long time. helpful•9 6 jonathancarl-02472 Aug 28, 2021 Details Edit Release date August 27, 2021 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Official site Official Facebook Language English Also known as The Pebble & the Boy Production company NOW Films See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross worldwide $132,050 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 41 minutes Color Color Related news ‘The Pebble and the Boy’ Review: British Mod Nostalgia Barely Fuels a Sputtering Scooter Road Movie Nov 17Variety Film + TV ‘Free Guy’ passes £11m atop UK-Ireland box office; ‘The Nest’ makes decent start Aug 31ScreenDaily Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the English language plot outline for The Pebble and the Boy (2021)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
