Genres Comedy Crime Drama Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia It wasn't until the fifth season that Allan Hawco, the show's star and among its producers, helped foster a deal with Trifecta Entertainment of Los Angeles to put the show into United States syndication. According to Hawco, owners preferred to keep the show exclusive to Canadian audiences for the first several years to help keep the show "real and truthful to the place"; it's set in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador. Syndication will keep the show, which ended after season 6, playing in U.S. households for years.

User reviews69 Review Top review 8/10 Thumbs up! This show is growing on me. If you had said last season that this show was a little cheesy, I would have agreed. I mean, Jake is right out of the 70's in so many ways. He hasn't really grown up but the show has grown up around him this season in my opinion. The characters are deeper, the plots more complex and interesting, and a lot of the lame situations have been benched in favour of better material. Do Newfoundlanders really talk like that? And what's with the brightly coloured houses? Where can I get a GTO like that? Little glimpses of maritime Canada I suppose. If you're looking for realism and big-budget effects, you won't find satisfaction here. But this show is good fun and a reliable source of entertainment. Good work! helpful•38 6 andrew.r.w Feb 8, 2011 FAQ1 Why are so many cops Irish?
