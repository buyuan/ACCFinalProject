Connections Featured in The 25th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards (1973) User reviews8 Review Top review 10/10 Bring Back The After School Special I am a woman that was born in 1965. The times were very different then. Since I have become an adult, I realize that back then, things weren't so bad. I think that every generation views their coming up as harder than the one before theirs. I am a writer. In each book that I write, I try and provide hope and encouragement to the reader. My work covers practical situations that people experience every day. My most recent work is about drug addiction. Whether the reader be an addict themselves or a loved one of someone addicted to drugs, I tried to provide love and support and suggestions that would help either. When I was about half way through this book, I mentioned to my husband, my memory of the ABC After School Special and how vital a program of that nature was at that time. I think that it's a travesty that a program of such high impact, could be replaced with the likes of Judge Judy. In 1975, when I was just ten years old, I watched these After School Specials, every day after school. I enjoyed them. Even though I didn't realize that over 30 years later I would recall not only watching them but all of these years later, FEEL the impact of these shows and appreciate their invaluable message. Our children need these types of programs. Television has become a poison for our young viewers, glorifying violence and sick behavior. They are being programmed to grow into warped adults. Bring back the After School Specials. Let's arm our children with lessons that will enhance their chances of becoming caring adults. In the meantime, I will continue to write material that hopefully can help achieve this to some small extent. helpful•18 8 dwhilion Feb 27, 2008 Details Edit Release date October 4, 1972 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Historias familiares Production company American Broadcasting Company (ABC) See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour Color Color Sound mix Stereo Mono Aspect ratio 1.33 : 1 Related news From ‘Sabrina’ to ‘Steven Universe,’ Family-Friendly TV Has Grown a Social Conscience Nov 13Indiewire Random Roles: Of all his films, Rob Lowe wants you to go back and watch Bad Influence Feb 8avclub.com Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Spanish language plot outline for ABC Afterschool Specials (1972)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
