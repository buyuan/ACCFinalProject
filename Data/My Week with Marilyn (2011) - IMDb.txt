Young Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne), an eager film student, wants to be involved and he navigates himself a job on the set. When movie star Marilyn Monroe (Michelle Williams) arrives for the start of shooting, all of London is excited to see the blonde bombshell, while Olivier is struggling to meet her many demands and acting ineptness, and Colin is intrigued by her. Colin's intrigue is met when Marilyn invites him into her inner world where she struggles with her fame, her beauty, and her desire to be a great actress. —napierslogs marilyn monroe characterlaurence olivier charactervivien leigh characterjack cardiff characterarthur miller character83 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Genres Biography Drama Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for some language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The reenactments of scenes from The Prince and the Showgirl (1957) were filmed on the same soundstage as the original. Goofs A frustrated Olivier tells Colin that he should have cast Vivien to play Elsie instead of Marilyn. Marilyn bought the rights to "The Sleeping Prince" from its author Terence Rattigan, and hired Olivier, who agreed to co-produce the film, to direct; she could not be replaced. Quotes Marilyn Monroe: Little girls should be told how pretty they are. They should grow up knowing how much their mother loves them. Connections Featured in Maltin on Movies: The Muppets (2011) Soundtracks When Love Goes Wrong (Nothin' Goes Right) Written by Harold Adamson and Hoagy Carmichael Performed by Michelle Williams Published by EMI First Catalog Inc., Peer Music (UK) Ltd (c/o Songs of Peer Ltd) Courtesy of The Weinstein Company Arranged and Produced by David Krane User reviews244 Review Top review 8/10 Good Movie- Nice Period Piece I liked this movie, it was a non-judgemental re-telling of a slice of history. I thought the performances were all very good by the leading characters. I have no idea what the real Marilyn was like and I don't think many people do, but Michelle Williams character is a more than plausible interpretation, vulnerable at times, manipulative at others, who really knows where the reality lies, but there was something for everyone's interpretation. The movie did a good job of depicting that moment in time and transporting the audience there for a couple of hours. I guess it is every man's fantasy to have this opportunity, so the story is a satisfying one for any man who has ever wondered what the real Marilyn may have been like. helpful•32 11 chickenlittle-309-990263 Mar 8, 2012 FAQ1 What happened to Colin Clark after the events of this movie?
