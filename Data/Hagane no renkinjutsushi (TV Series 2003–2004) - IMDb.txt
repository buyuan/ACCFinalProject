Deciding to perform a forbidden human transmutation to bring their mother back, they end up losing their bodies. Now Edward must join the military in order to gain certain alchemical privileges, with his one goal being to restore his brother to his original state. But with war on the horizon it's only a matter of time before they are both forced to question their morals and ultimately decide the value of human life. —Anonymous militaryartificial humansupernatural powersteampunkgenocide76 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines The Philosophers' Stone: those who possess it, no longer bound by the laws of Equivalent Exchange in Alchemy, may gain without sacrifice, create without equal exchange.

Genres Animation Action Adventure Comedy Drama Fantasy Sci-Fi Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Nearly every member of the military (Mustang, Hawkeye, Fury, Havoc, Hughes, and even Riza's dog, Black Hayate) is named after some type of mid-20th century military aircraft. Most of them are WWII-era airplanes. The exception to the aircraft rule is Bradley, who seems to be named after a modern APC, which was named after WW2 General Omar Bradley. Quotes Roy Mustang: [about his first day if he were the Fuhrer] On that day, all female officers will be required to wear... tiny miniskirts! [Strikes pose] Crazy credits In the end credits of the first episodes, you see a close-up of Ed who "turns to the camera" and casts a faint smile. In the 7th episode though - a tragic one, Ed's smile breaks into a big grin while his eyes are shining like he's about to cry.

In general, I watch it if it happens to be on, but more as background noise than for the actual plot content. But this series changed my mind about all that. The first few episodes I watched were on Adult Swim. I liked the idea of magic being explained in a (somewhat) scientific fashion, so I found recordings of the aired episodes online (with subtitles) with the intention of watching them whenever I was bored. I say without shame that I, who have not watched more than a half hour of anime in a single sitting, watched all fifty-one episodes in a single sitting. And it had me sitting on the edge of my seat every time. When a few of the episodes were corrupted, I even edited the videos manually with a hex editor to get them to play properly. I was really turned off to Anime originally because of the way the Japanese animators use frame rates. You only really need one or two frames per second to show movement--and this contrasts with the relatively constant frame rate in American cartoons. It can look rather ugly if you're not used to it. For action scenes, though, they bring out the full 30fps, and the sudden contrast between 2fps, with the character standing there, and 30fps, where the character is executing these stunning martial arts moves, is an incredible sight to see. But I would like to say that this series is a complete series. The last episode does, in fact, contain the conclusion--no premature terminations here. Most anime contains a "Lead-out" which gives the viewer something to think about. It makes it seem more like the characters are still doing something, still living, even after the series is over. I must say that makes the end of the series even harder to bear, because believe it or not, it's like saying goodbye to a close friend. This series has definitely had a major impact on me. It is worth the time (or money) to acquire it. I wouldn't recommend watching all fifty-one episodes together like I did. The intrigue of the plot is intended to hit the viewers like a hammer, and it keeps them coming back week after week. If you watch them all together, it begins and ends so quickly you feel like you've been hit by a truck when it finally DOES end. Full Metal Alchemist is a prime example of excellent story writing. It'll make you laugh and maybe even make a few of you cry, but one thing it won't do is leave you disappointed. helpful•220 16 JayDSan Sep 22, 2005 Details Edit Release date October 4, 2003 (Japan) Country of origin Japan Official sites adult swim Official site Language Japanese Also known as Fullmetal Alchemist Production companies Aniplex Bones Mainichi Broadcasting System (MBS) See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 24 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 1.33 : 1 Related news Trailer: Love of Kill by Hideaki Oba Nov 15AsianMoviePulse Best Anime Box Sets: ‘Naruto,’ ‘Attack on Titan,’ and More Mangas to Collect Jul 26Indiewire Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
