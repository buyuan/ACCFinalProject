After witnessing a woman's suicide, Sarah assumes the stranger's identity - who happens to look just like her. Expecting to solve all her problems by cleaning out the dead woman's savings, Sarah is instead thrust headlong into a kaleidoscopic mystery as she realizes the dizzying truth - she and the dead woman are clones. As Sarah searches for answers, she discovers the chilling fact that there are more people like her out there - genetically identical individuals who were planted in unsuspecting birth parents and nurtured in completely different circumstances. With no idea who created the clones, she'll need to discover the reason in a hurry as an assassin is killing them one by one. —Annonymous female protagonistsuicidebrainwashed assassinmad scientistgenetic enhancement32 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines She's been duped. Genres Action Drama Sci-Fi Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Tatiana Maslany said in an interview that she has a continuity team that keeps her from mixing up the characters. For instance, if she's doing a scene that has both Alison and Sarah in it and she's playing Alison, if the script tells her to roll her eyes, they make sure it's an 'Alison' eye roll and not a 'Sarah' eye roll. Goofs Cosima mentions in season 1 that Katja's fingerprints would be close enough to Sarah's that running Katja's prints through standard police search would pull up Sarah's rap-sheet. No one seems worried that Beth's fingerprints should have been just as similar, and as a police officer her prints would definitely be in the system. Why didn't Sarah's rap-sheet emerge when Beth applied to become a police officer? Why did the system match Katja to Sarah but not to Beth? The system may have matched Sarah to Beth, but other data would not have matched, such as date of birth, place of birth, parents etc. The match would have been seen as a false positive which often occurs in fingerprint matching systems. Even in ten-print matches, depending on what level of search was employed. In many systems, technician intervention is required to eliminate candidate matches.

This is not your regular Scfi show where we know all the protagonists and villains in the first episodes( and thats when it starts to fizzle out)With Orphan Black the potential for additional mind-blowing characters is endless ! Its like Scfi soap opera, you never know who is going to walk through the door. Kudos to Tatiana for her ability to keep in character almost all the time. I actually think she has the record over Eddie Murphy in terms of most diverse characters and yes it does look very down to earth in the characterization i.e soccer moms and students but I think thats makes Orphan Black urban , hip and unique. Love to see where it goes from here. helpful•148 72 enwange-biz Apr 18, 2013 FAQ4 Where is Orphan Black set? What are the actors' real life accents? Why is this program called "Orphan Black"?
