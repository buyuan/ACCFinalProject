In this isolated and sometimes inhospitable environment, the team have to rely on a uniquely resourceful style of policing. Set against a hauntingly beautiful landscape, Shetland is based on the best selling books such as Red Bones, Raven Black, Dead Water and Blue Lightning. —ahmetkozan scotlandlocation in titlecrime dramashetland islands scotlandpolice investigation9 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Crime Drama Mystery Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Despite the fact that the Shetland Islands are the most northerly place in the UK and can have very rain any month of the year, sprinklers were used to create fake rain in some of the scenes. Connections Featured in The Wright Stuff: Episode #19.45 (2014) User reviews135 Review Top review 8/10 Second Season - 5-7/8 Great episodes out of 6 The 6 episode second season is a gripping, complex tale with not just the one murder that starts it, but eventually a handful. Characters and plot are introduced and revealed bit by bit, in a way that keeps you wanting more. It is like three or four different onions that are peeled back one at a time, you just are never sure which one is being peeled, and whether it is a good one or a bad one. Eventually they start to come together, but never in quite the way you might have guessed. The ultimate denouement is action packed - right up to the last 10 minutes of the series. Then the whole plot is revealed in a highly improbable manner in a monologue by a single character, with even a key fact being announced when the character could have had no knowledge of it. So disappointing after such a riveting series. I was ready to rate the series a 10 until the last 10 minutes. But don't let this deter you from watching it - other than that the show is really good. helpful•12 1 cmoon-42291 Sep 19, 2016 FAQ3 How is Duncan related to DI Perez's daughter? It is mentioned in the first episode "Red Bones" that Duncan left her when she was an infant. How is that possible when Perez and his wife are the parents? And who is Duncan's wife Mary? Just started watching Series 4. LOVE this show but I would love to know how it is that D.I. Perez affords a new car every year. :D Why don't we see DIs and policemen carrying guns in the series?
