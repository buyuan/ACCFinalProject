But when he grew up, he couldn't get work. So he and his brother, Ed start their own talent agency that specializes in child acts. They can't seem to find the next big thing, and they have to deal with another agency who's not above bribery to get the kids to sign with them. One day, Michael meets a girl named Angie and she's a real spitfire. Michael thinks she could be what they are looking for. Problem is, is that she has a big chip on her shoulder. —rcs0411@yahoo.com reference to astrologyreference to a zodiac signreference to scorpio the astrological signreference to scorpio the constellationchild46 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines He's a talent agent.

Goofs When Mikey backs the car out to drive to Elmira, he backs into a wall and we hear tail lights breaking. But when he arrives at the rehab facility, we can clearly see that the tail lights are intact. Quotes Barry Corman: [after vomiting in a hat] Never again. From now on, it's only Kosher franks.

Worth a view. I haven't watched this movie in a long time, but it still holds clear in my mind: Michael J Fox is a child actor turned talent agency rep. The gist is that they are going down the tubes and it will take a definite miracle to pull things back together. Fox is charming to the last, and also brings light to an issue that was becoming more and more prominent in the early 90's- smoking and trying to quit. Nathan Lane was very funny and sociable with Fox in this film, and Angie was a devious, but reliable kid. I didn't realize Cyndi Lauper was Geena until I wrote this summary. I've heard about her being a celeb, but I didn't realize I had a film with her in it. helpful•15 6 w1cht3l Mar 15, 2002 Details Edit Release date June 4, 1993 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as 福星急轉彎 Filming locations New York City, New York, USA Production company Touchstone Pictures See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross US & Canada $12,440,858 Opening weekend US & Canada $3,606,279 Jun 6, 1993 Gross worldwide $12,440,858 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 31 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Michael J.
