Duke Leto Atreides : A great man doesn't seek to lead; he is called to it. But if your answer is no, you'd still be the only thing I ever needed you to be: my son. [from teaser trailer] Gaius Helen Mohiam : The test is simple. Remove your hand from the box, and you die. Paul Atreides : What's in the box? Gaius Helen Mohiam : Pain. Paul Atreides : [to Stilgar] My father came, not for spice, not for the riches, but for the strength of your people. My road leads into the desert. I can see it. If you'll have us, we will come. Gaius Helen Mohiam : You've proven you can rule yourself. Now you must learn to rule others, something none of your ancestors learnt. Paul Atreides : My father rules an entire planet. Gaius Helen Mohiam : He's losing it. Paul Atreides : He's getting a richer one. Gaius Helen Mohiam : He'll lose that one too. Paul Atreides : There's something happening to me. Something waking up in my mind. I can't control it. Gaius Helen Mohiam : What did you see? Paul Atreides : There's a crusade coming. Paul Atreides : This is an extermination. They're picking my family off one by one. [Paul is to practice fencing with Gurney] Paul Atreides : I guess I'm not in the mood today. Gurney Halleck : Mood? What's mood to do with it? You fight when the necessity arises, no matter the mood. Now fight! [the two begin fighting, and Paul eventually puts his blade to Gurney's throat] Gurney Halleck : I see you found the mood. Paul Atreides : [to Jessica] My road leads into the desert. I can see it. Paul Atreides : Get away from me! You did this to me! Your Bene Gesserit turned me into a Freak! Paul Atreides : [while having a vision] That's the future. It's coming. Holy war spreading across the universe like unquenchable fire. Lady Jessica Atreides : Paul, you're scared. I can see it. Tell me, please, what do you fear? Paul Atreides : Somebody help me, please. Lady Jessica Atreides : Paul. Paul Atreides : It's coming. I see a holy war spreading across the universe like unquenchable fire. A warrior religion that waves the Atreides banner in my father's name. Lady Jessica Atreides : Paul. Paul Atreides : Fanatical legions worshipping at the shrine of my father's skull. A war in my name. Everyone shouting my name! [repeated line] Paul Atreides : Desert power. Duncan Idaho : Look at you. You put on some muscles. Paul Atreides : I did? Duncan Idaho : No. Paul Atreides : How dare you use the voice on me?
