Growing up she would adopt the alias Flamebird (and later Hawkfire) in response to her counterpart's development as Nightwing. In the comics she is Kate Kane's younger cousin instead of her step-sister. Goofs Batwoman clearly has black paint around her eyes whenever she wears the cowl. But whenever she takes the cowl off, there's never any paint around her eyes. This happens in several episodes and is common amongst many superhero/comic book shows with masked characters. Crazy credits The Warner Bros and DC Comics logos are colored red and black (Batwoman's colours), are set in Gotham City and have bats flying around. Connections Featured in Geeks + Gamers: Woke Batwoman Trailer: The Definition of Cringe (2019) User reviews1.3K Review Top review 3/10 How was this green lit? I wanted to like this. I've seen all the DC shows in the last few years but this is one I can't continue even if I was paid too. 3/10 is being VERY generous. The screenplay alone is TERRIBLE. Characters aren't relatable at all, not to mention the acting is very sub-par. Once you get deeper into the first ep things become so predictable. I'm all for inclusiveness but its 2019 and this show trys to go all out with straight, bi, lesbian relationships.. and somehow misses the mark on every level. Almost nobody seems to be pleased at all, which is very telling. Ruby can do her own stunts and get injured all she wants. The action doesn't make up for the rest unfortunately. Just watch it if you must but be prepared to want an hour of your life back! helpful•748 320 kboz25 Oct 7, 2019 FAQ2 What kind of photography was used in this production? In nearly every scene you´ve got a sharp center spot which washes out to the edges of the picture. Saw this in no other Arrowverse production.
