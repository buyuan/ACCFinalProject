Intelligence expert David Grant suspects another reason and convinces the military that the 'plane should not be allowed to enter U.S. airspace. An assault mission is devised, using a specially equipped 'plane designed for mid-air crew transfers, and Grant finds himself aboard the 747 with a team of military anti-terrorists who have to defuse a bomb and overpower the terrorists. —Ron Kerrigan <mvg@whidbey.com> panicsurvivalstealth planemissiondisaster film261 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Fasten your seat belts Genres Action Adventure Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for violence and brief language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia According to John Leguizamo in his autobiography, Steven Seagal physically attacked him during filming, in an effort to scare the cast and crew. Leguizamo claimed that he had laughed at something that Seagal said, thinking it was a joke, but Seagal proved him wrong by elbowing him against a wall. Goofs Armed federal air marshals aren't listed as such on passenger manifests, since their modus operandi (and the extent to which they are used on commercial airplanes) is classified. Quotes Rat: I hope there's a good movie on this flight. Alternate versions The German theatrical, video and DVD version has the same cuts as the UK version. Apart from that, all Arabian language has been dubbed into German, whereby all references to Islam and Allah were replaced by more harmless lines.

A fun, tense, and exciting action/thriller with an excellent ensemble cast, headed by Kurt Russell and including Halle Berry, David Suchet, and John Leguizamo. Even Steven Seagal does a creditable job, mainly because this isn't a "Steven Seagal movie." His supporting role permits him to do what he does best (which isn't acting). He doesn't have to pretend to be witty, there's none of that awful smirking he does in a vain attempt to show emotion, the camera doesn't caress his body, and there's not one speech about how gol-dang *good* his character is. He even manages to enunciate his lines clearly! The plot might have seemed a little far-fetched when the movie was released, but not anymore. I'm not even much of an action film fan, but this one is really a lot of fun. helpful•72 24 counterrevolutionary Jan 4, 2003 FAQ5 What is Executive Decision about? Is it true that Steven Seagal held up production because he didn't want to film his death scene? What are the differences between the British BBFC 15 version and the uncut version?
