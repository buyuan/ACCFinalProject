However, what should be a fairly simple project is stymied at every turn by oafish bureaucrats, selfish neighbors, governmental red tape, and a myriad of other challenges. Leslie's colleague Tom Haverford, who delights in exploiting his position for personal gain, is as likely to undermine her efforts as to help her, while her boss, Ron Swanson, is adamantly opposed to government in any form, even though he's a bureaucrat. —Sorbe mockumentaryfeminismpolitical satireabsurd comedyindiana33 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Because parks don't grow on trees. Genre Comedy Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Chris Pratt (Andy) was such a good physical comedian that frequently the writers would just write "Andy does something physical" into the script, trusting he would come up with something in the moment. Goofs There is conflicting information in regards to the location of Eagleton. In season two, Leslie (Amy Poehler) states that Eagleton is "two towns over." However, later on, there is a "Pawnee/Eagleton border," meaning the towns are next to each other, some Pawnee citizens having left and settled Eagleton. Quotes Ron Swanson: What religion am I? I'm a practicing "mind your own f***ing business!" Connections Edited into Parks and Recreation: Dammit Jerry! (2012) User reviews364 Review Top review 8/10 Two shows in one. This show is really two shows. Pre season three and post season three. Before season three the show was like the office, the main character is an idiot doing the best they can but failing. The show has very awkward humor and is really funny. Post season three the show becomes very light hearted and goes for more the comedy the show is known for. It's about a smart capable main character who is a bit weird going against a bad system. The show is really good and it can be very funny but the change is jarring and I know people who only like post season three and people who only like preseason three, I think this is also reflected by some reviews. I recommend the characters are awesome. helpful•208 18 fpuwasabadpresident Jun 27, 2018 FAQ1 Which Parks and Recreaction episodes have extended producers cuts?
