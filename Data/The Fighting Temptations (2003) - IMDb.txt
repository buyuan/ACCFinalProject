After being fired, his life is further shaken by his debtors who had counted on paying after landing the account. Having to go on the run, he is called back to his southern town roots, when his great aunt dies. At the reading of the will, he learns he has been asked to assume the mantle of choir director of his great aunt's church and if he can get the choir in the Gospel Explosion in Atlanta, he will inherit stock worth $150,000. Unfortunately the choir leaves a lot to be desired and he has to start recruiting. Among others, he gets three prisoners to join. More importantly, he gets a "sinner" from one of the local night clubs to join. While initially scorned and resisted, nonetheless her voice wins everyone but the hardcore church busybody. —John Sacksteder <jsackste@bellsouth.net> taxi drivercell phonechurchadvertisinggospel choir60 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines She was one temptation, he couldn't resist Genres Comedy Drama Music Romance Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for some sexual references Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Chloe Bailey played the character of Little Lilly while Beyonce played the character at an older age.

Walter Williams Sr.: He Still Loves Me (2003) Soundtracks I'm Getting Ready By Shirley Caesar Performed by Ann Nesby Produced by Bubba Smith Ann Nesby performs courtesy of It's Time Child Records/Universal Records User reviews66 Review Top review 10/10 Fun & Funky Film This movie was about a man named Darrin (Cuba Gooding Jr.) who returns to his hometown from New York City to read the will of his aunt who passed away. While he is there, he comes into contact with the other characters of the town (Montecarlo, GA) and he stumbles upon his old fling Lily (Beyoncé Knowles). Darrin's aunt leaves him in charge of leading the local church choir to a gospel championship. This was one of the greatest movies i've seen. I'm a huge fan of Beyoncé, so to see Beyoncé in this movie doing her thing is a dream for me. The movie has it's good and bad parts. The acting is great. The soundtrack is even greater. I think that this film would be more accepted by the African-American group. I myself am African-American and there are some parts in this movie where I think only African-Americans will get. It's an A+ Job. Cuba was hilarious in this movie. Not one of his best, but definitely great. helpful•14 5 maa628 Jul 12, 2004 Details Edit Release date September 19, 2003 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Borilačko iskustvo Filming locations Georgia, USA Production companies Paramount Pictures Handprint Entertainment MTV Films See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $30,000,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $30,250,745 Opening weekend US & Canada $11,758,372 Sep 21, 2003 Gross worldwide $33,972,062 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 2 hours 3 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital DTS Aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 Related news Spelman College Names Arts Center After Alumna Latanya Richardson Jackson and Samuel L.
