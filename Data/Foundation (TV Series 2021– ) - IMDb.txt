Connections Referenced in Conversations with Hollywood: Writing Science Fiction & Fantasy (2011) User reviews1.1K Review Top review 5/10 So little happening This show is so disappointing. It feels to me unnecessarily drawn out and so little of consequence happens each episode. I really was looking forward to this show as I read the books so long ago. I'm ok with it being different but tedious and padded out don't work for me. There are enjoyable aspects but they are not enough to redeem the show. helpful•65 16 markvnoonan Oct 15, 2021 FAQ3 Is this based on the Asimov Foundation series? Is the series based on the original trilogy, or the entire Foundation series (and thus ties in with all of Asimov's future history)? Which other streaming services will Foundation Show on?
