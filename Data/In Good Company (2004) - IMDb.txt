He's in love with you and he's your dad's boss. Genres Comedy Drama Romance Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for some sexual content and drug references Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The studio wanted someone from the cast of That '70s Show (1998) for the role of Carter and had originally given it to Ashton Kutcher. Kutcher dropped out due to creative differences, and Topher Grace auditioned and got the part. Grace had auditioned four times for the role, and had to convince producer Paul Weitz that he was right for the role, by highlighting his raising by his father, a businessman with sharp negotiation skills. Goofs When Carter Duryea is first meeting his staff, the boom microphone operator is reflected in the windows behind him. Quotes Carter Duryea: Dan, you seem to have the perfect marriage. How do you do it? Dan Foreman: You just pick the right one to be in the foxhole with, and then when you're outside of the foxhole you keep your dick in your pants. Carter Duryea: That's poetic. Connections Featured in The Rotten Tomatoes Show: The Road/Ninja Assassin/Old Dogs (2009) Soundtracks Glass, Concrete & Stone (2002) Written by David Byrne Performed by David Byrne Courtesy of Nonesuch Records By Arrangement with Warner Strategic Marketing User reviews221 Review Top review 9/10 Reminds me of Good Will Hunting Honest. Unpredictable... not neat and tidy like many romantic comedies. Outside of one Steely Dan song, the soundtrack makes the movie feel a bit slow-- however... the one liners make up for it. Carter (Grace) has one line to Alex (Johannson) while in her dorm room that is just awesome... think As Good as it Gets awesome... will purchase this one... It had a Good Will Hunting (one of my faves) feel to it... those are rare. Great date movie as well. It is more than a renter. See this one in the theater. Simply put, a great flick. It is so often that one (me anyway) sits in a theater able to predict the next line, action, etc. It is refreshing to walk away satisfied with an ending one could not have guessed. helpful•56 39 LSmith-29 Dec 16, 2004 Details Edit Release date January 14, 2005 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Official site (Russia) Language English Also known as Synergy Filming locations 7th & Hope Streets, Downtown, Los Angeles, California, USA Production companies Universal Pictures Depth of Field See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $26,000,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $45,806,659 Opening weekend US & Canada $151,750 Jan 2, 2005 Gross worldwide $61,315,215 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 50 minutes Color Color Sound mix DTS Dolby Digital SDDS Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Dennis Quaid To Star In Family Drama ‘The Hill’ From ‘Hoosiers’ & ‘Rudy’ Scribe Angelo Pizzo Aug 16Deadline Film + TV Scarlett Johansson To Receive 35th Annual American Cinematheque Award In November Jun 22Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was In Good Company (2004) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
