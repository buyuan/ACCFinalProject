When Margaret, a Canadian, faces deportation for an expired visa, she hatches a scheme to marry Andrew - he agrees if she'll promise a promotion. A skeptical INS agent vows to test the couple about each other the next Monday. Andrew had plans to fly home that weekend for his grandma's 90th, so Margaret goes with him - to Sitka, Alaska - where mom, dad, and grams await. Family dynamics take over: tensions between dad and Andrew, an ex-girlfriend, Andrew's dislike of Margaret, and her past color the next few days, with the INS ready to charge Andrew with fraud. —<jhailey@hotmail.com> alaskaimmigration fraudfake marriagecoworker relationshipmarriage proposal130 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Here comes the bribe... Genres Comedy Drama Romance Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for sexual content, nudity and language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Betty White almost turned down her role in the film because filming would require her to spend ten weeks away from her golden retriever. Goofs When Andrew is running with the Starbucks lattes in the beginning of the film water can be seen spilling out of one of the cups as he enters the building. Quotes Andrew Paxton: Three days ago, I loathed you. I used to dream about you getting hit by a cab. Then we had our little adventure up in Alaska and things started to changed. Things changed when we kissed. And when you told me about your tattoo. Even when you checked me out when we were naked. But I didn't realize any of this, until I was standing alone... in a barn... wifeless. Now, you could imagine my disappointment when it suddenly dawned on me that the woman I love is about to be kicked out of the country. So Margaret, marry me, because I'd like to date you. Crazy credits SPOILER: During the first half of the end credits there are various clips of Mr. Gilbertson (the immigration "detective") interviewing Margaret, Andrew, Ramone (the "stripper"), Grace and Joe (Andrew's mom and dad), and Grandma Annie. Alternate versions There is an alternate ending to the film in which the plane in which Margaret is going to New York comes back to Sitka Airport and Ryan Reynolds' final speech takes place over there only Connections Featured in The Rotten Tomatoes Show: Taking of Pelham 123/Imagine That/Moon (2009) Soundtracks Relax Written by Peter Gill, Holly Johnson (as William Johnson), and Mark O'Toole Performed by Frankie Goes to Hollywood Courtesy of ZTT Records Ltd. User reviews366 Review Top review 7/10 Charming though Predictable Most charming Sandra Bullock movie since While You Were Sleeping, though quite a bit more predictable. (Anyone who knows the general premise can guess how the movie is going to play out.) But it was funny and sweet, and if you need to choose something to take your wife/girlfriend to, choose this one. Sandy's attempting a Miranda Priestly-type character (Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada) which doesn't actually suit her acting style very well, but when you get used to her she's fun to watch. And she has great comic timing. So does Ryan Reynolds for that matter, who has a way of just looking perplexed that can make you snicker. helpful•53 16 CSHaviland Aug 1, 2009 FAQ5 Is "The Proposal" based on a book? Isn't Sandra Bullock significantly older than Ryan Reynolds? Is Sitka, Alaska, a real town?
