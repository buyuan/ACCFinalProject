We tell each other lies about the fight for free will and independence, but we don't really want that. We want to be told how to live and then die when we're not looking. People want oblivion, and a few of us are born to build it for them. So here I am - their invisible god sneaking under their skin. James Bond: You know, history isn't kind to men who play God. Lyutsifer Safin: And you don't? We both eradicate people to make the world a better place. I just want it to be... tidier. 31 of 31 found this interesting Interesting?
