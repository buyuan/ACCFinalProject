Aided by a remarkably strong support cast (Charlotte Ritchie is spellbinding here particularly - and you keenly miss Sophie Thompson in the second series) but all oscillating around a mesmerically layered performance from Martin. Feel Good can really genuinely hurt you but there's a powerful strength to it to. Deeply underrated and not to be ignored. helpful•3 0 owen-watts Oct 12, 2021 Details Edit Release date March 18, 2020 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Language English Also known as Mae and George Filming locations Manchester, England, UK Production companies Objective Fiction Channel 4 Television See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 30 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news Every IndieWire TV Review from 2021 So Far, Ranked by Best to Worst Grade Nov 8Indiewire The Flight Attendant Season 2 Storyline Revealed (Hint: It's Killer) — Plus, Who's Joining the Cast Full-Time?
