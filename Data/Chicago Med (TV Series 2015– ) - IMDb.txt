Connections Featured in Late Night with Seth Meyers: America Ferrera/Oliver Platt/Judah Friedlander/Brian Chase (2015) User reviews166 Review Top review 7/10 Watchable, but the South African accent is terrible It's a good watch, not quite ER standards. One annoying point is the terrible South African accent of the character Ava Bekker. It's incredibly fake. helpful•9 2 linda-810-619219 Apr 5, 2020 FAQ2 Chicago PD is all over the cable channels , why are Chicago Med and Chicago Fire not also syndicated?
