Genre Action Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for violence and language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Daniel Stisen is able to bench press each of his co stars. User reviews56 Review Top review 1/10 Actor/Writer made this to show off his arms... ...and his inability to speak any coherent words. I swear he mumbled to the whole time. This movie is about as generic and cliched as you could possibly get. Actor/Director should stick to steroids and pumping his guns, because he has no talent for writing or acting or speaking or enunciating. helpful•13 5 DarlingLlama Oct 19, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 19, 2021 (United States) Countries of origin Sweden United Kingdom Language English Also known as 라스트 맨 다운 Production companies Daniel Stisen Productions Fansu Film See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 27 minutes Color Color Related news Last Man Down Clip: A Musclebound Action Film For The Pandemic Age [Exclusive] Oct 7Slash Film 10 Things You Didn’t Know about Olga Kent Sep 20TVovermind.com Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Spanish language plot outline for Last Man Down (2021)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
