To put it simply, this movie is a jewel: After being in love with it for quite the time, I have decided to settle down and write a review for it, because no matter how much praise it gets, this short animation film deserves more.All the people who did voices for the movie did very well. I was very impressed by how they got the mood just right and how you could just feel the emotion. The music and the animation are extremely well done. Another great part of this movie is the animation. People these days are getting so used to computer animation that when they see stop-motion, the first thing they think about are all the flaws in the movie. To me, that is the beauty of it. Everything you see is man-made by artists and craftsmen. It's awesome. All in all, this movie is a 8!! Go see this movie you won't regret it!!! helpful•216 24 bobash9830 Nov 16, 2016 Details Edit Release date September 8, 2016 (United Arab Emirates) Countries of origin United Arab Emirates United States Official sites Official Facebook Official Instagram Language English Also known as Bilal Filming locations Dubai, UAE Production companies Barajoun Entertainment Resnick Interactive Development See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $30,000,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $490,973 Opening weekend US & Canada $309,951 Feb 4, 2018 Gross worldwide $4,321,805 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 45 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 Related news Sky Greenlights ‘Call My Agent’ Italian Remake, Thriller Series ‘Europa’ From ‘Downfall’s’ Oliver Hirschbiegel (Exclusive) Oct 15Variety Film + TV Watch: Teaser of Mammootty’s ‘The Priest’ promises a gripping tale Feb 28The News Minute Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Bilal: A New Breed of Hero (2015) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
