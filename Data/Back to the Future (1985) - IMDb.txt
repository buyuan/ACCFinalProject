During his often hysterical, always amazing trip back in time, Marty must make certain his teenage parents-to-be meet and fall in love - so he can get back to the future. —Robert Lynch <docrlynch@yahoo.com> time traveltime machinedeloreanfuturetime travel comedy250 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines He's the only kid ever to get into trouble before he was born. [UK] Genres Adventure Comedy Sci-Fi Certificate (Banned) Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The rights to the film and its sequels are owned by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale. In a 2015 interview, Zemeckis maintained that no reboot or remake of the film would be authorized during his or Gale's lifetime. Goofs When Marty is being chased by terrorists, Eric Stoltz is playing Marty. Michael J. Fox was later chosen over him, but they kept the driving scenes at the mall with Stoltz in, since the shots were fairly distant and the driver's face is not particularly visible. Quotes Dr. Emmett Brown: [21:04] If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour... you're gonna see some serious shit. Crazy credits The character Marty McFly is credited as a performer on the song "Johnny B. Goode". It is actually sung by Mark Campbell with a guitar solo by Tim May. Alternate versions Spanish dubbed version also refers to Marty in 1955 as Levi Strauss instead of Calvin Klein.

Fox) is accidentally sent thirty years into the past in a time-traveling DeLorean invented by his friend, Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), and must make sure his high-school-age parents unite in order to save his own existence. After almost thirty years (2014), this film loses none of its charm, and actually gains respect. The movie has had such a strong impression on everyone, whether they have seen it or not, as it completely permeated pop culture. The script is genius, not only how it parallels 1955 and 1985 (some of the references are dynamite), but how it set the scene for the sequels (despite allegedly not intending to have any). This is just one clever gag after another, and may require repeated viewings to catch them all. helpful•28 5 gavin6942 Nov 19, 2014 FAQ42 When at Docs house in 1955 why does Marty say he's come from a long way away when in reality he only came from across town? When 1955 Doc is working with the DeLorean out on the street, in the background a person is seen riding a bike and wearing a brown jacket. This is the same type jacket 1985 Doc is wearing is the second movie when he's riding his bike around town. Is this intentional or coincidental? George McFly's novel "A Match Made In Space" shown at the end is his first novel. So how did he accumulate his wealth prior to that?
