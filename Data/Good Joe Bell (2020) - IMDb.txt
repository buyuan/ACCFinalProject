Goofs At approximately 1:11, as Joe is cresting a hill, an automobile passes on his left. The shot is reversed, which shows the driver on the right hand side. Joe's watch is on his right wrist, rather than his left. Quotes Joe Bell: A lot of people don't think it's a big deal to make fun of other people... um, who are different from you. You know, bullying and intolerance can have a deadly effect. And I'm here because I'm walking across America on behalf of my son, Jadin, to speak out against bullying.

No pun intended. Wahlberg's performance was overly acted and the movie was all over the place with a lot of continuity issues and time jumps. A lot of the grit that could have made it a great movie. Instead, it was glossed over. Would not recommend and that's a shame. helpful•5 6 scriabin17 Aug 21, 2021 Details Edit Release date July 23, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Official distributor site Official Facebook Language English Also known as Joe Bell Production companies Argent Pictures Closest to the Hole Productions Endeavor Content See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross US & Canada $1,405,488 Opening weekend US & Canada $749,635 Jul 25, 2021 Gross worldwide $1,744,894 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 34 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 2.76 : 1 Related news ‘King Richard’: How Director Reinaldo Marcus Green Impressed Will Smith and Scored a Dream Gig Nov 9Indiewire Jake Gyllenhaal Had Anxiety Freak-Out, Forgot Lines on ‘Spider-Man’ Set: ‘MCU Acting Is Hard’ Oct 8Indiewire Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Hindi language plot outline for Good Joe Bell (2020)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
