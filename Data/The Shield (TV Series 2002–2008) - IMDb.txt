More than 70 officers associated with CRASH were implicated in misconduct. Their crimes included unprovoked shootings, unprovoked beatings, planting of false evidence, stealing and dealing narcotics, bank robbery, perjury, and the covering up of evidence of these activities. There was also a connection with Death Row Records ( which was affiliated with the Bloods street gang), with several officers serving as off-duty security in exchange for extremely generous pay. It was alleged that a number of these officers were involved and perhaps responsible for the murder of rapper Notorious B.I.G It was determined that 90% of the members of CRASH were either directly involved in misconduct or were fully aware of it. Quotes Vic Mackey: Good cop and bad cop have left for the day. I'm a different kind of cop.

The Shield is absolutely deserving of its hype and still holds up as much today as it did when it was on over 12 years ago! There are sooo many good police shows out there to choose from but The Shield is among the best to ever do it. It will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire series! helpful•20 4 Supermanfan-13 Jul 28, 2020 FAQ30 What were the official working hours in the Farmington precinct ?
