Genres Animation Action Drama Fantasy Sci-Fi Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia A screenshot of an email death threat to Hideaki Anno from angry fans and a picture of the vandalized Gainax office building are among the random images played toward the end of the film. Quotes Shinji Ikari: I'm so fucked up. Crazy credits The credits are shown at the halfway point of the movie instead of at the end. Also, they rise in a helix pattern instead of rising straight up. Alternate versions Manga Entertainment's 2002 DVD release of the movie contains some noticeable changes from the original film. In the English dub for instance, "splat" sound effects were dubbed into the scene of Misato shooting a trooper in the head and the scene in which the mass-produced Evas explode. Additionally in the dub, a shot in which a trooper attacks a NERV member with a flamethrower now has the added line "Hit 'im again!". Finally, a set of translated credits set to the song "THANATOS ~ If I Can't Be Yours" is shown after the film's conclusion, but unlike the credits appearing halfway through the movie, these credits are shown in the standard "scrolling" fashion. (The original Japanese version of the film has no credits at the end.) These and other alterations are explained by Amanda Winn Lee, the writer, producer and director of the English version, in the DVD's commentary track. However, many fans of the series carry animosities toward Winn Lee for authorizing such changes, and the DVD was criticized for its poor picture quality and errors in the subtitle translation.

It takes the form of two episodes and serves as an alternate ending to the series. Everything about this piece amazed me, from the brilliant animation, to the subtle and deep storyline, to the feeling of dramatic climax the series was building up to in the first place. I have to say that Hideaki Anno managed to play my emotions like an instrument, and the effect is never lessened, no matter how many times I watch it. helpful•60 32 Manga_Man Sep 2, 2000 FAQ1 Do I have to watch the series first to understand this movie?
