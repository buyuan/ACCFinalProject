Connections Featured in WatchMojo: Top 20 Anime Everyone Needs To Watch (2021) User reviews163 Review Top review 9/10 You must watch this one! I found out about this anime from a random trailer on YouTube. I had absolutely no idea there was a manga on this subject. Oh, boy am I glad I decided to watch the trailer! After watching all 3 episodes, all I can say is IMPRESSIVE! From the opening sequence to the great cgi, graphics and world building to the believable environment, characters and story. And the historical aspects are treated with respect. The simple fact that there are no horned helmets makes me want to rate it 10/10! Somehow, it brings back memories from the very first season of Vikings. I am really intrigued by Vinland Saga and can't wait to find out more about this series. Maybe I'll even give the manga a go. It's a must watch! helpful•25 18 Alexlionfire Jul 13, 2019 Details Edit Release date July 7, 2019 (Japan) Country of origin Japan Official site Original Site Language Japanese Also known as 冰海战记 Production company Wit Studio See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 24 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news 10 Strongest Vinland Saga Characters, Ranked Jul 6ScreenRant.com 10 Reasons Vinland Saga Deserves A Second Season May 8ScreenRant.com Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What was the official certification given to Vinland Saga (2019) in Mexico?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
