Connections Features Megham (1999) Soundtracks Aalolam Written by Santhosh Varma Produced by Shaan Rahman Performed by K.S. Harishankar and Gowry Lekshmi User reviews78 Review Top review 5/10 Lacks any sense The movie is funny in parts but doesn't make sense at all. After all the heavy buildup and hype for Nayantara as some feminist and a strong-willed woman, she falls for Nivin who is an absolute knob in the movie. Dhyan does try to portray some positive dimensions of Nivins character, but it falls flat. After all the stunts that Nivin pulls not only with Nayantara but also her dad, no idea why anybody would accept to marry him (lol). A stupid movie overall, compounded by the fact that both Nivin and Nayan are such good actors. If it were some newbies the film would have been okay, but with this starcast, it's a crime to give them a half baked script with confusing characters. helpful•1 0 alphadude007 Dec 29, 2019 Details Edit Release date September 5, 2019 (India) Country of origin India Official sites Official Facebook Stream Love Action Drama officially on Hotstar Singapore Language Malayalam Also known as Любовь.
