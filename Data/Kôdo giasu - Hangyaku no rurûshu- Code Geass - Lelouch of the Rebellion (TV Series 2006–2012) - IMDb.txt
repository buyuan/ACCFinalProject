Japan is now referred to as Area 11, and its people the 11's. A Britannian who was living in Japan at the time, Lelouch, vowed to his Japanese friend Suzaku that he'd destroy Britannia. Years later, Lelouch is in high school, but regularly skips out of school to go play chess and gamble on himself. One day, he stumbles on terrorists 11's who've stolen a military secret and is caught by a member of the Britannian task force sent after them, who is Suzaku. As the rest of the squad arrives, Suzaku is shot for disobeying orders, while the military secret, a young immortal witch, gives Lelouch the power of Geass, which makes anyone obey any order. While Suzaku is secretly made the pilot of Britannia's brand new prototype Knightmare, Lancelot, Lelouch becomes the masked Zero to lead the rebellion to destroy Britannia once and for all. —Anonymous animekyoto japanprejudiceracismsupernatural power49 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Once friends, now enemies. Genres Animation Action Drama Sci-Fi Thriller Certificate (Banned) Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Geass (or Geas) is a term used in Irish Mythology that means 'contract' or 'vow'. Quotes Charles: The former 17th heir to the Imperial Throne, Lelouch vi Britannia. It's been a long time, hasn't it, my errant son? Lelouch: [struggles to lift his head] How dare you...! Suzaku: [forces Lelouch's head down] You won't use your Geass. [to Charles] Suzaku: Your Majesty, I have a request. Please, sire, allow me to join the Knights of the Round, the twelve strongest knights of the Britannian Empire. Charles: As a reward for capturing Zero, is that it? Lelouch: You... Suzaku: I told you before, Lelouch, that I was going to change this world from the inside. Lelouch: Even if it means selling out your friends? Suzaku: That's right. Charles: Very well. I like the answer you just gave him. Now then, as a Knight of the Round I order you: cover up Zero's left eye. Suzaku: Yes, Your Majesty. [covers Lelouch's left eye and lifts his head up by the hair] Charles: My unworthy son, who raised the banner of rebellion although he was a prince. Still, there's another way we can make use of him. Lelouch: [gasps] What? Charles: [Geass appears in both his eyes] I will rewrite your memory, about being Zero, about the death of your mother, about the very existence of Nunnally. Lelouch: No... Geass... Charles: You'll remember none of it. You'll just be insignificant. Lelouch: [struggling against Suzaku] No, stop! You're stealing what's most precious to me again! First my mother, and now you're taking Nunnally! Charles: Charles zi Britannia engraves into you... Lelouch: Stop it! Charles: False memories of a false life. Lelouch: [screams in anguish] Connections Edited into Kôdo Giasu: Hangyaku no Rurûshu I - Kôdô (2017) Soundtracks O2 First opening theme (episodes #1-12) Performed by ORANGE RANGE Lyrics and music by ORANGE RANGE User reviews178 Review Top review 10/10 The so far best of anime series Before this, Cowboy bebop has the most artistic take on directing anime series, it showcased how each individual 20 minute episode can have the same artistic direction of a feature movie. And now came Code Geass. Code Geass tells the story of murder and deception (like the starting point of any recent Korean historical soap opera), but influenced by many well-known anime titles like Death Note (Teenage genius obtain manipulative supernatural ability), Akira (beautiful friendship torn apart), a little Evangelion (psychotic kid and "HA-SHIN!!!"), Ghost in the Shell: SAC ( Cecile's uniform and hair style-color looks suspiciously like the Major's). By the first starting sequence you won't find anything so special that created the mass fan-boys out there, but at the end of the episode (cliffhanger) you'll be convinced that this is going to be serious. Code Geass deliver curiosity at the end of any episode and surprises at every episode, following a greatly constructed plot that is so daring, you might think it can crash and burn any time, not only that, it surpasses Cowboy Bebop in making each episode as artistic and moving like a Nolan MOVIE. Speaking of which, the political run of this anime is so fast paced, it reminded me of the first time I saw Nolan's "The Prestige" without subtitles, the sequences sometimes change in such untouched momentum that the viewing experience may get mind-numbing after a continuous five to six episode (it is either a bad side or a good side, your comment). The real stuff here is the issues of morality, the script and the whole idea was to showoff how the director can sustain countless amount of character relations and messages and not to kill someone quick, neither to drag an issue to tiresome lengths, nothing feels too cheesy to make the action sequence boring and the whole story lol-worthy. The animation is very clean or sometimes feel a little lack of detail, but it is made by the same production that gave us ALL of the Gundam series, Cowboy Bebop and Witch Hunter Robin, so never will you see any scene run short in frame rate. The characters are designed by CLAMP so you'll see big eyes, pretty girls and ridiculously tall schoolboys, but the production takes the thing serious and remove the cliché sweat drops and chibi faces, and add seriousness to the expressions, be it happy or sad, or even downright insane. This anime have mechas (he he he), and the fight sequences are fast and waste no precious time, even though the creators have made them more realistic (mechas runs on visible battery packs now, and they don't run like Gundams, they have legs for tilting and balancing or sometimes kicking in ways of the spectacular, leaving ground contact maneuverability for custom wheels, and they look cool nonetheless). The music, in short, makes the episode cool like Bebop but I faintly remember that it is not Yoko Kanno's. In all, I won't spoil anything, and I won't hype it up either, I'll let the experience alone impress you, but from my appreciation: ALL HAIL CODE GEASS !!! helpful•88 27 Facehugger_28 Dec 15, 2008 FAQ1 Is there any progress on "Code Geass Movie Project?
