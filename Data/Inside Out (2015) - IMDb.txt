Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions - Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness. The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley's mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley's main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school. —Pixar joysadnessangermemoryrunning away151 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Meet the little voices inside your head. Genres Animation Adventure Comedy Drama Family Fantasy Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG for mild thematic elements and some action Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia According to director Pete Docter, each emotion is based on a shape: Joy is based on a star, Sadness is a teardrop, Anger is a fire brick, Fear is a raw nerve, and Disgust is broccoli. He noted that he likes broccoli very much, however. Goofs When Riley runs away from home she leaves in the morning and begins walking to the bus stop. When her parents arrive home that night to find her missing she is still walking to the bus stop, approximately 6 hours later. Quotes [Joy looks down into the memory dump and sees Bing Bong jumping for joy] Bing Bong: You made it! Go! Go save Riley! [Joy watches Bing Bong start to fade away] Bing Bong: Take her to the moon for me. Okay? Crazy credits Dedicated to our children. Don't grow up. Ever. Alternate versions Riley hating broccoli was changed to peppers in the Japanese version.

I watched the movie long time ago, and I've just rewatched it today. For kids it will be a funny movie with no meaning maybe!! But for an adult, its so true!! You lose your childhood personality you change you feel sad, i mean it literally touches my soul Great movie for both kids and adults. helpful•127 85 gloriesalbuainain Jun 14, 2019 FAQ6 How can Riley have blue eyes while both her parents are brown-eyed? Why only five emotions? Where are Surprise, Shame, etc. ? Why couldn't Joy just send Riley's (most important) core memories back to the headquarters using that "Memory Wall" that could send in other core memories?
