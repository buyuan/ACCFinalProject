Only one person can stop him: The woman who loves him ! Genres Romance Thriller War Certificate R Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia A cottage and lighthouse were constructed on the The Isle of Mull for the production of this movie. The set building utilized the skills of a seventy-two year old master thatcher, a local of the island. Goofs Other then in Burma, and a bit of Coast Guard work, Helicopters were not around in Military use (or few others for that matter) in 1944. That model was not flown by the RAF until 1953. Quotes Faber: [calling on radio to submarine] Singvogel. Hier ist die Nadel. Kommen. ["Songbird. This is the Needle. Come."] Alternate versions NTSC DVD R1 and PAL DVD R2, have different endings. European PAL DVD version ending is approx. 1.5 minutes longer. In the last scene, the helicopter arrives and lands, there is a conversation with the commander about the radio transmission being interrupted and finally the child arrives and reunites with his mother. it's sort of a happy end. This ending was cut from NTSC DVD version. Connections Referenced in The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson: Donald Sutherland/Martin Mull (1983) Soundtracks For He's a Jolly Good Fellow (uncredited) Traditional Sung by wedding guests with modified lyrics ("For They Are Jolly Good Fellows") User reviews73 Review Top review Tight, kinetic suspenser Donald Sutherland is superb as "The Needle", a Nazi spy pursued by the British government during World War II. Circumstances land him on Storm Island, a small, wind-swept patch of land off the English coast. There he falls in love with the sensual Kate Nelligan, the unhappy, lonely wife of a crippled war vet. The late Richard Marquand's second feature film is a gripping, suspenseful wartime drama about doomed love. The blazing glow of this film is enhanced by sizzling yet subtle scenes of lovemaking and a stunning Miklos Rosza score. The island vistas are breathtaking and Alan Hulme's pictures are rich and moody. helpful•39 7 fertilecelluloid Jan 1, 2005 Details Edit Release date December 17, 1981 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Official site MGM Languages English German Also known as The Eye of the Needle Filming locations Mull, Argyll and Bute, Scotland, UK Production company Kings Road Entertainment See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross US & Canada $17,583,634 Gross worldwide $17,583,634 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 52 minutes Sound mix Mono Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Hulu New Releases: November 2021 Nov 1Den of Geek Star Trek Voyager: 10 great guest performances Nov 29Den of Geek Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Eye of the Needle (1981) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
