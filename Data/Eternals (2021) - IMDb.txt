Genres Action Adventure Fantasy Sci-Fi Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for fantasy violence and action, some language and brief sexuality. Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Gemma Chan didn't expect to return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe after appearing in Captain Marvel (2019) until Kevin Feige approached her while promoting Crazy Rich Asians (2018) to play a new character in some further production, which ended up being Sersi in the film. Goofs When Thena follows the deviant into the cave, the camera first shows Angelina Jolie holding a spear and a blade, the scene cuts to another angle where Thena is seen with a spear on one hand and the other hand has no blade visible. Quotes Sprite: If this is what the end of the world looks like, at least we'll have front-row seats... Phastos: You know what has never saved the world? Your sarcasm. Crazy credits SPOILER: There is a scene at the end of the closing credits: Dane Whitman opens a box containing the Ebony Blade, the weapon wielded by the Black Knight superhero. He attempts to touch it but the vampire hunter Blade halts him. Alternate versions The IMAX formats show the film in 1.90:1 aspect ratio, and shows more explicit nudity in the sex scene than regular widescreen versions.

This is a solid MCU movie! I don't get all the negative reviews. I went into this with low expectations because of what I'd read from critics but I was pleasantly surprised. The cast did a great job and I found each of the characters to be very likeable especially Kumail Nanjiaji who I thought was the best part of the movie. Go into this one with an open mind and you won't be disappointed it's a solid Marvel movie! helpful•72 51 joesallen-28850 Nov 7, 2021 FAQ2 Has Marvel Studios made any plans for a 'Moon Knight' film? Will it be based on primarily the original Jack Kirby comics or the Neil Gaiman comics from the 90s?
