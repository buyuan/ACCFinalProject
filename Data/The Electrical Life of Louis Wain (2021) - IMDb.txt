Goofs When Mr. Wain first arrives in New York, as he walks along a city street. The year shown on the screen is 1907. As he walks down the street, he is passed by several horse drawn carriage and then an automobile of early 1900 vintage. Next, another in car passes which is from the post 1915-1925 era, later than the timeframe depicted. Quotes Louis Wain: You make the world beautiful and warm and kind. I just wanted to say thank you for that before it's too late. Emily Richardson-Wain: I don't make the world beautiful, Louis. The world is beautiful, and you've helped me to see that, too. Just remember - however hard things get, however much you feel like you're struggling, the world is full of beauty. And it's up to you to capture it, Louis. To look and to share it with as many people as you can. You are a prism through which that beam of life refracts. Connections Referenced in Vecherniy Urgant: Benedict Cumberbatch/Nikolay Baskov (2021) User reviews48 Review Top review Mediocre performances, and just way too sentimental and saccharine OK, cat videos on YouTube are the most viewed category. I can just imagine the pitch for this film as slam dunk. But I have to say this was really so overwhelmingly cliché, saccharine and sentimental that I could not enjoy it. I really do not think this ranks a good performance by Cumberbach, who in other vehicles, has proven himself to be a truly great actor. 4/10 with most of the good marks for art direction. helpful•37 40 random-70778 Oct 5, 2021 Details Edit Release date January 1, 2022 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Language English Also known as Louis Wain Production companies Amazon Studios Film 4 Shoebox Films See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross worldwide $246,366 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 51 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 1.33 : 1 Related news Deadline’s Contenders Film: Los Angeles Streaming Site Is Live Nov 16Deadline Film + TV Jane Campion And Benedict Cumberbatch Channeled Paul Newman For ‘The Power Of The Dog’ – Contenders L.A.
