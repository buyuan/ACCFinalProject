Personal Quote: [in 2017, on Intent to Destroy (2017)] There's no question about the Armenian Genocide happening. It is not even up for debate. It is just the truth. Period. And there's nothing else to talk about . . . the documentary itself is just an opportunity for people to observe why it's been this controversial. See more » Trivia: Daughter of Grigor Sarafyan.
