Soon enough, she finds herself exactly where she had hoped to be, living happily with her husband and two children in the Upper West Side. A woman of her time, Midge is a cheerleader wife to a man who dreams of a stand-up comedy career, but her perfect life is upended when her husband suddenly leaves her for another woman. Utterly unprepared, Midge is left with no choice but to reevaluate her life. When she accidentally stumbles onto the stage at a nightclub, she discovers her own comedic skills and decides to use this newfound talent to help her reinvent her life. The series follows the trajectory of Midge's journey as she pursues a career in the male-dominated, stand-up comedy profession, and transforms from uptown society matron to East Village club performer. —kolnoaMograbi female protagonistnew york cityjewish familystand up comedian1950s17 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Genres Comedy Drama Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Amy Sherman-Palladino explained the show concept as follows: "I wanted to do a story about a woman who thought she'd scored...She'd gotten it all, and then, bam, it all falls apart. And in falling apart, she discovers an ambition and a need to speak, and a voice that she just frankly didn't know was there." Goofs Don Rickles is mentioned along with Bob Newhart. Rickles was years away from being famous in 1958, when the show takes place. Rickles and Newhart met in the mid 1960's.

Amazon is doing it right providing pilots and letting the actual consumers vote on what they want to watch. This is the latest of a string of good entertainment that should see a full season. The writing is smart and fast paced, the acting is top notch and it runs just edgy enough to keep you stunned without devolving into a parody. Give it a watch and vote for it on Amazon. This is TV that needs made. helpful•104 49 supergeniuswil Mar 22, 2017 FAQ4 Are all of the songs that Shy sings from the period? Any new material?
