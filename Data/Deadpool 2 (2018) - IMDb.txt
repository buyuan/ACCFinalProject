Genres Action Adventure Comedy Sci-Fi Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for strong violence and language throughout, sexual references and brief drug material Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia (at around 23 mins) The footage of the X-Men closing the door was shot on the set of Dark Phoenix (2019) and sent over to the Deadpool 2 crew. Goofs (at around 1h 8 mins) When the brakes on the prison rig are cut they leak hydraulic fluid making it unable to stop. A vehicle of that size and weight would definitely require air brakes which not only don't leak fluid but apply automatically if the fluid line is cut. Quotes Cable: I use a device to slide through time. The longer I travel, the harder it is to control. I got two charges: one to get me here, one to get me home. Wade Wilson: [looks at the camera] Well... that's just lazy writing. Crazy credits Juggernaut is credited as Himself. Alternate versions In India, the CBFC (Central Board Of Film Certification) demanded that audio edits be made to the film before the film could receive an 'A' rating (meaning that only an adult audience; whom are aged aged 18 and over can attend screenings of the film). These changes bleeped out some heavier profanities from the film; the violence and sexual humor however was left uncut.

By arrangement with Sony Music Entertainment User reviews1.3K Review Top review 8/10 I'll give it 7.5 but it's def not a 10 I thought the first one was decent but way too over-hyped. I like Ryan Reynolds acting he's pretty funny. But there wasn't such a great plot in the first one. And frankly it's was over vulgar for me. I saw the super duper cut so maybe its a bit different from the theatrical. In general I liked this one better then first one. It has decent plot and the other characters are fun too. Josh Brolin is great as always. helpful•11 1 alexleizerovichcoaching Jul 24, 2021 FAQ6 Will the PG-13 version ('Once Upon A Deadpool') be released on regular DVD, or only blu-ray? If you had the superpower of being lucky all the time, wouldn't that mean you're practically invincible? What are the differences between this version and 'Once Upon a Deadpool'?
