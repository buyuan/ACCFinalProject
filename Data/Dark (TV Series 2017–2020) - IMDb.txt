This place is a former military testing area of the German Democratic Republic. Goofs The police car used by Egon in 1953 is actually a model from a much later year as evidenced by the large rear window. A 1953 beetle had a small oval window in the back.

Best show I've ever watched. Every aspect of it looks spectacular. It's new , different, unique, confusing at times, thrilling, suspenseful, gripping, beautifully well acted, bit of romantic at the same time. Completely changed the Idea of time travel into my head. I don't think any other time travel thing will excite me more than DARK from now on. helpful•266 30 gauravs-01296 Jun 30, 2020 FAQ4 Is this series available in English dub?
