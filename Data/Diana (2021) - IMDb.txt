It does have some cringy lines and weak dialogue but its overall a more than decent musical. Theres no song in partiuclar that drove me crazy but the choreography, script and production are good. It is an almost sung-through musical, so keep that in mind in case you expected some scattered songs throught. Regarding veracity, i have no idea tbh. I couldnt care less about the royal family of the UK so it might have not been 100% historically accurate and i probably woulndt have noticed. For my basic knowledge, it covered it all but i couldnt testify to it being perfect in that area. Overall an entertaining musical that doesnt particularly bring anything new to the table but its more than an acceptable addition. If you are not a fan of musicals, this wont be the one that makes you like them, so maybe just skip it. If you usually enjoy musicals, give it a chance!! helpful•6 3 titimaida Oct 7, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 1, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Official Netflix Official Website of the Musical Language English Also known as Diana: A True Musical Story Filming locations Longacre Theatre - 220 W 48th St, New York City, New York, USA Production companies The Kennedy/Marshall Company Seeker Productions Apache Digital See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 57 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 2.00 : 1 Related news ‘Diana: The Musical’ Review: A Shallow Pop Tribute to a Complicated Icon Oct 4Variety Film + TV The wait was worth it: ‘Six’ opens on Broadway to ‘fantastic’ reviews and is early Tony Awards favorite Oct 4Gold Derby Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What was the official certification given to Diana (2021) in the United Kingdom?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
