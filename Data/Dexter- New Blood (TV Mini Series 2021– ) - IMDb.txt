Jeff Lindsay wrote the original novels that inspired the television series. Connections Follows Dexter (2006) User reviews163 Review Top review 10/10 Big Fan of Dexter so excited for this! I love how the writers tapped into the nostalgia of the original series. The build up of what triggers Dexter's dark passenger was very well done, and having Deb be his new conscious was a perfect way to bring back that dynamic that made the original so great and really gave the viewers what we want and have been missing for so long. Also love the new characters. The way they tie the into his life is very much how they original characters did. Especially everyone at the police station. Again genius writing. And putting Dex in a relationship with a cop so he can stay connected to that life, was perfect! I can't wait to see what else this season brings. Side note: I was so excited for this show I had to call and add/pay more to have showtime added to my cable package. Totally worth it! helpful•16 6 waz_ee Nov 12, 2021 Details Edit Release date November 7, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site SHOWTIME Language English Also known as ديكستر: نيو بلوود Filming locations Middlesex, Massachusetts, USA Production company Showtime Networks See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news SAG Awards predictions for TV Drama Ensemble: ‘Succession’ far out front, but what about ‘Squid Game’?
