Minoria's signature caustic humor is nowhere to be found, and instead we get unfunny jokes, absurd debates and visitors from La Fábrica's true flagship show, 'Sálvame', which actually runs opposite this one and is (rightfully, if we look at the ratings) treated as a far bigger deal by Cuatro's parent group Mediaset. In the 'unfunny jokes' department, Itziar Catro's comments about her own overweight are the most glaring case in point. It's perfectly fine to be able to laugh at oneself, but she's abusing the resource. Miguel Lago's output has peaks and valleys, convincing when he pulls off his upper-class snob gimmick, but absolutely lost in the aforementioned debates with Castelo. And host Risto, no matter how hard he tries, simply isn't believable as the vitriolic juror we met at 'Operación Triunfo' anymore, which is good for his other show, 'Chester', but here contributes to most of the show's satire falling flat on its face. helpful•1 0 efragarcia59 Jan 14, 2019 Details Edit Release date January 8, 2019 (Spain) Country of origin Spain Official site Cuatro (Spain) Language Spanish Production companies La Fabrica de la tele Minoria Absoluta See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Color Color Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
