After peaceful floating in zero-gravity, astronaut Barbarella lands on the frozen planet Lythion and sets out to find renowned scientist Durand Durand in the City of Night, Sogo, where a new sin is invented every hour. There, she encounters such objects as the Excessive Machine, a genuine sex organ on which an expert artist of the keyboard, in this case, Durand Durand himself, can drive a victim to death by pleasure, a lesbian queen who can make her fantasies take form in her Chamber of Dreams, and a group of ladies smoking a giant hookah which dispenses Essence of Man through a poor victim struggling in its glass globe. You can not help but be impressed by the special effects crew and the various ways that were found to tear off what minimal clothes our heroine seemed to possess. —alfiehitchie angelspace operasexy suitqueenfuture255 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Who gives up the pill?

Genres Adventure Comedy Fantasy Sci-Fi Certificate Approved Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The scenes during the opening credits where Barbarella seems to float around her spaceship were filmed by having Jane Fonda lie on a huge piece of Plexiglas with a picture of the spaceship underneath her. It was filmed from above, creating the illusion that she is in zero gravity. Goofs In the beginning, Barbarella is in zero gravity, yet her hair falls down toward the ground. Quotes Barbarella: What's that screaming? A good many dramatic situations begin with screaming... Crazy credits In the opening credits, the letters in the words move around in an attempt to obscure Barbarella's nudity. Alternate versions Barbarella was released in the USA before the MPAA introduced the motion picture rating system on November 1, 1968. It was consequently released with a tag "Suggested For Mature Audiences". A re-release in 1977 (to cash in on the success of Star Wars (1977)) was edited to obtain a "PG" rating and was called "Barbarella: Queen Of The Galaxy". The video version is of the original uncut version and not the "PG" version (despite the subtitle "Queen of the Galaxy" and the "PG" rating on the cover). Connections Featured in Henry Fonda: The Man and His Movies (1982) Soundtracks Barbarella Written by Bob Crewe & Charles Fox Performed by The Glitterhouse User reviews232 Review Top review 6/10 Niche Very much a film of its age, this film is relentless, unmitigable shite from beginning to end, and yet it is a delight to watch. It will particularly appeal to anyone who thought the special effects in the original Flash Gordon TV series were over the top. The plot-holes are gargantuan, the continuity errors are abysmal, most of the story is absolute nonsense and yet this film is an absolute pleasure to watch. The fantastic excuses used to divest Jane Fonda of various pieces of her costume will have you choking into your popcorn. The seventies' view of a future of decadence is a breath of fresh air and the idea of absolute, insane evil is camped up to the max. You'll either love it, loathe it, or do both simultaneously. helpful•8 1 Fles Feb 24, 2008 FAQ1 Was Barbarella a virgin before meeting the Fur Trapper?
