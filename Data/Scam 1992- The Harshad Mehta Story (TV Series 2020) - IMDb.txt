This is the only Indian web series I found which doesn't use overly melodramatic scenes. Usually Indian TV series in general stretch the story to the point it almost gets frustrating. But not this one. Do your self a favor and watch it now! helpful•207 28 pratikshah-65174 Oct 22, 2020 FAQ1 Any plans to translate the series into English?
