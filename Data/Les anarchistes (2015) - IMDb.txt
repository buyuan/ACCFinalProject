Political change is rampant throughout Europe and new ideas are being propagated as an alternative to the many broken societies and the vast gulf between the haves and have nots. The anarchists were and indeed are such a 'group' if that is indeed the right noun of assemblage. Tahir Rahman ('A Prophet' and 'The Cut') plays Jean Albertini; an educated policeman who gets chosen to go undercover and expose the dark underbelly of the anarchists in Paris. He takes to his new role like a duck to water. Amongst his new comrades are Judith Lorillard played by the sultry Adèle Exarchopoulos ('Blue is the warmest colour') and a very aggressive Guillaume Gouix playing Eugène Levèque an alpha male who wants to take the struggle to the next level – confrontation. Now this plays out in a linear format and as well as the politics, personal strife's and some very well acted scenes this should be a rollicking good adventure. However, it just lacks oomph and moments of high drama seem to almost fizzle out before they get under way. This could be down to the direction from Elie Wajeman who brought us 'Aliyah' which was a fairly good, but unreported, film. It is not down to the acting and the script looked pretty much spot on. That said this is still a reasonable watch but more above average rather than the blast it could and possibly should have been given the talent on display here. helpful•4 6 t-dooley-69-386916 Apr 1, 2016 Details Edit Release date November 11, 2015 (France) Country of origin France Language French Also known as The Anarchists Filming locations Paris, France Production companies 24 Mai Productions France 2 Cinéma Mars Films See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross worldwide $204,270 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 41 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 Related news Cameras are rolling on Elie Wajeman’s Un médecin de nuit - Production / Funding - France Dec 12Cineuropa - The Best of European Cinema Jeff Daniels Joins Tahar Rahim In The Looming Tower Drama Series Mar 14We Got This Covered Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Les anarchistes (2015) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
