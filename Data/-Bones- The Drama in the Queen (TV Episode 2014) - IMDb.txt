When possible suspects tell Brennan and Sweets that Brian may have been having an affair, the team digs a little deeper only to find details of Brian's secret life. Meanwhile, Sweets fills in for Booth in the investigation while Booth prepares to testify before a Congressional sub-committee and the Jeffersonian team gets a new intern who catches Sweets' attention. —Ester Castro hare krishnadumping a dead bodyswimmingredheaded womannickname31 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Genres Comedy Crime Drama Mystery Romance Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Goofs When Angela displays the Wi-Fi account information, the IP address of Madam's Apple router is not possible. Interestingly, instead of the way most productions show fake IP's which is to make one or more of the four sets of three (any single or double digit number has an undisplayed 0 in their place, e.g. 4 is really 004) numbers 256 or higher (255 is the highest possible) but what they did here was to show 5 sets of three which is also invalid. Quotes Jessica Warren: Luck is the unknown mixed with knowledge, instinct, commitment, imagination, and foresight.
