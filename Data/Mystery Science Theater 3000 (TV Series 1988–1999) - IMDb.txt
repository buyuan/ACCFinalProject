While in space Joel builds wacky robot sidekicks Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot to help him withstand an onslaught of grade 'Z' movies that the mad scientists force him to watch. —Jeremy Lunt <durlinlunt@acadia.net> cringe comedynear futurehorror hostmale horror hostgrindhouse filmmaking22 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines We've got movie sign! Genres Comedy Sci-Fi Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The show gained popularity after fans taped episodes and gave them to their friends. In seasons 2-4, a line at the end of the end credits says "Keep circulating the tapes." That ended after Best Brain's lawyers questioned the show's support of piracy. Goofs A line in the end credits thanks "The authors of the First Ammendment." The last word should be spelled "Amendment." Quotes Tom Servo: What do you think the lesson of the movie was? Crow: Don't watch it. Crazy credits In some episodes Torgo's theme from 'manos' the hands of fate plays in the background of the credits Alternate versions For syndication, the show was aired as "The Mystery Science Theater Hour." Eleven episodes from seasons 2-4 were broken up into two-parters, and released as 22 hour-long episodes into what was effectively first-run syndication for the 1995-96 season. Although the original host segments were retained, new introductions were also filmed featuring Michael J. Nelson as the balding "Host" (a parody of A&E announcer Jack Perkins). Connections Edited from Hamlet, Prinz von Dänemark (1960) Soundtracks The Love Theme from Mystery Science Theatre 3000 Lyrics by Joel Hodgson and J. Elvis Weinstein Music by Charlie Erickson and Joel Hodgson Performed by Joel and the Joels User reviews231 Review Top review 10/10 Excellent! Ranks right up there with "The Simpsons" and "The Daily Show" ! For those unfortunate few who have never seen an episode of Joel Hodgson's MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 (referred to by fans as 'MST3K'), here is a brief rundown on all the fun you've missed out on. Dr. Forrester is your typical mad scientist. He sports big glasses, an oversized lab coat, crazy hair, and an insatiable urge to take over the world. In an effort to kick off his latest foolproof world-domination scheme, Dr. Forrester abducts a dry-witted janitor named Joel Robinson from the research center they both work at. Joel is blasted into space in an apparently escape-proof ship called the Satellite of Love, forever doomed to orbit the planet Earth. Forrester keeps contact with Joel via satellite transmission, and each week sends hims an unbearably awful b-movie which he is forced to watch. The mad doctor's idea is to keep sending movies that are so mind-numbingly terrible that it will eventually drive Joel and his viewers to insanity, thus giving him an easy outlet for conquering the world. To help preserve his sanity, Joel uses parts from the ship to build four wise-cracking robot friends that keep him company and help us to avoid cinema-induced lunacy by mercilessly heckling the films. The show aired weekly, and re-introduced old 1950s-70s era drive-in swill to a world that has long forgotten about it. The movies they chose--The Brain That Wouldn't Die, Time of the Apes, and (most notorious) Manos: The Hands of Fate, for example--were truly some of the most awful abominations in cinema history, and how they were able to find clear, working prints of these (mostly) obscure films is beyond me. Not only was it great to be able to witness some of these "masterpieces" first-hand, but the non-stop commentary by Joel, Tom, and Crow was absolutely hysterical. There was never a dull moment when those boys hit the SOL's onboard movie theater. On occasion, there would be a break from the movie to show a humorous sketch that would further the basic plot of the show. While many of these segments were admittedly not all that funny, they didn't last long, and Forrester would call for "MOVIE SIGN!" again in no time. Come to think of it, it may not even be that these primitive skits weren't funny, but that they simply paled in comparison to the sheer hilarity that took place in the ship's movie theater. MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 is one of the few television programs that seems to be loved by virtually everybody. Seriously--I know of not a single person who didn't like this show, nor have I ever read a single negative comment or review of it. That being said, why on Earth was such a brilliant show like MST3K canceled? It couldn't have been because of poor ratings, since the show had a huge cult following and a substantial amount of regular viewers. If anyone has any information regarding why this series was taken off the air, please contact me! helpful•100 18 Cowman Jul 19, 2003 FAQ5 I always read there were ten seasons; why does IMDb list eleven? Why did Joel leave the show? Why is Crow's head backwards when watching the movies?
