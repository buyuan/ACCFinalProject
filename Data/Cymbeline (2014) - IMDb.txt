Connections Version of Cymbeline (1937) Soundtracks I'm Indestructible written and performed by Andrew Adkins Courtesy of Whiskey Begonias (ASCAP) User reviews37 Review Top review 3/10 Misleading IMDB description "A gritty story of a take-no-prisoners war between dirty cops and an outlaw biker gang. A drug kingpin is driven to desperate measures." That's the IMDB description. What it leaves out, most deceptively, is that the entire dialogue is in Shakespearean verse. That's not a minor blemish. Tis' grievous in omission, and a foul disservice to both eye and ear. Otherwise, it's a pretty, color-saturated film with more popular and respected actors than can almost be counted, but it feels flat and lifeless and so very, very poser in its essential affectations. helpful•5 3 movieswithgreg Dec 11, 2019 Details Edit Release date March 13, 2015 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Official Site Official site (Japan) Language English Also known as Anarchy Filming locations Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA Production companies Benaroya Pictures Keep Your Head See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross worldwide $64,851 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 38 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news HBO Max New Releases: November 2021 Nov 1Den of Geek New on HBO Max in November 2021 Oct 25Gold Derby Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the English language plot outline for Cymbeline (2014)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
