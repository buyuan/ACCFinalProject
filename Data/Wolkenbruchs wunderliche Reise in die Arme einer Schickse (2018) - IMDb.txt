Fellow student Laura, however, does not, at all - but unfortunately she is a schikse. She wears pants, has a nice tuches, drinks gin and tonic, and swears. Motti begins to have doubts about the predetermined path given by his parents as the road for him to follow? His obedience towards his mother's disturbing methods starts to fade as his passion for Laura grows. Things take their course, and very soon Motti comes to a conclusion: even schiksen can be totally nuts. —Thomas Meyer bare chested maleleekjewish familygrocery storemother son relationship47 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Comedy Drama Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Official submission of Switzerland for the 'Best International Feature Film' category of the 92nd Academy Awards in 2020. Quotes Motti: There's a very clear scheme of life for Jewish men: we are born, get circumcised on the eighth day, have our Bar Mitzvah at the age of thirteen, and later we marry a Jewish woman who is as pious as we are. And then it's time to make babies, one after another. And in between, we work and pray, become grandfathers and great-grandfathers until, one day, we die, and the soul becomes bound up in the eternal bundle of life. So it is written. Everything nicely laid out, whether you like it or not.

I adored this movie! It reminded me of a Woody Allen production, combining humour (Yiddish) and pathos in a funny yet heartfelt manner. I was thoroughly entertained! Joel Basman's performance as "Motti" is A+...definitely Oscar worthy. helpful•8 5 Nikkie1 Nov 27, 2019 Details Edit Release date October 25, 2019 (Australia) Country of origin Switzerland Official site Official site Languages German Yiddish Hebrew Also known as The Awakening of Motti Wolkenbruch Filming locations Tel Aviv, Israel Production companies DCM Pictures DCM Productions Schweizer Fernsehen (SF) See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 34 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news ‘And Tomorrow We Will Be Dead’ Director Michael Steiner on Portraying the Taliban, the Hostage Mindset and His First TV Series (Exclusive) Sep 21Variety Film + TV Zurich Film Festival Shakes Up Theatrical Experience With James Bond Sep 21Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Wolkenbruchs wunderliche Reise in die Arme einer Schickse (2018) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
