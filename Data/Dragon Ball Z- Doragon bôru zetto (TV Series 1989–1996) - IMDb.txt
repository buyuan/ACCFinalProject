Genres Animation Action Adventure Comedy Drama Fantasy Sci-Fi Thriller Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia In the show, the evil, often comically fat monster Majin Bû was created by a sorcerer named Bibidi and brought out of hibernation by the actions of Bibidi's son, the sorcerer Babidi. This is an homage to Cinderella (1950) in which Cinderella's fairy godmother turns a pumpkin into a coach with the magical spell "Bibbity Bobbity Boo!" (Bibidi-Babidi-Bû) Goofs In the Raditz fight, Piccolo has red blood. In all subsequent fights, he has purple blood. Quotes [to an android] Vegeta: If you give up now I promise to turn you into something useful, like a toaster or a washing machine. Alternate versions The FUNimation dub censors all profanity from the dialogue, even in the uncut version.

Probably the greatest animated series of alltime.The drawings are simply superb, the characters and the whole story is so complex and thrilling you simply can't miss it. It's great the way they involve humor features in an epic story. 9,9/10 helpful•17 8 max-61 Jan 16, 1999 FAQ33 Why is there two entries for Dragon Ball Z series? Why there's English Cast listed here, if this is the Japanese title page then? I don't understand. Why didn't Trunks or Goten aren't shown with a tail?
