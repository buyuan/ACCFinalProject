The pair tied the knot in 1991, but divorced in 2001. Goofs When Roy is shot in the heart at the end of the film, a small circle of blood forms around the bullet hole in his shirt. Later, when the body is shown again, the blood stain hasn't expanded in size. A real shot to the heart would have caused massive bleeding in a very short time, resulting in a greatly enlarged blood stain. Quotes Kay: You got a pretty face, you should let the boys see it. Ginnie: It ain't my face the boys want to see.

Series Written by Nelson Riddle, William Loose, Jack Cookerly, Emil Cadkin User reviews46 Review Top review Why I Liked This Movie A friend gave me this tape a few weeks ago, it did not have a cover and I had never heard of it. I was surprised to see who starred in it. Meg Ryan is one of my favorite actresses. She did a real good job of making this part come alive. But I still think the biggest surprise was seeing James Caan play a role without any feeling. He really was evil in this role and was believable as this person. The movie itself really makes you think that whatever you do will eventually come back to haunt you no matter what you do. I also liked Gwyneth Paltrow in the role of a thief, but I wished that I knew why she did the things that she did. And why she would stay with a man that was pure evil. I guess that is what makes the movie so thought provoking. I'm glad that a friend gave this to me to watch, because if I had seen the title I would have thought it was a horror movie. I have since talked other friends into watching it and all have liked it. I would recommend this movie to anyone. helpful•11 5 grace65746 Jul 26, 2004 Details Edit Release date November 5, 1993 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Et ve Kemik Filming locations Monahans, Texas, USA Production companies Mirage Enterprises Spring Creek Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross US & Canada $9,709,451 Opening weekend US & Canada $4,517,066 Nov 7, 1993 Gross worldwide $9,709,451 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 2 hours 6 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby DTS Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Gwyneth Paltrow's Head Was in a Box for Halloween Like in Se7en Oct 30MovieWeb Watch Starz’s ‘Flesh and Bone’ Premiere Episode Online for Free Nov 3Slash Film Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Flesh and Bone (1993) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
