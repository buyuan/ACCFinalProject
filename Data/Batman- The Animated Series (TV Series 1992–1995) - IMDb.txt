Throughout the show, Batman receives help from sidekicks Dick Grayson/Robin (Loren Lester) and Barbara Gordon/Batgirl (Melissa Gilbert), as well as Police Commissioner James Gordon (Bob Hastings), in protecting the streets of Gotham City from a large rogue's gallery of criminals, lunatics, and nemeses. —Spiricom dc comicsshared universebatman characterdc animated universebased on comic book61 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines The Legend Begins Genres Animation Action Adventure Crime Family Mystery Sci-Fi Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Kevin Conroy is the first person in animation to use two distinct voices to portray Bruce Wayne and Batman. It was his own idea. Quotes The Joker: [after Batman fights back against his hyenas] Hey! Do I hit your kids? Oh, actually I do... Crazy credits Despite being invariably referred to as "Batman--The Animated Series" (until the changes in title, tone, and additional screen time for Robin for the second season), the series had NO on-screen title. Connections Edited into Necessary Evil: Super-Villains of DC Comics (2013) Soundtracks Batman The Animated Series Written by Danny Elfman and Shirley Walker User reviews178 Review Top review The real Batman This program thanks to people like Alan Burnett, Paul Dini, and Bruce W. Timm made this show the most faithful adaption of the Dark Knight ever. This show was brilliant!!!! It had terrific animation, story line, character development, and action sequences. Regardless of weather you're a Batman fan or not this is a show not to be missed. helpful•82 6 TheMan3051 Jun 28, 2002 FAQ10 Who created the character of Batman? Bob Kane is listed in old (pre-2015) media including the comic books as creating Batman on his own but new media (made after 2015) shows him as co-creating the character with someone called Bill Finger, so what's all that about? Which villain characters were adapted from the Batman comic books? Which hero characters were adapted from the Batman comic books?
