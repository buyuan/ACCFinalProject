Chased away from her village because of her mysterious pregnancy, Mara finds herself employed at the Tekir Hotel, providing treatment for infertile women using this miraculous mud. As she meets the rich and eccentric Mrs. Lili, Mara questions her beliefs and intuitions. The relationship between the two women is the key of the miracle of Tekir, between magic and power, tradition and modernity. —AnonymousB f rated Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Drama Mystery Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia Won the 'Best Feature Film' Award at the 1st 'Imagine This Women's International Film Festival' in 2016.
