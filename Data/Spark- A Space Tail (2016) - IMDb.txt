Now splintered into hundreds of shards, Zhong is Bana's evil-overlord, ruling with an iron fist. Enter Spark, a teenage monkey and his friends, Vix, a battle-ready fox, and Chunk, a tech-savvy pig. Spark learns of Zhong's secret plan to take over the universe by capturing a giant space monster known as the Kraken, a beast that has the power to create black holes. If Zhong manages to harness the Kraken's power, he'll have history's deadliest weapon at his fingertips, and it's up to Spark and his friends to stop him. Spark's journey takes him to the farthest reaches of the universe, where he encounters great dangers and discovers the secret of his true identity. An action-packed space adventure full of humor and heart, this movie is the story of a boy who takes on great responsibility and in the process discovers his rightful place in the universe. —Redrover/ToonBox furryanthropomorphic animalfoxwilhelm scream Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Spark A Revolution Genres Animation Action Adventure Comedy Family Fantasy Sci-Fi Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG for some action and rude humor Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia This is Jace Norman's first non-television movie.
