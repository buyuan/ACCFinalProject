Gibbs, a former Marine, is a tough investigator and a highly skilled interrogator who relies on his gut instinct as much as evidence. Gibbs' second in command is Senior Field Agent Tony DiNozzo, a womanizing, movie-quoting former Baltimore Homicide Detective, who despite being the class clown always gets the job done. The team also consists of probationary field agent Eleanor Bishop, a former NSA agent, as well as Junior Field Agent Timothy McGee, a computer-savvy agent often mocked by DiNozzo. Assisting them are Abby Sciuto, the energetic-but-Goth lab tech who is like a daughter to Gibbs, and Dr. Donald Mallard, nicknamed Ducky, the eccentric medical examiner full of unusual stories. This team of elite agents, based in Washington, D.C., solve criminal cases involving Marine and Navy personnel and their families, sometimes traveling the United States - or the world - to do it. —NCIS Lover goth girlbabe scientistspecial agentnaval criminal investigative servicepolice procedural58 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Action Crime Drama Mystery Thriller Certificate (Banned) Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Pauley Perrette, who plays Abby, actually graduated from college with a degree in Forensics, and then moved to New York to get her master's, and it was there that she got in to acting, before coming to NCIS. Producers have said that most of the personality and interests displayed by Abby come from Perrette just playing herself. Goofs In the episode "Hiatus Part 2" it is revealed that Gibbs joined NIS (changed the same year to NCIS) in 1992 following the death of his wife and daughter. However, in the JAG episode "Ice Queen" in 2003 he tells Lt.Cmdr. Rabb that he has been an agent for 19 years, which would mean he would have joined NIS in 1984. Quotes Officer Ziva David: Well, you know what they say. You cannot make an omelet without breaking a few legs Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo: She's never making me breakfast. Special Agent Timothy McGee: Uh, Ziva, it's 'without breaking a few eggs.'

Connections Featured in The Jay Leno Show: Episode #1.86 (2010) User reviews386 Review Top review Awesome When the show first started out it was a little shaky, but since then has grown into its own. The characters are believable, both annoying and enchanting, and the plots are wonderful. There's a depth and a comradeship that isn't often showed this well in television. It isn't forced or faked; it's entirely true to life and believable. The underlying sexual tension between several of the characters is also intriguing and interesting to watch, the most obvious of these being the relationship between Tony and Kate, but there's also hints at Kate and Gibbs, McGee and Abby, and so on. It's a crime drama that's both serious and light-hearted, and a wonderful show for anyone who likes fascinating stories, good humor, and great character interaction. helpful•102 43 twylyght86 Dec 7, 2004 FAQ32 What songs are featured on the show?
