The place is Willowpoint Falls. Nobody talks about what happened in the school cloakroom 10 years ago. Now, in the dead of night, Frankie Scarlatti is going to find out why. Genres Fantasy Horror Mystery Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) PG-13 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Rochester, New York, native Frank LaLoggia based the film on a popular and long-standing local urban legend known as "The White Lady." Legend has it that the White Lady had a daughter who disappeared at the hands of a predatory young suitor, and so the White Lady roams the lake front to this very day, searching for her missing daughter. The supposed residence of the White Lady is actually the base of a demolished hotel that was built in the 1800s. Known as the White Lady's Castle, it has become a popular tourist attraction and party site for teenagers. Goofs Though CPR has been commonly used by medical officials since 1957, it wasn't promoted as a technique for the public to learn until the 1970s. Quotes Geno Scarlatti: Where's grandpa? Mama Assunta: He's drowning himself because I hid his cigarettes.

By Harry Revel, Mack Gordon Performed by Bing Crosby Courtesy of CBS Records User reviews100 Review Top review not as good as I once thought I really enjoyed this film when it first came out and so was very excited to get this on dvd as I hadn't seen it in so many years. While not quite upset with what I saw I couldn't help but think my younger self was a lot more forgiving of its faults. I used to like that it combined so many different styles and themes but now think that although this still makes this an interesting film they were not executed that well. I think the idea is good and the performances are excellent, especially Lucas Haas and Alex Rocco but that the script, direction and over-the-top corny moments hinder it. If you don't mind ropey effects and are a sucker for sugar then you may well love this as much as I once did, if you love films and can over-look glaring faults then I would recommend checking it out (the archery scene is still stand out for me and the best part of the film). If you are very discerning it will grate too much, still I don't regret buying it and will no doubt watch it again. helpful•13 13 mattjtemp Jun 23, 2004 FAQ3 What are the differences between the Theatrical Version and the Director's Cut? Why does the killer return to the scene of the crime ten years later? Who is the woman with the red hair that Frankie ASSUMES is the Lady in White?
