Personal Quote: "I am messy. Not really really messy, but I'm not as neat as Tia. She's so neat ! When I go in her closet she has all her pants in one place, her shirts in another, it's all very tidy! Whereas I'm like 'Whatever.' You look in my room and it looks neat enough but if you dared to look under my bed or in my closet, oh what a mess!". Trivia: Her mom, Darlene, is of Bahamian descent. Her father, Tim, is of English and Irish ancestry.
