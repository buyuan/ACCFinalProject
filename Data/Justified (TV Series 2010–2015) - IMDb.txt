That conflict results in a reassignment for Givens to the U.S. District covering the town where he grew up. He is an anachronism, a tough, soft-spoken gentleman who finds his quarry fascinating, but never gives an inch. Dig under his placid skin and you'll find an angry man who grew up hard in rural Kentucky, with an outlaw father, who knows a lot more about who he doesn't want to be than who he really is. —FX Publicity reference to the gunfight at the o.k. corralreference to the o.k. corralgangcowboygunslinger27 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Action Crime Drama Mystery Thriller Western Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Walton Goggins, who was born in Alabama and grew up in Georgia, originally declined the role of Boyd Crowder, out of concern that the show would perpetuate negative stereotypes of Southerners as one-dimensional rednecks and hillbillies. He changed his mind, and did the pilot as a favor to Timothy Olyphant, whom he knew through friends. It was supposed to be one episode only; Boyd originally died at the end of the pilot, as he did in the novel on which the show was based. However, when the character scored well with test audiences, it was decided to reshoot the ending to allow Boyd to survive and become a recurring character. Goofs It is clear from the surrounding countryside in more than a few episodes that while the series is set in SE Kentucky, it isn't filmed there. This includes scenes with treeless mountains in the background and semi-arid landscapes. Quotes Raylan Givens: I shot people I like more for less.

As a fan of both crime fiction & serialized television, this has been on my radar for some time. First, the story is wonderfully structured & grounded in reality (It helps when you shoot on location & cast actors that actually feel like they belong there) The U.S. Marshalls & their multiple duties have always been a great source for story-telling, and this is no different. Second, the cast is perfect for this type of slow-burn law enforcement story. Timothy Olyphant once again nails the 'cowboy' role we've seen him in before(Deadwood, The Crazies). He runs the risk of being type-cast; but if he's always this good in these types of roles, who cares? The rest of the cast is rounded-out by some familiar & not-so-familiar faces, and the whole of them seem to bring their A-game to this project. The third reason this show is quality is the production value. Everything from the costumes(I love the cowboy hat) to the locations & the music have all been perfectly fitting with the story & the characters. This show also sneaks up on you a little bit, once you think Justified isn't 'edgy' enough for FX, something happens to change your mind. It's only similar to the other FX crime shows in that it centers around a really angry guy. I hope Justified & FX continue to pleasantly surprise me. helpful•70 12 kbuttstadt Apr 24, 2010 FAQ5 What is the book that Givens hands to Tim just as he is about to leave the Kentucky office? Is this series based on a novel? Who dies on the show?
