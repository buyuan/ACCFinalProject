As a Black American, I know the struggles of my culture, so to see the trials and tribulations of another culture is eye opening. Ron Howard is an A-list Director and doesn't produce anything that is subpar. The critic reviews and low ratings for this movie are puzzling. Yet I'm seen high ratings for movies to me that weren't so great. The movie is good, don't believe the critics. helpful•130 24 msjarob Nov 28, 2020 FAQ1 How did he get from Yale to Middletown and back in the time period shown. It's over 700 miles.
