All of the Earth's population have crowded into the cities across the planet, now known as Mega-Cities. The crimes in these Mega-Cities became so violent and so powerful, that the regular justice system was powerless to contain, then it collapsed completely. However, a new justice system came from the ashes, there were three justice systems in one (police, jury and executioner), they were called Judges. In Mega-City One (formerly, New York City), there was a Judge, named Joseph Dredd, who was the toughest and most stringent Judge in history. One day, he was charged with murder, and was tried and sentenced to life in prison because of it. —John Wiggins based on comic bookcult filmjudgepolicepolice brutality166 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines One man is Judge, Jury, AND Executioner. Genres Action Crime Sci-Fi Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for continuous violent action Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Director Danny Cannon was so disheartened over his constant creative disputes with Sylvester Stallone that he swore he would never again work with another self-absorbed actor. He also claimed that the final version was completely different from the script due to the changes Stallone demanded. Goofs When Dredd and Fergie are escaping from security after Rico and Griffin murder the high council, Dredd is wearing full Judge uniform. When he enters the room with the hoverbike, he is wearing the shirt. When he sits on the bike, he has lost the shirt and is wearing only a t-shirt. This happens in timespan of him sitting on the bike, he did not have time to remove it. Quotes Judge Dredd: I am the law! Alternate versions The UK video version has been cut by almost 4 secs by the BBFC in three places. Two headbutts have been cut from the fight between Dredd and Mean Machine, as well as Stallone shooting an enemy right after he breaks free. A headbutt has also been cut from the fight between Hershey and Ilsa. The UK cinema version was uncut. A photograph in an SFX magazine article in 1995 showed Dredd shooting a Judge clone, but this scene isn't in the US or UK versions. This scene was also featured in the serialized comic strip adaptation of the film that was printed in Sunday Magazine in 1995.

User reviews285 Review Top review Need I mention that Stallone is HUGE overseas??? I first saw this film in Asia, and thought it was an OK action/sci-fi film (Max von Sydow gave the film his blessing). But when I returned to the U.S. shortly afterwards, I was surprised by how much the film was being vilified. And the reviews didn't seem to bear any relation to the film I saw in Asia. There seems to be an anti-Stallone lobby in the U.S., which attacks every film he makes (even some of the better ones like Cliffhanger and Assassins). I simply don't get it. He happens to have appeared in some of the best action films of the last decade or two. He still commands 8-figure salaries for every film. He lives like some kind of Olympian god. OK, so 'Get Carter' was a pale, pale (PALE) shadow of the original (though beautifully photographed!), but Sylvester Stallone is as big as Jackie Chan overseas. This might make some of you glad that you aren't overseas. It makes me glad that I am (that and the low cost of living). Keep up the good/bad work, Sly! helpful•13 9 tangoviudo Dec 25, 2002 FAQ5 What is 'Judge Dredd' about? Is 'Judge Dredd' based on a book?
