Personal Quote: [on The Hunted (2003)] I trained with the FBI in Portland and I also had many conversations with female FBI agents in Los Angeles, as well. That was again something that also came in very handy for Basic (2003), because I'd learned already how to handle a gun and how to behave just physically when you're in a situation, a threat. That was very good to know. I didn't have to do that again. See more » Trivia: Was in a relationship with drummer Lars Ulrich of Metallica from 2004-2012.
