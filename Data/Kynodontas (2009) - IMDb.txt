The trio spend their days listening to endless homemade tapes that teach them a whole new vocabulary. Any word that comes from beyond their family abode is instantly assigned a new meaning. Hence 'the sea' refers to a large armchair and 'zombies' are little yellow flowers. Having invented a brother whom they claim to have ostracized for his disobedience, the über-controlling parents terrorize their offspring into submission. The father is the only family member who can leave the manicured lawns of their self-inflicted exile, earning their keep by managing a nearby factory, while the only outsider allowed on the premises is his colleague Christina, who is paid to relieve the son of his male urges. Tired of these dutiful acts of carnality, Christina disturbs the domestic balance. —Anonymous overprotective fathermisuse of languageisolated housechild abusesocial isolation259 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines The cat is the most feared animal there is! Genres Drama Thriller Certificate Not Rated Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The inspiration for the film came about because of a discussion Yorgos Lanthimos was having with some friends who were about to get married. When Lanthimos expressed doubts about the institution and family itself, he was struck by the idea about what would happen to a man who went to the ultimate extreme of protecting his family. Goofs In the bathroom scene where the girl is trying to remove her tooth, the girl hits her mouth in front of the mirror with the dumbbell; she laughs and blood runs down her jaw; however, after the cut, the blood disappears. Quotes Older Daughter: Mom, what is a "cunt"? Mother: Where did you learn that word? Older Daughter: On a case on top of the VCR. Mother: A "cunt" is a large lamp. Example: The "cunt" switched off and the room got all dark. Connections Featured in Ebert Presents: At the Movies: The Other Woman/Cold Weather/Louder Than a Bomb/The Housemaid/Sanctum (2011) Soundtracks Fly Me to the Moon Written by Bart Howard Performed by Frank Sinatra User reviews297 Review Top review 10/10 Not that strange or removed from anyones reality A whole language of deceit is created by a father to make sure that his family don't venture into the unknown which he fears will corrupt them. This film talks about the myths and lies we are told to maintain status quo and the appearance of stability and normality. It explores the abuse of protecting a child from outside influences to the extreme of denying human instincts and inquisitiveness about their world. Its shows how telling children lies for their own safety makes them fearful of the world and patronises there innate understanding about life. Its amazing because it creates a world with an absurd, fully realised, vocabulary that is completely understood by the members of this family ; its surreal nature forces you to question the oddness and the parameters of your own existence. A life unquestioned and unexplored leads to a stagnant swamp of confusion. helpful•270 76 riffraffrichard May 13, 2010 FAQ2 Why does the father tell them that "your brother died"?
