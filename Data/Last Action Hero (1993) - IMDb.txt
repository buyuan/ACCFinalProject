When his best friend, Nick the projectionist, gives him a magic ticket to the newest Jack Slater movie, Danny is transported into Slater's world, his number one hero where the good guys always win. It's a dream come true for Danny, but things take a turn for the worse when one of Slater's enemies, Benedict the hit man, gets ahold of the ticket and ends up in Danny's world. Slater and Danny must join forces and travel back and stop him at all costs before it'll be the end of Jack Slater. —Anthony Pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com} villaintaxifuneralvideo storechild drives a car356 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines He's mean . . . And he'll blast through your screen! [DVD cover] Genres Action Adventure Comedy Fantasy Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for strong action sequences Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Filming continued until the week before this movie debuted in theaters. Goofs In the projection booth, when the film is out of focus, Nick goes to adjust it while the credits are rolling, yet the reels on both projectors are empty and not moving. Quotes Danny Madigan: You think you are funny, don't you? Jack Slater: I know I am. I'm the famous comedian Arnold Braunschweiger. Danny Madigan: Schwarzenegger! Jack Slater: Gesundheit. Crazy credits The only opening credits in this film are the ones for "Jack Slater IV". Alternate versions The UK channel 5 version of the movie omits 10 minutes worth of footage to remove profane language violence and scenes that are unsuitable for kids. Connections Edited into They Crawl (2001) Soundtracks A Little Bitter Written by Layne Staley, Jerry Cantrell, Mike Inez and Sean Kinney Produced and Performed by Alice in Chains Courtesy of Columbia Records User reviews335 Review Top review 7/10 One of the most underrated movies I've ever seen - an ingenious satire of action movie clichés Last Action Hero has to be the most underrated movies I've ever seen. I've seen it at least four times, but I still like it. Stuff the critics and enjoy it for what it is: a spoof of action movies and their clichés. It's something that probably hasn't been done before and hasn't been done since (because this was undeservedly bashed, I'd say). I would say that it was poorly received because audiences expected a mindless Rambo or Terminator-style film, rather than a satire. helpful•6 0 alexpeychev Jan 12, 2021 FAQ9 Who is Danny Madigan? Why does Danny constantly irritate Jack? Why does Lt. Dekker constantly shout at Slater?
