Born: December 11, 1987. Died: December 12, 1995. Born September 23, 1996. Genres Drama Fantasy Horror Sci-Fi Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for violence including frightening images, a scene of sexuality and some thematic material Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Robert De Niro had originally planned on merely providing a brief cameo for the film. However, after Director Nick Hamm heard De Niro would be interested in his project, he asked De Niro to participate in a few more scenes that were all filmed within a week. De Niro later regretted this because his name was "splashed over all the advertisements". Goofs When Paul Duncan is driving, a Canadian flag is just about visible in the background.

I guess this film didn't really grip me. You knew from the start where the film was heading, but it seemed to take its sweet time about getting there. Perhaps that's why I found myself nodding off several times, only to be awoken by the obligatory, and repeated use of, shock tactics throughout the film. I can't really think of anything positive to say about this film, but neither can I say anything greatly negative. It was neither good, nor bad. In fact, watching it was very much like being trapped in limbo. There was little to stimulate the audience's minds through most of the movie. It's also irritating to see Hollywood moralising about the evils of cloning through the use of film. I'd hesitate to say it was right, but the last thing reasoned debate on the subject needs is idiot screenwriters cashing in on public fears (and fears that are generated by media misrepresentation, at that) and adding more fuel to the fire. What next, a movie about people turning into flies because they ate genetically modified food crops? This film isn't very good and you won't be seeing it twice even if you do have the foolishness, like me, to watch it once. Lets just hope that this is one film that Hollywood decides NOT to clone in the future. helpful•80 20 Rob_Taylor Jul 16, 2004 FAQ8 What is 'Godsend' about? Is 'Godsend' based on a book?
