For starters, everyone is beautiful - so it completely falls flat on the concept of whether or not love is blind. It's also HIGHLY edited and still incredibly cringe - nearly all the participants have absolutely zero charisma it makes it very hard to watch. Honestly just avoid this piece of garbage all together. helpful•21 3 warden-15731 Jul 22, 2021 Details Edit Release date July 21, 2021 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Official site Netflix Site Language English Also known as وحوش جذّابة Production company Lion Television See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Related news ‘Dance Monsters’ Producer Lime Pictures & Lion TV Plot International Growth, Sign Former Shine Development Boss Jonathan Meenagh Oct 20Deadline Film + TV Who's the Snarky Voice Behind Netflix's Sexy Beasts?
