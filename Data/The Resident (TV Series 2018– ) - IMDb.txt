Connections Featured in This Is Us: I've Got This (2021) User reviews330 Review Top review 8/10 Different than every other hospital drama Sure, most other hospital dramas touch on the broken American healthcare system but The Resident is the first one to make is the focus. Sure, it's kind of corny at times, but at its root it has a great heart - nurses being the unsung heroes, insurance company super villains, new technologies lost on aging surgeons unwilling to hang up their stethoscopes, and the treatment of patients as numbers instead of human beings by hospital administration. Sometimes the way the patients are talked about and treated by the hospital management is harder to watch than any surgical treatment. It's worth a watch. helpful•84 8 molda2 Sep 19, 2018 Details Edit Release date January 21, 2018 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Official site Language English Also known as 住院醫師 Filming locations Atlanta, Georgia, USA Production companies Fuqua Films 3 Arts Entertainment Up Island Films See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news Watch The Resident Online: Season 5 Episode 7 Nov 17TVfanatic The Resident Season 5 Episode 7 Review: Who Will You Be?
