Every single woman is incredibly jealous of Rachel and wants to bring her down. —JAP nouveau richematerialismrich man poor womanelitismtaiwan215 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines The only thing crazier than love is family Genres Comedy Drama Romance Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) rated PG-13 for some suggestive content and language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Most of Awkwafina's lines as Peik Lin Goh were improvised. Goofs When Nick asks Rachel to go to Singapore, he says "Singapore for Spring break". This would place the timing of the film between March and April of the calendar year. However, the Tan Hua (Queen of the Night Flower), which blooms on the second night after they arrive, only blooms between July and October. Quotes Astrid Young Teo: It was never my job to make you feel like a man. I can't make you something you're not. Crazy credits There's a mid-credit scene in which Astrid exchanges glances with a man. Alternate versions In Australia, the film was passed uncut with an M rating for coarse language. The filmmakers then opted to reduce the language in order to obtain a PG classification. For the home video release the film was returned to its uncut M rating.
