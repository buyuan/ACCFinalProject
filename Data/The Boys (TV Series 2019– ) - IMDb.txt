Outside of their heroic personas, most are arrogant and corrupt. The series primarily focuses on two groups: the titular Boys, vigilantes looking to keep the corrupted heroes under control, and the Seven, Vought International's premier superhero team. The Boys are led by Billy Butcher, who despises all superpowered people, and the Seven are led by the egotistical and unstable Homelander. As a conflict ensues between the two groups, the series also follows the new members of each team: Hugh "Hughie" Campbell of the Boys, who joins the vigilantes after his girlfriend is killed in a high-speed collision by the Seven's A-Train, and Annie January/Starlight of the Seven, a young and hopeful heroine forced to face the truth about the heroes she admires. black comedygoreviolencesuperhero versus superheroenhancement drug24 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Never Meet Your Heroes Genres Action Crime Drama Sci-Fi Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Every t-shirt that Mother's Milk wears has a saying, slogan, or music group in plain letters on the front.

Connections Featured in Rich and Jay Talk About The Boys (2019) Soundtracks Get Loud For Me Performed by Gizzle User reviews2.1K Review Top review 10/10 Definitly one of the best series this year First it's just a very interesting take on the whole superhero genre. But there's also a lot more. Great actors, great storyline and very nice picture. I guess for me it's the best superhero series yet, followed by Titans and Umbrella Academy. helpful•693 131 juliankammueller Jul 26, 2019 FAQ7 Are there plans for any more seasons to be made? What's with that fly in a couple of scenes flying in front of people faces?it's clearly some kind of Easter egg or reference, can someone answer this? Will this be available on DVD in the future from amazon?
