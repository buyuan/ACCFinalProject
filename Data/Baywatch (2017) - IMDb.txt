However, this summer, two new eager trainees will join the demanding life-saving program, as well as an insubordinate former Olympic swimmer, who are all called to prove their worth on the lifeguard towers just on time when a new synthetic street drug begins to infest the Emerald Bay: the flakka. Without a doubt, this calls for some serious undercover teamwork action, as the badgeless heroes in spandex comb the beach for shady newcomers and nefarious entrepreneurs with hidden agendas of their own. Can Mitch's band save the bay? —Nick Riganas based on tv serieslifeguardbeachcaliforniamuscleman680 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Don't worry, summer is coming Genres Action Comedy Crime Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for language throughout, crude sexual content, and graphic nudity Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Zac Efron gave Dwayne Johnson all the names to call him in the movie, like One Direction. Goofs They mention a scenario of manta rays flying out of the water stinging people in the chest and subsequently make a joke about Steve Irwin's death. Manta rays are completely harmless and don't have hard, pointed barbs; stingrays do and Steve Irwin was killed by a stingray, not a manta ray. Quotes Summer Quinn: [about CJ Parker] Why does she always look like she's running in slow-mo? Ronnie Greenbaum: You see it too? Summer Quinn: And she always looks wet, but not too wet. Ronnie Greenbaum: Right? She's the reason I believe in God. Crazy credits There is a blooper reel at the credits Alternate versions The Unrated version runs 5 minutes longer and features mostly edited and 4 additional scenes.

Really? I can understand a bit why you guys rates it that low. You probably wanted a good plot. When I walked into the theaters I expected 3 things: Muscles, macho and action. It's not about the plot. It doesn't matter with a cliché-plot, because It's all about what I mentioned. Watch this movie again, and focus on those three things. I loves Baywatch because of these things! helpful•33 21 sigfridpius-56186 Jul 24, 2019 Details Edit Release date May 25, 2017 (United States) Countries of origin United Kingdom China United States Official sites Official Facebook Official Site Languages English Spanish Also known as Đội Cứu Hộ Bãi Biển Filming locations Savannah, Georgia, USA Production companies Paramount Pictures Uncharted Shanghai Film Group See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $69,000,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $58,060,186 Opening weekend US & Canada $18,503,871 May 28, 2017 Gross worldwide $177,856,751 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 56 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Atmos Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 2.39 : 1 Related news ‘Super Pumped’: Jon Bass Joins Showtime Series About Uber From ‘Billions’ Co-Creators Sep 1Deadline Film + TV David Hasselhoff To Star In Comedy ‘C’est Magique!’ For New Outfit South Pointe Pictures, Nicolas Benamou Directing — Cannes Market Jul 14Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the streaming release date of Baywatch (2017) in Japan?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
