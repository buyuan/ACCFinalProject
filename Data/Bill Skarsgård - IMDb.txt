Personal Quote: I started acting when I was nine. I did smaller parts here and there as a kid, and then as I grew older I started resisting it, because I didn't like the idea of being, at the time, number four of the Skarsgård actors. So in high school I majored in science and was like, "Maybe I'll do something rebellious and become a doctor." See more » Trivia: Son of Stellan Skarsgård and My Skarsgård.
