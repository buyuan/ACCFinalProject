Genres Comedy Drama Romance Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for language and some sexual references Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Cameron Crowe had written the role of Drew Baylor with Orlando Bloom in mind. When Crowe originally offered Bloom the part, Bloom was unable to take it due to scheduling conflicts with Kingdom of Heaven (2005). Crowe then cast Ashton Kutcher in the part but later felt that Kutcher and co-star Kirsten Dunst had no chemistry and decided to let him go. Crowe then pushed his January 2004 start shoot date back to July 2004 for a summer shoot. Many young actors that included Seann William Scott, James Franco, Colin Hanks and Chris Evans auditioned for the part of Drew. Scott was seriously considered and nearly nabbed the part but Crowe pushed to get Bloom instead. When Bloom was able to work the film into his schedule, Crowe cast him in the part. Goofs While Drew is Driving into Elizabethtown and is waving to all the townsfolk you can see reflections in the windows of some buildings, The reflections are of the car that Drew is in and it is on a trailer with a camera attached to the bonnet. Quotes Claire Colburn: So you failed. Alright you really failed. You failed. You failed. You failed. You failed. You failed. You failed. You failed. You failed. You failed. You failed. You failed. You failed. You think I care about that? I do understand. You wanna be really great? Then have the courage to fail big and stick around. Make them wonder why you're still smiling. Crazy credits This film opens with the 1954 "VistaVision" Paramount Pictures logo - instead of the new 'live-action' one. This logo was used at the head of all Paramount films released from the mid-1950s through to 1986.

Under license from EMI Film & Television Music User reviews535 Review Top review 8/10 How could so many critics have panned this amazing film? For the critics who say this film meanders and rambles, I have to say this: When your dad dies, your life meanders and rambles. I can't speak for everyone who has lost a father but I can speak for myself, and I thought it was spot-on in it's portrayal of the confusing roller-coaster that surrounds the death of a parent. Elizabethtown has all of the things you'd expect from a Cameron Crowe movie: a unique and personal story, great music, beautiful cinematography, surprising humor (I was actually choking from laughing so hard during the videotape scene) and very real and touching moments. I thought the acting was great. Orlando Bloom gave a touching and subtle performance. Kirsten Dunst's accent did go in and out a bit, but she and Bloom had such great chemistry that it didn't bother me at all. Susan Sarandon was perfect, Alec Baldwin was hilarious, the Elizabethtown residents were quirky and fun...if I have a complaint it's that the amazing Judy Greer was underutilized. Overall, this movie had everything that a great movie should have. Shame on the critics who panned it simply because it didn't follow the usual Hollywood plot mapthis film is about taking the scenic route and making the trip meaningful, and that's what it did. helpful•329 118 porterkelly Oct 24, 2005 Details Edit Release date October 14, 2005 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Official site (United Kingdom) Paramount Pictures (United States) Language English Also known as Thị Trấn Tình Yêu Filming locations Elizabethtown, Kentucky, USA Production companies Paramount Pictures Cruise/Wagner Productions Vinyl Films See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $45,000,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $26,850,426 Opening weekend US & Canada $10,618,711 Oct 16, 2005 Gross worldwide $52,164,016 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 2 hours 3 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news "The Sheik" Blu-ray Special Edition Coming From Paramount Aug 19Cinemaretro.com Mommie Dearest Celebrates Blu-ray Debut with Commentary by Hedda Lettuce [Exclusive] Jun 2MovieWeb Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Japanese language plot outline for Elizabethtown (2005)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
