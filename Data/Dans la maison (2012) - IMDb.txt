Genres Drama Mystery Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for sexual content and language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Ernst Umhauer said this about the character he plays in the movie: "He confuses his writing with reality and turns everything in his path upside-down. He has no distance, it takes him a long time to realize his words are stinging and can do damage. He's smart, but not very conscious of his responsibility". Goofs (at around 1h 35 mins) While Claude is walking through park, his hair is parted on different sides between shots. Quotes Claude Garcia: But I love you. Esther Artole: No. It's not me you love. It's an image. An image in your head. Crazy credits The opening credits are shown as if they were hand-written on graph paper. Connections Referenced in La noche de...: La noche de... En la casa (2018) Soundtracks Dynasty Tching Memories Interprete par Wang Shu Imperial Orchestra Arrangement de Thierry Woelfel ®2002 FGL Productions S.A, © Editions FGL Avec l'aimable autorisation de FGL Productions S.A User reviews52 Review Top review 8/10 Wicked A wicked little movie that tries to brake boundaries and more than the fourth wall. It raises up a lot of questions and puts up the mirror to a lot of things, while continuously being funny and wicked at the same time. A hilarious attempt at describing what Art means nowadays or how we try to interpret it. Maybe even how we try to create it. There is more than one story strand in this movie and they all get at least somewhat explored. And while some of those strands may feel like a cliché, the head on approach make them feel like a fresh take on it. You have to have an open mind about the movie and the way it is shot and told, but if you can do that, you might be able to enjoy this very much. Multiple views can also bring up new and exciting things you might not have seen first time around. Whatever the case, I can recommend this to anyone who wants to be intellectually challenged by watching a movie. helpful•16 3 kosmasp Jul 18, 2013 Details Edit Release date October 10, 2012 (France) Country of origin France Official sites Official Facebook Official site (Japan) Language French Also known as In the House Filming locations Cinéma Le Lido, 70 avenue de la République, Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, Val-de-Marne, France Production companies Mandarin Films Mars Films France 2 Cinéma See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross US & Canada $389,757 Opening weekend US & Canada $31,441 Apr 21, 2013 Gross worldwide $16,190,771 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 45 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Lifetime Announces Two-Picture Deal With Sarah Drew Nov 1Variety Film + TV HBO Max Acquires Season 2 Of ‘David Makes Man’, Five ’90s-Era WBTV Sitcoms Nov 1Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Japanese language plot outline for Dans la maison (2012)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
