After Joan's death, Tom met teacher Abby, and they were married to make the family feel complete again. The kids all had friends and relationships as well, turning the Bradford Bunch into a free-for-all of loved ones and family members. —Marty McKee <mmckee@soltec.net> three sonsfive daughterslaugh trackfamily relationshipssitcom5 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Warm New Family Comedy! From the Producers of "The Waltons" Genres Comedy Drama Family Certificate TV-G Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia David Bradford was originally played by Mark Hamill, who appeared in Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) the year this show began. Alternate versions Originally, Diana Hyland was credited for appearing in ALL 9 shows from season 1. She missed half of them, due to her illness, which eventually claimed her life. In half of those shows, there were originally scenes where they explained her absence, and even voice-overs from Hyland as Joan on the phone with Tom Bradford. During the summer reruns, Lorimar aired only the shows she did not appear in. Lorimar decided to go back and reedit the shows she did not appear in, remove her credit, and all scenes featuring said phone calls and voice-overs. These are the versions of those season 1 shows that have been in use ever since. Connections Featured in America's Teenagers Growing Up on Television (1998) User reviews11 Review Top review 10/10 Excellent family show that stands the test of time. I loved Eight is Enough growing up. Age wise, I was in between Tommy and Nicholas, so I enjoyed those two the most. Plus, I think they had more story lines given to them than the others. I think there were just too many girls for any of them to stand out to me and David was way too old for me to relate to. I liked the balance of drama and comedy. I could be laughing about one part of the show and crying about another part. I believe the death of the mother (Joan) set this show apart from the other big family shows (The Waltons, The Brady Bunch). They dealt with it pretty realistically. And when Abby joined the family, the kids continued to call her Abby instead of mom, which was much more believable. Ironically, Abby became my favorite character and I think Betty Buckley was the best actor in the bunch. But I enjoyed pretty much every Bradford and loved their big family scenes the most. Eight is Enough was an excellent family show that still stands the test of time. helpful•5 3 lakesgirl2 Apr 29, 2014 Details Edit Release date March 15, 1977 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Ocho son suficientes Filming locations Santa Clarita, California, USA Production company Lorimar Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour Color Color Sound mix Mono Aspect ratio 1.33 : 1 Related news Markie Post, Plucky TV Favorite Who Became a Star on ‘Night Court,’ Dies at 70 Aug 8Variety Film + TV The Netflix Effect Could Help ‘Cobra Kai’s” Ralph Macchio Land An Emmy Nom May 27Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Eight Is Enough (1977) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
