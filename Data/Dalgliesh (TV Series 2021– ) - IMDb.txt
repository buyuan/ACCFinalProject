Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Crime Drama Mystery Parents guide Add content advisory User reviews22 Review Top review 6/10 If you're a PD James fan, you'll probably enjoy it. Never really been a fan of PD James (Phyllis Dorothy James) and her main sleuth Adam Daigliesh of the Met (Scotland Yard). Roy Marsden played him in a number of episodes and they were ok. I too only watched the first two episodes of the current series and I'm not that impressed, but I will watch the last four episodes and maybe it will improve. Bertie Carvel and Jeremy Irvine are fine actors, no slight intended to their skills. I prefer the characters of Colin Dexter (Morse, Lewis and Endeavour) and Ann Cleeves (Vera and Shetland) over PD James and Ruth Rendell. Even Christie's characters are much more interesting. Very dark episodes, like something set in the 1800s not in 2021. helpful•1 0 Avidviewer-02847 Nov 15, 2021 Details Edit Release date November 4, 2021 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Also known as Инспектор Адам Дэлглиш Production company New Pictures See more company credits at IMDbPro Related news AMC launches AMC+ streaming bundle in Australia Nov 9IF.com.au Acorn TV's Dalgliesh: Your First Look at New Series Based on P.D.
