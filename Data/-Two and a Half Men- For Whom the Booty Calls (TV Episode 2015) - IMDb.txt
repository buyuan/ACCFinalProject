Rather then answering his many questions about adoptive parenting, she refers him to a fathers support group. That male bonding without strings or clingy Alan is just what Walden needed, but when Walden hosts the group, his 'spunge spouse' wriggles in against explicit promises. —KGF Vissers singing in falsettosupport groupsleeping on a couchadoptionmale bonding6 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Comedy Romance Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Connections References The Good Wife (2009) User reviews Be the first to review Details Edit Release date January 22, 2015 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Filming locations Stage 26, Warner Brothers Burbank Studios - 4000 Warner Boulevard, Burbank, California, USA Production companies Chuck Lorre Productions The Tannenbaum Company Warner Bros.
