Genres Drama Romance Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for some strong language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The idea for the movie came from the backgrounds of both Richard Linklater and Kim Krizan. Linklater spent a night walking around Philadelphia with Amy, a woman he randomly met. Krizan rode around Europe on trains meeting people and on one trip met a Norwegian man on the way to Paris, and ended up walking around the city all night much like Before Sunrise (1995). Krizan has never revealed whether or not they had a romance that night and they lost contact. Linklater and Amy stayed in touch for a while, until contact was lost and he never heard from her again. It was not until 2010 that Linklater found out that Amy had died in a traffic accident before the release of Before Sunrise (1995), the first film in the trilogy. Krizan has never re-connected with the Norwegian man that was her inspiration for the famous night of walking around a European city. Goofs Jesse and Celine walk towards the back of the train heading for the dining car. As they enter the dining car, the train is now traveling in the opposite direction, backwards. Quotes Celine: Isn't everything we do in life a way to be loved a little more?

'Before Sunrise' is not a film to be scrutinised, nor studied. The absolute beauty of it lies in its perfection as a simple love story - of two lives suddenly thrown together in the midst of reality, and the ensuing night of simple love that follows. Every individual at some time in life dreams of the connection that is portrayed in this film between Jesse and Celine, and few ever find it. 'Before Sunrise' simply and elegantly demonstrates how the most fundamental passions of human emotion can envelope two complete strangers. The beauty of this film is that the story is the most important element. The ending is both provocative and emotional - scenes of the night previously seen in darkness are now portrayed in lonely daylight as the sun rises and the story closes on these two characters. I saw this film by accident one night late on television. I have never forgotten it. So well is it made that the audience never question if this could ever really happen in life, reality being so absolutely characterised in it. 'Before Sunrise' is simply the story of two strangers bound in Vienna's lonely night splendour - one night of love in all its glory, one superb piece of film making. helpful•283 36 lady_writer Mar 8, 2000 FAQ2 What are the albums that the Jesse character flips through in the record shop scene?
