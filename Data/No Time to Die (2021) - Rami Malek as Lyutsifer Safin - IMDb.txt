We tell each other lies about the fight for free will and independence, but we don't really want that. We want to be told how to live and then die when we're not looking. People want oblivion, and a few of us are born to build it for them. So here I am - their invisible god sneaking under their skin. James Bond : You know, history isn't kind to men who play God. Lyutsifer Safin : And you don't? We both eradicate people to make the world a better place. I just want it to be... tidier. Lyutsifer Safin : James Bond. History of violence, license to kill, vendetta with Ernst Blofeld, in love with Madeleine Swann. I could be speaking to my own reflection. James Bond : We've made slightly different choices. Lyutsifer Safin : No. We've just developed different methods for the same goal. Only your skills die with your body. Mine will survive long after I'm gone. And life is all about leaving something behind, isn't it? Lyutsifer Safin : We both eradicate people to make the world a better place. I just want it to be... tidier. Lyutsifer Safin : I want the world to evolve, yet you want it to stay the same. Let's face it - I've made you redundant. James Bond : No. Not as long as there are people like you in the world. Madeleine : It's difficult to lose a parent, especially at a young age. Lyutsifer Safin : Yes. Death has a particular effect in children, doesn't it? Madeleine : What effect did it have on you? Lyutsifer Safin : Profound. But I saved a life once. I think that had more of an effect. Madeleine : Why is that? Lyutsifer Safin : Saving someone's life connects you to them forever, the same as taking it. They belong to you. Lyutsifer Safin : Careful! She's light as a feather...
