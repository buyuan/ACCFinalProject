Genres Drama Horror Mystery Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for strong violence, disturbing images, suggestive content, partial nudity and brief strong language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The film is an adaptation of a 2010 graphic novel by writer Pierre Oscar Lévy and artist Frederik Peeters called Sandcastle. When asked what inspired him to adapt the book to film, director M. Night Shyamalan explained: "The book gave me the opportunity to work through a lot of anxieties I had around death and aging, and things like my parents getting older." Goofs Regarding the hair/nails theory aka cop-out , older Trent has got a very obvious 5 o'clock shadow which suggests he would have had to shave to achieve.

Connections Featured in The 2021 NBA Finals: Game 2 (2021) Soundtracks Remain Written by Saleka Shyamalan (as Saleka Night Shyamalan) Performed by Saleka Shyamalan (as Saleka Night Shyamalan) User reviews1.4K Review Top review 5/10 Nothing Special The concept is interesting and I would say that the execution is mostly interesting but it just feels like it's missing something. The movie seems to move at a rapid pace but not much happens. It's tough when you only have 1 major set in a movie. It can be hard to keep interest. This sort of strikes in the middle for me with that. Is it boring no, is it something I would watch again, no. I was actually more interested by the end part but we only get like 10 minutes of that story. The filmmaking was just horrendous for me too. It was such a misstep for me, it was full of tight shots and tight pan shots that were just so nauseating and made you feel like you were lost. It was such a mistake for me. helpful•8 0 Golden_Hope Nov 13, 2021 Details Edit Release date July 23, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Official Facebook Official Instagram Language English Also known as 诡老 Filming locations Dominican Republic Production companies Universal Pictures Blinding Edge Pictures Perfect World Pictures See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross US & Canada $48,242,510 Opening weekend US & Canada $16,854,735 Jul 25, 2021 Gross worldwide $90,112,510 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 48 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Atmos Aspect ratio 2.39 : 1 Related news Alex Wolff To Star Opposite Kiersey Clemons In Sophie Kargman’s Thriller ‘Susie Searches’ Nov 16Deadline Film + TV ‘No Time to Die’ Sweeps VOD Charts as Netflix Originals Dominate the Streamer’s Top 10 Nov 15Indiewire Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the running time for Old (2021)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
