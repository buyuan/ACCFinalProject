One of the show's executive producers, Reza Aslan, responded to the criticism, tweeting, "Maybe learn a little about the show, its creators, its producers, its four Afghan writers, its plot, and pretty much everything else before you announce your opinion of it. Just a thought." User reviews97 Review Top review 6/10 United States Of Dumb Comedy WTF IS THIS SHOW??
