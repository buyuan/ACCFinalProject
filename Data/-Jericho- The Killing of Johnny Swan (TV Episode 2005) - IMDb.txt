The upcoming race between Swan and a Soviet runner was a national obsession, and the police must determine if international intrigue or a simple domestic triangle is at the heart of the crime. —Ron Kerrigan <mvg@whidbey.com> runnerdouble murdertrack and field Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Crime Drama Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia This was the only episode of this series not to take its title from a poem by T.S. Eliot. User reviews2 Review Top review 9/10 atmospheric and best of the four... Jericho was such a curates egg. Brilliant acting ... good cogent stories spoiled by an artificial style ... a sort of faux Noire ... often murky camera .... ultra closeups and a sound design leading to difficult to hear dialogue. (A problem the BBC suffers from a lot) That said, this is the best episode of the four that make up the series. A chilling Peter Bowles ... a sympathetic and expertly measured performance by William Ash as Johnny are only two amongst a really fabulous set of performances. If the final scenes do not get to you then you have no heart. So be prepared... there are twists and twists.... helpful•1 0 hamlet-16 Dec 3, 2017 Details Edit Release date October 23, 2005 (United States) Country of origin United Kingdom Language English See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 33 minutes Color Color Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
