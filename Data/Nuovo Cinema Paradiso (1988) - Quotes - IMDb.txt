You believe nothing will ever change. Then you leave: a year, two years. When you come back, everything's changed. The thread's broken. What you came to find isn't there. What was yours is gone. You have to go away for a long time... many years... before you can come back and find your people. The land where you were born. But now, no. It's not possible. Right now you're blinder than I am. Salvatore: Who said that? Gary Cooper? James Stewart? Henry Fonda? Eh? Alfredo: No, Toto. Nobody said it. This time it's all me. Life isn't like in the movies. Life... is much harder. 181 of 181 found this interesting Interesting? Yes No | Share this Share this: Facebook | Twitter | Permalink Hide options Alfredo: Get out of here! Go back to Rome. You're young and the world is yours. I'm old. I don't want to hear you talk anymore. I want to hear others talking about you. Don't come back. Don't think about us. Don't look back. Don't write. Don't give in to nostalgia. Forget us all. If you do and you come back, don't come see me. I won't let you in my house. Understand? Salvatore: Thank you. For everything you've done for me. Alfredo: Whatever you end up doing, love it. The way you loved the projection booth when you were a little squirt. 105 of 106 found this interesting Interesting? Yes No | Share this Share this: Facebook | Twitter | Permalink Hide options Alfredo: Once upon a time, a king gave a feast. And there came the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Now, a soldier, who was standing guard, saw the king's daughter go by. She was the most beautiful one, and he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do when it came to the daughter of the king? Well, finally, one day, he managed to meet her, and he told her that he could no longer live without her. The princess was so impressed by his strong feelings that she said to the soldier: "If you can wait 100 days and 100 nights under my balcony, then at the end of it, I shall be yours." Damn! The soldier immediately went there and waited one day. And two days. And ten. And then twenty. And every evening, the princess looked out of her window, but he never moved. During rain, during wind, during snow, he was always there. The bird shat on his head, and the bees stung him, but he didn't budge. After ninety nights, he had become all dried up, all white, and the tears streamed from his eyes. He couldn't hold them back. He no longer had the strength to sleep. All that time, the princess watched him. And on the 99th night, the soldier stood up, took his chair, and went away. Salvatore: [later in the film, Toto gives Alfredo his interpretation] ... In one more night, the princess would have been his. But she also could not possibly have kept her promise. And it would have been terrible. He would have died. This way, however, at least for 99 days, he was living under the illusion that she was there, waiting for him. 72 of 73 found this interesting Interesting?

There's nothing you can do. 5 of 5 found this interesting Interesting?

Maria Di Vita - Older: I never asked for any. You don't have to explain anything to me. I always thought you did what was right. Why dwell on it? You were right to leave. You did what you wanted to do. Every time I call you, a different woman answers. But I never heard in any of their voices that they really loved you. I would've known. All the same, I'd have liked to see you settled down in love with someone. But your life is there. Here there are only ghosts. 3 of 3 found this interesting Interesting?

You've nothing else to do. You talk to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like an idiot. You work like a dog. Even holidays - Easter, Christmas. You only get Good Friday off. And if they hadn't stuck Christ on a cross we'd even work then. Salvatore 'Tot√≤' Di Vita - Child: So why don't you change jobs? Alfredo: Because I'm a nitwit. Who else around here could run a projector? Nobody. It takes an imbecile like me. I never had any luck. 2 of 2 found this interesting Interesting?
