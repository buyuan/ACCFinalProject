Okay, this was one of those really, really dated adventure games on the C64. The kind that was made entirely of text written on a screen and you typed in what you wanted the character to do. How on earth people managed to play these (me included) is beyond belief. Especially as this game was nigh-impossible. The game began with Bruce Banner tied hand and foot to a chair, for some reason. How do you get out? Type in 'bite lip'. This makes Bruce get mad and turn into the Hulk. Obviously breaking free from the chair. But gas floods the room you are in, for some reason, and you turn back into Bruce. There is a ring on the floor but it's too heavy to lift. There is a button on the wall. I can't remember what it's for. If you walk out of the room (actually a big glass dome, for some reason) you will suffer the mercy of high gravity, for some reason, and be crushed and die and go into a state of limbo. For some reason. It was infuriating. My best pal and I puzzled over this game for far longer than it was worth. I remember once actually being able to get outside of the dome but ants came along and ate the Hulk, for some reason. Since no one ever remembers or has heard of this game I guess no one will ever, ever read my review. helpful•18 0 CuriosityKilledShawn May 19, 2005 Details Edit Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Questprobe Featuring the Hulk Production company Adventure International See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Color Color Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
