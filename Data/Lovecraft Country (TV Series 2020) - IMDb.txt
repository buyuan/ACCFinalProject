Genres Drama Fantasy Horror Mystery Sci-Fi Thriller Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Jamie Chung said in an interview that she had no problem being completely naked for her first ever nude scene in episode six of the first season because physicality is so important to her character. But she joked that she still doesn't want her parents to watch. She specifically told them, "I'm so proud of my work, but please, for the love of God, just don't."

I was hooked & raving about it to anyone who would listen..... So what happened after the initial 10 I gave it? Well for me it jus lost it's way & tried to cover toooo many subplots with a good handful along PC lines which I didnt think really fitted with the main theme, which was racism in 50's America in a fantasy setting . If they had stuck to those main 2 themes I think they had a real winner here but it morphed off into 20mins sub plots with no real part in the story eg his gay dad's escapades in the middle of an episode?? relevance?? NONE! After the initial opening, which alone is worth the watch it stayed strong before disappearing up its own ar$e at times in the middle before a great tale set in Korea which again you could watch as a standalone, before again we descended into a bit of a mis-mash. So much promise but in the end sadly didn't really deliver as it tried to cover too many (irrelevant) bases along the way. helpful•135 61 elli56 Oct 28, 2020 FAQ2 Will this have any connection whatsoever (other than the title) to the works of H.P. Lovecraft? Is the character "Ruby Dandridge" Dorothy Dandridge's mother, or named after her?
