In New York City, the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as the Special Victims Unit. These are their stories. —John Craig shared universeampersand in titlepunctuation in titlesexually motivatedsexually motivated assault47 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Where Risks are Taken. Genres Crime Drama Mystery Thriller Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Mariska Hargitay is a trained rape crisis counselor. Goofs Despite many of the crimes being homicides in addition to being sex crimes, homicide detectives are not shown to have responded to the case. The major crime would be the murder itself, with the sex crime elements being included offenses. Quotes [Looking through a victim's purse for ID] Olivia Benson: No jewelry. I always carry at least a pair of earrings in my purse. Elliot Stabler: Yeah, like you carry a purse. Olivia Benson: That's 'cause you carry it for me. Elliot Stabler: Heh... Crazy credits From the second episode of the second season (2000-2001), the opening credits break the pattern followed by the earlier episodes of SVU, the original Law & Order, and Criminal Intent. Instead of the credits ending with a shot of the cast walking towards the camera, they instead are shown sitting around a desk. Connections Featured in The 54th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards (2002) Soundtracks I'm Not Driving Anymore (remix) Written and Performed by Rob Dougan User reviews357 Review Top review Incredibly Solid Show I hear on tv that apparently America's favorite Law and Order is the original. I personally think this is the best one out of all of them. It tackles some pretty intersting sides of society and humanity within an hour. I've been watching it for awhile and fell in love with the cast. They all have that hard edge that comes from doing a job like their's. Marishka is great and Ice-T is amusing. The storylines are very interesting and groundbreaking. In my classes, I've heard about the Down-Low phenomenon amongst black males in the U.S. This is the first show, aside from Oprah, that dealt with this issue. I was amazed and pleased that they'll take on any topic within their framework. Their guest cast should be praised as well. They have a great casting director. I don't know about their history with Emmy nominations, but they should definitely be in the running. The show has a very easy going nature despite the hardness of the cast that works well and acted beautifully. It gives a real look at society's imperfections and discriminatory ideologies. Nobody on the show is perfect and even the lawyers manipulate the law beyond the usual scope people think they do. Instead, they are manipulating it to see justice done and not avoided. I would urge anyone to watch this show. Give it a look. helpful•63 22 QueenMakeda84 Apr 22, 2004 FAQ20 Why did [name of actor/character] leave the show?
