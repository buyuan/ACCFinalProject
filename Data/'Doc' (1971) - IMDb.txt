There, he challenges a man to poker, betting his horse against his opponent's fiance. Doc wins and from now on, Katie Fisher, also known as Katie Elder, will follow him wherever he goes. Their next destination is Tombstone, where the law is represented by Sheriff Wyatt Earp. When they arrive, the election campaign is in full swing. Earp runs for candidate but the Clantons, a family gang of outlaw cowboys, are not among his keenest supporters. Conflict erupts following the failure of some shadowy bargaining and Doc decides to join Wyatt and his brothers. The four of them gather at the O.K. Corral where the seven Clanton brothers are waiting for them. —Guy Bellinger arizona territoryarizonarevisionist westerndusttown185 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines There has never been a Western like "Doc" Genre Western Certificate R Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The film takes place in 1881. Goofs When playing a card game, Doc bets his horse against Kate. When Doc shuffles the cards, he lays them on the table for Ike to cut. Ike cuts the deck to Doc's left. The camera angle when Doc picks up the cards, is from behind him and Doc picks the cards on the left and puts them back on the deck the way they were before Ike cut them. Quotes Wyatt Earp: They're bad people, John. Doc Holliday: Well, if it weren't for bad people, what would you do for a living, Marshal? Tell me about Tombstone. I mean, more than what you said in the letter. Wyatt Earp: It's wide open. The sheriff here, Johnny Behan, doesn't know how to organize a town, so I'm going to run against him in the election. The sheriff has got all the power here. The marshal has got a badge and he's got some territory, but he's got no jurisdiction in the town. Gambling is heavy. There's a lot of money about town. It's wide open. So you organize the gambling - start right here. I run the law, you run the gambling. We'll both end up rich. Very rich! Doc Holliday: We sound like bad people, Wyatt. Wyatt Earp: We are, John. Alternate versions All UK versions are cut by 5 secs to remove a cockfight. Connections Featured in Truth Be Told: Stacy Keach on Frank Perry's 'Doc' (2016) User reviews32 Review Top review 8/10 Keach at the Top of Form! Stacy Keach, who plays Doc Holliday in this film, made some incredible films between 1968 and 1974 and this is a Western epic (where he's the lead for a change) and kicks some Western butt on an old legend about Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday, the west and Faye Dunaway plays Kate. Check out this early 70's GOOD FILM about America. Harris Yulin (who nobody knows) did plays and other films with Keach in the good old days - I'm not even into westerns since The Wild Bunch and The Man With No Name fllms, this script was Pretty Much on the mark about these cats! The old west, no guns allowed in Tombstone (SAYS WHO?) These guys, with worthy adversaries, and great dialogue in a movie nobody saw (unless, in 1971, you were a revisionist like Squint Eastwood did 20 years later in Unforgiven (a great film). Anyway, if you can find it (and Judy Collins' kid brother plays Billy in this) the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral will never be the same (no matter what your fantasies are concerning Western fact). Keach was the man for seven years. Trust me - I saw him on stage in New York and London. Well worth your time (Keach, Dunaway, and Harris Yulin fans), especially if you like Westerns cutting against the grade (even then); highly recommended (resembles The Hired Hand by Peter Fonda). helpful•14 10 shepardjessica Jul 5, 2004 Details Edit Release date August 4, 1971 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Doc Filming locations Old Tucson - 201 S.
