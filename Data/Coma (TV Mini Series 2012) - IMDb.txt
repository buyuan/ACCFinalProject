Genres Drama Mystery Sci-Fi Thriller Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia Lead actress Lauren Ambrose was actually born in the same year that the original film version of Coma (1978) was made. Connections Version of Coma (1978) User reviews17 Review Top review Great Scott Not One would have thought that something produced by Ridley Scott, who directed Alien and Blade Runner, would have been tightly knit. It wasn't. The movie totally drags during the first half and the first hour of the second half. This, like the original, should have been a two-hour film. I was bothered from the start when during the first commercial break, there were cast interviews revealing what was going to happen. The only thing really interesting were the special effects towards the end. Fortunately, I recorded it and was able to use fast forward or I, too, might have lapsed into a coma from having to sit through all of the initial tedium. helpful•18 8 Minerva_Meybridge Sep 6, 2012 Details Edit Release date September 3, 2012 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Official site Language English Also known as Кома Filming locations Atlanta, Georgia, USA Production companies Scott Free Productions Warner Bros.
