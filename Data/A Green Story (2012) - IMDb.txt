He arrived in the US hoping for a better future for him and his family. Eftichios as is his Greek name not only managed to live the American dream for himself, but also created Earth Friendly Products, a US giant for environmentally friendly cleaning products. His story is not only about transforming his life but also the lives of the ones around him as the owner and CEO of Earth Friendly Products. The story centers on the modern day Vlahakis (played by Ed O'Ross), who is diagnosed with cancer and given only few months to live. During this time, he reflects on his early life as an immigrant (played by George Finn) during the 1950's and ultimately decides to push himself to the limit by closing one final business deal that will concretize his company's success, even if it means taking on a large corporation that is trying to take over his company. —IvanWong three word title Plot summary Add synopsis Genre Biography Certificate Not Rated Parents guide Add content advisory User reviews Be the first to review Details Edit Release date July 18, 2013 (Greece) Countries of origin United States Greece Official sites Official Facebook Official site Languages English Greek German Also known as Mia prasini istoria Filming locations Athens, Greece Production companies Paramyth Films Parmyth Films Greece See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $850,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $12,901 Opening weekend US & Canada $6,768 May 26, 2013 Gross worldwide $12,901 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 30 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 Related news Michael Vartan Set To ‘Punch It’ Jan 15Deadline Feelgood acquires Green Story for Greece Jun 5ScreenDaily Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
