It shows how you can overcome different dynamics and personalities to come together as a team. It's not about who has the best skills, but who gives all for a team and prove to yourself you are not a quitter. Everyday hard working average people is what this show is about. helpful•10 2 gwenrking Aug 27, 2020 Details Edit Release date July 8, 2020 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Official site Language English Also known as Tough As Nails Production companies Raquel Productions Tough House Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news 2021-22 TV Show Season Ratings (week eight) Nov 16TVSeriesFinale.com CBS 2021-22 TV Season Ratings (updated 11/16/2021) Nov 16TVSeriesFinale.com Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Spanish language plot outline for Tough as Nails (2020)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
