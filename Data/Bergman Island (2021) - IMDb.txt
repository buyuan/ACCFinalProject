Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Greta Gerwig and John Turturro originally signed on for the two main parts, but both had to bow out before shooting began. Gerwig was replaced with Vicky Krieps, and Turturro with Owen Wilson. However, Owen Wilson later declined with mere weeks to go before shooing. Mia Hansen-Løve and her producer decided to shoot half of the movie in summer 2018 without an actor in the male lead. The second half was shot one year later, in summer 2019 with Tim Roth finally cast in the male lead.
