It is at once a mundane yet compelling look in and around a Homicide unit of the Baltimore Police Department, a group of determined individuals who are committed to their grim job at hand. —Karina Santos <tallulahg@aol.com> social commentaryjusticeviolencepolice stationbased on real person9 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Crime Drama Mystery Thriller Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia A real live criminal, on the run from the Baltimore Police Department, entered the set of Homicide: Life on the Street (1993) and surrendered to the actors in uniform. This incident was later spoofed in an episode where the actors in the show chased a suspect onto the set of "Homicide" and encountered the director, Barry Levinson, and several of their favorite actors from the show. Goofs In a number of episodes, in-vehicle shots with a "back seat" perspective often show that the vehicle being filmed in is in fact a Chrysler-produced sedan. Note the older star-in-pentagon emblem on the steering wheel instead of the Chevy Cavaliers that the detectives drive. This is likely due to the lower headroom in the Cavalier, making it difficult to film that perspective. Quotes Det. Tim Bayliss: You never say please. You never say thank you. Det. Frank Pembleton: Please don't be an idiot. Thank you. Connections Featured in The 45th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards (1993) User reviews96 Review Top review The Power of the Loyal Viewer(and Critics)! This show is an excellent drama of which you will rarely find on network TV(perhaps NYPD Blue in its first five or six years,St.Elsewhere,L.A.Law,Hill Street Blues might compare). This show,set in the Homicide division(of course) of the Baltimore Police Department and centered around the elite detectives of the precinct was an edgy,intense show which took some big-time chances(For example:One episode was set exclusively around two of the detectives grilling a suspect)and it's time slot,Friday nights at 10 eastern/9 central,made this a constant candidate for the cancellation blocks,but the loyal viewer-ship and the loud protestations of TV critics helped keep this show afloat for the six and a half years it ran. The acting and writing were by far some of the best on network t.v.,the characters fleshed out by Andre Braugher,Yaphett Kotto(As the chief),Ned Beatty,Melissa Leo,Isabella Hoffman,Clark Johnson,Daniel Baldwin,Kyle Secor,Reed Diamond and long-time stand-up comedian Richard Belzer,who has found his niche as a dramatic actor(and as the SAME character,Detective John Munch,in no fewer than five TV shows,now on Law and Order:Special Victims UNit)stand out maybe the most! I believe they could even revive this show someday in the future with some different characters in the roles and,with roughly the same writing and exactly the same kind of no-hold-barred risk-taking,could be at least half as good,if not equal. helpful•37 7 KUAlum26 Apr 27, 2005 FAQ7 Can the police really lie to you? Do the police always need a search warrant? How realistic is the portrayal of police detectives on Homicide?
