All of Phil's romance, power and fragility is trapped in the past and in the land: He can castrate a bull calf with two swift slashes of his knife; he swims naked in the river, smearing his body with mud. He is a cowboy as raw as his hides. The year is 1925. The Burbank brothers are wealthy ranchers in Montana. At the Red Mill restaurant on their way to market, the brothers meet Rose, the widowed proprietress, and her impressionable son Peter. Phil behaves so cruelly he drives them both to tears, revelling in their hurt and rousing his fellow cowhands to laughter - all except his brother George, who comforts Rose then returns to marry her. As Phil swings between fury and cunning, his taunting of Rose takes an eerie form - he hovers at the edges of her vision, whistling a tune she can no longer play. His mockery of her son is more overt, amplified by the cheering of Phil's cowhand disciples. Then Phil appears to take the boy under his wing. Is this latest gesture a softening that leaves Phil exposed, or a plot twisting further into menace? —Netflix 20th centurybrothercowboy1920sbased on novel48 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Drama Romance Western Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for brief sexual content/full nudity. Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Jesse Plemons and Kirsten Dunst are a couple off-screen and have two sons together.

Connections Edited into Amanda the Jedi Show: Faster than your First Time Reviews 2 - Best and Worst of TIFF 2021 (2021) User reviews83 Review Top review 8/10 Benedict Cumberbatch is superb!! This is not a movie to everyone. You can't overlook any single detail in this movie, it's like a puzzle. You will need to capture the next scene to have the whole picture of the main character. Superb performance by Benedict Cumberbatch, he got the soul of Phil Burbank, including the roughness, repressive and repulsive behaviour of his character. helpful•26 23 li0904426 Sep 13, 2021 FAQ2 Wonder who will play his brother George? Described in the book as short and stocky. Hmmm casting? Does this production bare any relation to Don Winslow's novel of the same name?
