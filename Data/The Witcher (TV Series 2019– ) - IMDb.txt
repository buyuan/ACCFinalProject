It is based on the book series of the same name by Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski. The Witcher follows the story of Geralt of Rivia, a solitary monster hunter, who struggles to find his place in a world where people often prove more wicked than monsters and beasts. But when destiny hurtles him toward a powerful sorceress, and a young princess with a special gift, the three must learn to navigate independently the increasingly volatile Continent. —aaltaiawy violencemagicmonster hunterwarrior queenman in leather clothes110 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines The worst monsters are the ones we create. Genres Action Adventure Fantasy Mystery Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Henry Cavill himself actively pursued the role of Geralt until he got it. When Cavill first heard that the show was being made, he repeatedly bothered his agents to get a meeting with Netflix. Finally, Netflix agreed to take the meeting with him but show-runner Lauren Schmidt initially turned him down because she hadn't written a single word of the script yet and did not know what the show was going to be. After 4 months, as the show was being written, Schmidt tested 207 actors for Geralt but couldn't find him. She said that while writing the script, she kept hearing Cavill's voice in her head speaking Geralt's lines. Finally, 4 months after their initial meeting, she met Cavill again, and this time during his audition, when he read the lines she had written live in front of her in his real voice, she instantly knew that Cavill was Geralt. Cavill said it was important to go through the process to make sure the right actor was picked and he was thrilled to finally win the role which he called his "dream come true". He went to add "it was an absolute honor to play Geralt because he lives very close to my heart."

The one real issue i have with the show is that it doesn't do a great job of distinguishing between current and flashback scenes. helpful•2.1K 703 tovart30 Dec 23, 2019 FAQ6 Is 'The Witcher' based on the books or the video game? Will the show feature the same kind of content(mostly nudity, profanity. Violence doesn't concern me) as 'Game of Thrones'? Or will it be more tame? Why does Geralt carry only one sword on his back?
