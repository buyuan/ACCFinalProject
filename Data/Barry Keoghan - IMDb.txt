Personal Quote: Heroin came into Dublin, and it caught every family. My mother was one of the unlucky ones. She got caught on it, then she passed away... [He was subsequently raised by his grandmother.] She's a tough one... I'll come home off a film set where I'm getting pampered, and I'll get a slap in the head if I don't make my bed. That's what I love about her. Trivia: Born and raised in Dublin, Ireland.
