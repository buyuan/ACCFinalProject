Connections Featured in Making of: Apocalypse - La 2ème guerre mondiale (2009) User reviews29 Review Top review 7/10 pleasant, but not perfect It is a France 2 documentary and as such very french biased. Many french sensitive issues (Vichy.. only the top a disgrace, or whole french populations under Vichy a disgrace ?! ), liberation of France by active troops in terms of men, material..how much (or rather how little) was french, etc. are left under the carpet. All the world-war issues are looked upon with french interest/viewpoint..if there isn't one, then there is no attention to it or only as a 5 second footnote (Fights in Norway? Holland ? Belgium ? Convoy war at Atlantic ? Balkan fights Tito resistance, Soviet fights in Balkan countries ? MarketGarden ? Japan's fights and occupation in china,New Guinea,etc). However french issues which are marginal to the outside world are given broad attention (french ministers crisis 1940, negotiations Roosevelt with Gaulle en Vichy favoured representative in 1943, Bir Hakeim stand, LeClerc background (ahem Zjoekov's background ? Monty's Background? Alexander's background?), Indochine taken over by Japan, French resistance actions (no resistance elsewhere?), De Gaulle's return in France and focus on his political problems). Like before-mentioned text: Many films have been aired before..only a few are rare (from French sources). All are coloured in, which gives it a special touch-but not all are coloured in thoroughly (only face one colour, one colour for uniform, one colour for bushes, one colour for ground). It's nice to see, and it keeps you captivated...but it is not THE best documentary, and certainly not "neutral"(unbiased). helpful•34 25 djeezman Apr 7, 2010 Details Edit Release date September 8, 2009 (France) Country of origin France Official site Official site (France) Language French Also known as Apocalypse: World War II Production companies CC&C Clarke Costelle & Cie Établissement de Communication et de Production Audiovisuelle de la Défense (ECPAD) NHK See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 5 hours 12 minutes Related news Disney+ UK Star Launch: Complete List of New TV Shows and Films Feb 23Den of Geek Mediawan Sees Profits Double, Revenues Rise by 13% to $331 Million Apr 11Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Apocalypse: La 2ème guerre mondiale (2009) officially released in Canada in French?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
