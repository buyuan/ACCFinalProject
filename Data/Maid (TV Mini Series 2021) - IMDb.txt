Connections Featured in The Graham Norton Show: Andie MacDowell/Jodie Comer/Billy Porter/Daisy Haggard/Texas (2021) User reviews595 Review Top review 9/10 A journey worth taking This show is definitely worth watching. It's a real life journey. And a powerful one. Some critics complained that some of the decisions made by the main character are so terrible it's alienated them but if you watch this show, by the time you get to the 9th episode you will get it. I know, I did. It was only by the 8th and 9th episodes that I fully understood what Alex and women like her are going through. It's easy to judge but if you go through a horrible situation like that, you will make mistakes. It's impossible not to. I also liked how the show depicted the other characters. Each of them were dealing with their own set of problems. The writing and acting are very good. It's very realistic and powerful. I believe that if you take this journey, you won't regret it. By the time I finished binge watching the show I got an entirely new perspective on situations I thought I understood. Highly recommended! helpful•95 21 Just-A-Girl-14 Oct 8, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 1, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Official Netflix Language English Also known as 女佣浮生录 Filming locations Saanich, British Columbia, Canada Production companies John Wells Productions John Wells Productions LuckyChap Entertainment See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 9 hours 5 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Related news ‘Narcos: Mexico’ & ‘Squid Game’ Top Netflix’s First Weekly TV Streaming Top Ten Chart Nov 16Deadline Film + TV Andie MacDowell Sets ‘My Happy Ending’ Nov 16Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What was the official certification given to Maid (2021) in Japan?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
