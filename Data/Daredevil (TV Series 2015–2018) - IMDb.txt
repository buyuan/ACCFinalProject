Instead of limiting him it gave him superhuman senses that enabled him to see the world in a unique and powerful way. Now he uses these powers to deliver justice, not only as a lawyer in his own law firm, but also as vigilante at night, stalking the streets of Hell's Kitchen as Daredevil, the man without fear. —DDK vigilanteblind manmarvel comicsninjalawyer84 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines The man without fear Genres Action Crime Drama Fantasy Sci-Fi Thriller Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia It's mentioned that Matt grew up at St. Agnes' Orphanage. Skye from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (2013) also stated that she grew up at St. Agnes' orphanage. Goofs In season 2, Matt Murdock claims he has never been north of 116th street. Columbia Law School, which he attended, is north of 116th street. Quotes Frank Castle: You know you're one bad day away from being me. Crazy credits The opening credits is a montage of silhouettes emerging from a red background, in the manner of blood dripping over everything and revealing hidden objects. Connections Featured in Late Night with Seth Meyers: Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges/Charlie Cox/Dead Sara (2015) Soundtracks Main Title (uncredited) Composed by Braden Kimball and John Paesano User reviews1K Review Top review 8/10 Miller's Daredevil Brought To Life Those familiar with comics will know Frank Miller's run on Daredevil is up there with the highest points of his career. Other writers, such as Bendis and Brubaker, hit similar highs in their writing of the character. It's something about Daredevil that brings out incredible storytelling, whether it be the downtrodden and persevering Matt Murdock or the gritty realism of the setting in contrast to the colorful heroes that populate comic books, Daredevil has had a history of fantastic luck with having its potential tapped on paper. Now, that potential has been tapped on the screen. From the first episode you can tell the property has been adapted with love and a lot of hard work. The cinematography is beautiful in every frame. The characters could not have been cast better. If this weren't actually a better deal for fans, getting 13 hours of (excellent) content, I would hope Charlie Cox could front a Daredevil movie franchise. Because he could carry it. Daredevil has been the star of some of the best comics ever written, so the adaptation was always going to come under scrutiny. But how it holds up against them? This might actually be better. helpful•365 89 user-279-773711 Apr 10, 2015 FAQ5 Is this connected to the Marvel Cinematic Universe? How is this show's timeline intertwined with the MCU?
