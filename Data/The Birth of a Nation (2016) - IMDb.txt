Genres Biography Drama History Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for disturbing violent content, and some brief nudity Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The film was shot in 27 days. Goofs The accents used in the film are typical of the modern deep south, not of the Tidewater region of Virginia in the first half of the 19th century. Quotes Nat Turner: [after Nat watches a horrific scene between a slave and slave owner and has to preach to the slaves] Brethren, I pray you'll sing to the Lord, a new song. Sing praise in assembly of the righteous. Let the saints be joyful in glory, let them sing aloud on their beds. Let the high praise of God be on the mouths of the saints and a two-edged sword in their hand to execute vengeance on the demonic nations! And punishment on those peoples! To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fens of iron! To execute on them this written judgement! This honor have all his saints! PRAISE THE LORD! PRAISE THE LORD! SING TO HIM A NEW SONG! PRAISE THE LORD! PRAISE THE LORD!

Hall, Sr. User reviews134 Review Top review 6/10 Easier to watch than 12 Years A Slave and one that is very much worth seeing, but nothing earth shattering either. "You got purpose, its in you." Nat Turner (Parker) is a different type of slave. He is literate and a preacher. He is treated better than most slaves and remains calm and obedient. When he begins to speak to other slaves around the south he notices mistreatment and worse. No longer able to stand by and do nothing he leads a slave revolt that ends up changing the country. Going in I was expecting "another brutal slave movie" along the lines of 12 Years A Slave. While it did not shy away from the horror of slavery it was more about the reasons that led up to the uprising and had more of a Free State Of Jones feel than 12 Years A Slave. That fact alone made this easier to watch. I'm not 100% sure how historically accurate the movie is but it is a movie that should be seen and understood. Things like this can happen and people can take a stand not based on how they are treated, but how they see others treated. That is an important lesson. Overall, easier to watch than 12 Years A Slave and one that is very much worth seeing, but nothing earth shattering either. I give this a B. helpful•12 10 cosmo_tiger Jan 10, 2017 FAQ1 Is this based on a true story?
