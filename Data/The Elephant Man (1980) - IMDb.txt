In actuality, the creature on display is indeed a man, twenty-one-year-old Joseph "John" Merrick, who has several physical deformities, including an oversized and disfigured skull, and an oversized and disfigured right shoulder. Brutish Bytes, his "owner", only wants whatever he can get economically by presenting Merrick as a freak. Treves manages to bring Merrick under his care at the hospital, not without several of its own obstacles, including being questioned by those in authority since Merrick cannot be cured. Treves initially believes Bytes' assertion that mute Merrick is an imbecile, but ultimately learns that Merrick can speak and is a well-read and articulate man. As news of Merrick hits the London newspapers, he becomes a celebrated curiosity amongst London's upper class, including with Mrs. Kendal, a famed actress. Despite treated much more humanely, the question becomes whether Treves' actions are a further exploitation of Merrick. And as Merrick becomes more famous, others try to get their two-cents worth from who still remains a curiosity and a freak to most, including to Bytes, who has since lost his meal ticket. —Huggo hospitaldignitydisabilityhuman exploitationexploitation90 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines An incredible but true story... probably this year's best film. Genres Biography Drama Certificate PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia This movie was executive produced by Mel Brooks, who was responsible for hiring writer and director David Lynch, and obtaining permission to film in black-and-white. He deliberately left his name off of the credits, as he knew that people would get the wrong idea about the movie if they saw his name on the movie, given his fame as a satirist. Goofs In the film, John Merrick befriends Dr. Treves before he is kidnapped and taken to Belgium. In real life, Joseph Merrick never met Dr. Frederick Treves until he was rescued by police from a train station in London as was shown in the film. Quotes John Merrick: I am not an elephant! I am not an animal! I am a human being! I am a man! Crazy credits Closing disclaimer: This has been based upon the true life story of John Merrick, known as The Elephant Man, and not upon the Broadway play of the same title or any other fictional account.

John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins are simple incredible, and this movie is just filled with unforgettable scenes.... but like some people have mentioned here before, it is an incredibly hard movie to watch, especially after you realize what a sweet, kind, smart and innocent man John Merrick was, it is often painful to watch the way he's treated by some people, and like Hopkins says after he sees him for the first time "I pray to god that he's an idiot", sadly, he is everything but that... 10/10, no question helpful•319 34 ofurkusa Aug 14, 2002 FAQ1 Did everything happen to Merrick just like in the film?
