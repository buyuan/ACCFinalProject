However, after several months, Charu and Amal's feelings for each other move beyond literary friendship. —Erik Gregersen <erik@astro.asutexas.edu> character name as titleforename as titlenewspaperliteratureloneliness20 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Genres Drama Romance Certificate Not Rated Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia Ray once called Charulata his favorite of his own films. Goofs when Bhupati shows Amal his weekly newspaper 'The Sentinel', it can be seen that it is published every Saturday and the date shown is 7 April 1879 but actually 7 April 1879 was Monday. Quotes Amal: All done with studies, exams, professors, cutting classes. Charulata: What's left? Foolishness and mischief? Amal: Poetry. Rhythm. You know, I was thinking. Charulata: What? Amal: All of life is like a rhythm. Birth, death. Day - night. Happiness - sorrow. Meeting - parting. Like the waves on the ocean, now rising - now falling. One complements the other.

CHARULATA was perhaps Ray's most technically stunning work, featuring an elegant - if moody - story shot in a manner that finds Ray experimenting a bit. The story is set in an upper-class, intellectual household in 1890s India, and the period setting is rendered in great detail  giving the film a lush, living beauty that (thanks to the stunning cinematography of Subrata Mitra) never crosses over into stuffiness. In a handful of scenes, a French new wave influence can also be seen  primarily at the very end, and also in an earlier scene featuring the title character's recollections (in a quick-moving montage) of childhood memories. Based on a story by Rabindranath Tagore, the film explores marital complacency, as Bhupati (a wealthy publisher and political idealist, devotes the majority of his time to his publishing business, and to political interests, and grows increasingly isolated from his wife, Charulata. Charulata  as an attractive upper-class wife, is essentially expected to manage the household, and not much else, and is increasingly both lonesome (Bhupati is a generally pleasant enough husband, though also a severe workaholic who is rarely around, and - in his sexual politics - he is a product of his time) and intellectually restless. In the midst of this, Bhupati's younger brother Amal arrives  Amal, a romantically inclined bohemian and recent college graduate who is searching for work while also pursuing literary ambitions, and has temporarily moved into the household. Amal and Charulata are instantly drawn to each other  first as intellectual companions, before an awareness of attraction is recognized. The two are plainly aware of the impossibility of the unrequited relationship, as Bhupati  after discovering than an employee has been embezzling form him  is then devastated to discover that his wife is turning away from him. To highlight the increasing distance between each of the three characters, CHARULATA is formalistic in it's look (with the handful of well-placed new-wave-inflected scenes adding textural complexity and emotionalism), with the classical touches of the cinematography underscoring the characters' ever-increasing distance from each other. Exploring sexual and class politics - with great depth and complexity - in a historical setting (while  in its' exploration of idealistic, nationalistic politics  making subtle connections to the present-day handling of the same issues in Bengali society), with flawless performances from all, CHARULATA is a beautiful and haunting masterpiece. helpful•26 2 davidals Feb 7, 2003 FAQ1 What's the significance of the ending?
