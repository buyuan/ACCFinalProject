I am all for slow burn and methodical set ups but so far this is nothing but a long hard slog. There are just too many character back stories to build up with which is by no means confusing but I just now have four story arcs spanning three episodes and zero care for any of them. It may not be so bad had the acting not been mediocre at best, or if everyone didn't already seem so bloody depressed. So far; it's poorly written with garbage dialogue, the pacing is all over the plane and there's no likeable characters, all of that's had me reaching for my phone to fill a good chunk of the 58 min running time. helpful•109 45 Edeards Oct 22, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 22, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Ray James Production companies Genre Films Platform One Media See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour Color Color Related news The Sinner's David Huynh Talks Cj's Embarrassing, Private but Vital Scene and a Whole Lot More!
