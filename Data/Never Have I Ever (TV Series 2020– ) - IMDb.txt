"When we were talking about the series--there are so many teenage series . . . about love and sex and all of that--and we were both really interested, because we had parents that died unexpectedly, in talking about grief and how grief manifests itself. And [Lang's] brother, after her parents got divorced, had about four months when his legs were paralyzed. And then, all of a sudden, they started working again. And they went to every doctor. They went to every psychologist. And it was this mysterious thing. . . . In researching it, this is something that happens to people, particularly young people, sometimes after trauma. So that was hard to resist as something to talk about. And after she spoke to her brother and got permission, we felt we wanted to use it in the series, because we thought it was a really fascinating physical manifestation of a teenager's grief." Connections Featured in The IMDb Show: Darren Barnet (2020) User reviews576 Review Top review 10/10 Binged it and loved it! Unexpectedly, I really loved this show! I didn't start it with high hopes, thinking it would just be another classic American cringey high school show with perfect blondes and hunky guys. But I was very pleasantly surprised! The show follows Devi, an Indian-American girl, which is an angle that I haven't seen on TV before. It was actually informative to me as I'd never really explored the culture before and I really connected with her whole family. I cringed with Devi, laughed with her and even cried with her. Normally, I don't write reviews for shows but I wanted to give this one a little reward for entertaining me and showing a refreshingly new angle. I thoroughly enjoyed the show and hope it will come back for more seasons! helpful•204 38 poppyemercer Apr 28, 2020 Details Edit Release date April 27, 2020 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Netflix Site Language English Also known as لم يسبق لي أبداً Filming locations Los Angeles, California, USA Production companies 3 Arts Entertainment Kaling International Netflix See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 30 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news Noah Centineo’s Netflix Spy Drama Adds Series Regulars and Guest Cast Nov 12Variety Film + TV Noah Centineo’s Netflix CIA Drama Series Sets Seven Series Regulars Nov 12Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
