Goofs At one point, Chris burns his Social Security card, just like he burned paper money previously. In real life, Chris didn't burn his Social Security Card. When his sister Carine flew to Alaska to pick up his remains and some of the possessions that were found with him, she did not receive his backpack. Years later, when she returned to Alaska to finally see the bus where Chris died, she met a man who had removed Chris's backpack from the bus shortly after he had died. The man kept the backpack at his home for years, and when he finally gave it back to Carine, she found that it still contained many of Chris's possessions, including his wallet and Social Security card. Quotes Christopher McCandless: [written into book] Happiness only real when shared. Crazy credits The opening title is shown as part of Chris's journal's writings. Connections Featured in Siskel & Ebert & the Movies: The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford/King of California/Good Luck Chuck/Into the Wild/Sydney White (2007) Soundtracks Hard Sun Written by Gordon Peterson Performed by Eddie Vedder & Corin Tucker Courtesy of Monkeywrench, Inc./J Records User reviews1K Review Top review A masterpiece Sean Penn's artistic contribution to cinema in my lifetime has been staggering. The films he's directed have included some of my favourite performances from amazing actors pushed to their absolute limit. I feel like everything he's ever done in his career so far, every tiny nuance, has been distilled into this incredible film. From start to finish it is beyond inspiring - by the end, it lifts right off the ground. The first time the soundtrack really kicked in, I felt that Eddie Vedder's score seemed too loud. Then I realized that my only complaint was merely me resisting the full experience. The whole point of it all was to let go and not be afraid of going that one step too far. helpful•235 188 charlesjohnston2002 Sep 10, 2007 FAQ4 Is 'Into the Wild' based on a book?
