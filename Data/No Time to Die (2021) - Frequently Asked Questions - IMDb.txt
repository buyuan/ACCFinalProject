This is the 25th film in the James Bond series. This isn't the actual title, the film is being known as "Bond 25" until the title is revealed (much like how Casino Royale was known as "Bond 21" and Quantum of Solace was known as "Bond 22" The actual title of the movie is "No Time To Die" Edit What new gadgets are shown in the trailer? Answer What is the body count in this film? Answer Spoilers Edit The FAQ items below may give away important plot points. Just wondering who Primo is working for at the start of the movie, when Bond visits the grave of Vesper. There is a card from Spectre, and Blofeld said he planned it. Was he working for Spectre then, and 5 years on he is working for Safin? He was working for Spectre and Blofeld and thought that Heracles would kill James in Cuba. Toward the end Bond makes reference to him switching to Safin's team after he murdered his old boss (Blofeld). Edit Why is Safin's face disfigured, and how was he still alive when Madeleine shot him in the beginning of the film? Blofeld/Spectre tried to kill his family with some Dioxin poison. He succeeded in killing all but Safin. Dioxins can cause facial disfiguration, as was famously the case with former Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko. When Madeleine shot Safin he was probably wearing a bullet-proof vest. Edit Why didnt Safin poison Bond at the same time he was poisoning all the members of Spectre? He had Madeleine ready to poison Blofeld already so he was not really needed for that. He had nothing against Bond, he wanted revenge on Spectre for killing his family. Edit So is Bond actually Mathilde's father or not? Yes. Madeleine initially said no to spite James for not trusting her and abandoning her for the last five years. In his final moments, she does confirm that it's his daughter, although James was already certain.
