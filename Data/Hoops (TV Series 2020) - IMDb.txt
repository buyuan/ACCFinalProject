(2020) User reviews205 Review Top review 7/10 it's good but not great, needs more Basketball!! This TV show might have the most unlikeable main actor, well that's the point. Some people say the language is too vulgar, yeah it is true but nothing you haven't seen before. I do think that the story had some really good potential but didn't live up to the expectations quite well. Anyway I'll be waiting for next season, this needs more basketball. helpful•28 23 fnpatino Aug 22, 2020 Details Edit Release date August 21, 2020 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Official site Language English Also known as Một Rổ Khẩu Nghiệp Production companies Bento Box Entertainment Pepper Hill Productions Walcott Company See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 25 minutes Color Color Related news Netflix Rolls Out Dedicated Tab For Mobile Games In Android App Nov 2Tubefilter.com Netflix’s Gaming Section Launches Globally With ‘Stranger Things’ Titles Nov 2The Hollywood Reporter - Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
