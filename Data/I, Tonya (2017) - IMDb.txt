Despite ultimately garnering some success in figure skating being national champion, a world championship medalist, an Olympian, and being the first American woman to complete a Triple Axel in competition, she is arguably best known for her association to "the incident": the leg bashing on January 6, 1994 of her competitor, Nancy Kerrigan, who, unlike Tonya, was everything that the figure-skating community wanted in their representatives. Her association to that incident led to Tonya being banned from competitive figure skating for life. Tonya's story from the beginning of her figure-skating life at age four to the aftermath of the incident is presented. Besides Tonya herself, key people in her life give their perspective of their role in her life. Although they may agree on the broad issues at hand, such as that the incident did occur, they may vary widely in their recollection of the details. These people are: her waitress mother Lavona Golden, who despite having paid for her expensive figure-skating lessons, was abusive toward her physically and emotionally, never believing she being good enough in any aspect of the word, and who pulled her from school to focus solely on the figure skating; Diane Rawlinson, her first and longest serving coach, who, for good or bad, largely let Tonya be Tonya in the way she presented herself to the figure skating world; Jeff Gillooly, her first husband, the two who also had a turbulent relationship on a need to be loved perhaps without truly loving the other; Jeff's friend and Tonya's bodyguard Shawn Eckardt, a dim bulb who believed himself to be a bigger player in the big scheme of life than he actually was; and sports journalist Martin Maddox, a fictional character who provides general commentary of what the sports media as a collective wanted out of Tonya and the incident. —Huggo ice skatingviolenceabusefemale protagonistice skater226 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines There's no need to have class when you have talent. Genres Biography Comedy Drama Sport Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for pervasive language, violence, and some sexual content/nudity Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Although Margot Robbie trained extensively for the role, she was not able to perform a triple axel, nor could a skating double be found to do so, as very few women figure skaters are able to perform the jump. Producer Tom Ackerley stated, "There have been only six women since Tonya Harding who have done a triple axel; even if there was one who was doing it today, she'd be training for the Olympics and couldn't risk doing it for the film." The jump was accomplished with the use of visual effects. Goofs When Tonya Harding competed, song lyrics were not allowed in competition the way they are today. Although she included "Sleeping Bag" by ZZ Top in the third section of her 1991-1992 program, it was the music only. Quotes Tonya Harding: There's no such thing as truth. It's bullshit. Everyone has their own truth, and life just does whatever the fuck it wants. Crazy credits At the beginning of the ending crawl, actual interview footage of Lavona Golden, Shawn Eckardt, Jeff Gillooly, and Tonya Harding is shown that mirrors some of the recreated interviews shown in the film.

User reviews537 Review Top review 8/10 Relevant movie Why relevant? Until I saw this movie, in my point of view Tonya Harding was a cheat and a lowlife and this was entirely based on the media coverage of the events in 1994. Having seen the movie I feel ashamed about how easily I judged her and I realised I have to be way more careful in forming my opinion about people. helpful•441 57 inikim Jan 2, 2018 Details Edit Release date January 5, 2018 (Canada) Countries of origin United States United Kingdom Australia Canada Official sites Official Facebook Official Instagram Language English Also known as 我，花样女王 Filming locations Macon Centreplex, Macon, Georgia, USA Production companies AI-Film Clubhouse Pictures (II) Georgia Film, Music & Digital Entertainment Office See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $11,000,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $30,014,539 Opening weekend US & Canada $264,155 Dec 10, 2017 Gross worldwide $53,939,297 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 59 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Atmos Aspect ratio 2.39 : 1 Related news Mckenna Grace To Headline & EP ‘The Bad Seed’ Sequel Greenlighted By Lifetime Which She Co-Wrote Nov 12Deadline Film + TV More ‘Help’ at the Oscars? 6 actresses from the 2011 hit are in the running Nov 12Gold Derby Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Hindi language plot outline for I, Tonya (2017)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
