Edgar 5.7 Don's Plum 7.1 Body of Lies 7.3 This Boy's Life Storyline Edit Garland's novel centers on a young nicotine-addicted traveler named Richard, an avid pop-culture buff with a particular love for video games and Vietnam War movies. While at a hotel in Bangkok, he finds a map left by his strange, whacked-out neighbor, who just committed suicide. The map supposedly leads to a legendary island paradise where some other wayward souls have settled. —Mike Arndt <clayton@hooked.net> thailandparadisetravelbeachisland156 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Paradise has its price Genres Adventure Drama Romance Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for violence, some strong sexuality, language and drug content Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Leonardo DiCaprio was paid $20 million for the film, the result of the immense success of Titanic (1997). DiCaprio had originally planned to play the lead character in American Psycho (2000), but when his salary demand proved too much, that deal broke down and he agreed to make The Beach. Goofs In the burial scene, the corpse blinks while the sand falls on his eyes. Quotes Richard: And me? I still believe in paradise. But now at least I know it's not some place you can look for. Because it's not where you go. It's how you feel for a moment in your life when you're a part of something. And if you find that moment... It lasts forever.

User reviews621 Review Top review 8/10 Why did it get such bad reviews here? This is one of the few times that I have been badly mislead by the reviews on IMDb! I avoided this film in the past because of this, but thought it would be a good "soft" film to watch on video with with a friend and his wife (she doesn't like difficult films). What a revelation! I understand that people who have read the book may be disappointed, but as an uneducated viewer this is a fantastic film! Novel situation, novel location (beautiful images, even though the beach was re-modeled), novel plot, novel characters (all of whom are wildly different yet possible to sympathise with - except maybe for Bugs)... this film has everything in it that I find so desperately lacking in the average Hollywood pulp I'm forced to watch with friends. And I *liked* the fact that the film made a few surprising changes in style... I hate knowing the end of a story at least an hour before it finally grinds its inevitable way there (see any "action" film). helpful•22 7 MossMan Dec 4, 2001 FAQ3 How does this film differ from the novel? Why does Daffy go crazy and why doesn't he go back to the beach?
