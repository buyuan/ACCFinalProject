User reviews212 Review Top review 8/10 A Big Surprise I went into this one without even bothering to read the reviews and it blew me away. Extremely well done, the acting from all involved was top notch, especially Tim Blake Nelson, who really showed he is a quality actor. There is nothing over the top involved the story is just a story with the "good guys" coming out on top against the odds. Except who really knows who the good guys are. Definitely a movie that could be watched more than once. It loses 2 stars for me due to the flashbacks, those were not really required and made the movie a bit confusing. 8/10 and highly recommended. helpful•46 16 nowego Oct 9, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 1, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Languages English Spanish Also known as Старий Генрі Production companies Hideout Pictures Shout!
