Its crew (of tiny, intelligent, and unemotional beings) is looking for an orb sent from its planet to extract the oceans' salt, which will ruin Earth. The orb is in the possession of Josh, the fifth-grade son of a single mom whose car strikes the ambulatory alien spaceship and cripples its power supply. The crew has 48 hours to recover the orb, throw it in the Atlantic, and leave Earth. Over the course of two days, the ship's crew experiences chaos and emotion in New York. Do Earth's giants - Josh and his mom - have anything to teach these brainy aliens? Meanwhile, mutiny is afoot and the cops are closing in. —<jhailey@hotmail.com> movie flopfrogpet frogfrog croakingfbi federal bureau of investigation116 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Eddie Murphy in Eddie Murphy in Meet Dave Genres Adventure Comedy Family Romance Sci-Fi Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG for bawdy and suggestive humor, action and some language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia To promote the movie, the studio put a big makeshiftp Eddie Murphy head on a trailer to tour the US.

Contains some good acting by Murphy and Banks but otherwise the acting is subpar and the humour is rather disappointing. However mildly entertaining this film is, you got to start wondering if the studios have just ran out of ideas, as this film is the latest in a trend of modern, predictable movies. Not to say this movie is bad. It is entertaining and will give you a few smiles, perhaps a chuckle or two, and is worth watching, but don't enter the cinema expecting something magnificent. The plot is disappointing, the humour is okay, the acting is good, so in the end this movie gets an overall average mark 5/10. http://www.gemizo.net helpful•44 56 gemizok Jul 5, 2008 FAQ2 Is 'Meet Dave' based on a book?
