The series tells the saga of Ragnar's band of Viking brothers and his family as he rises to become King of the Viking tribes. As well as being a fearless warrior, Ragnar embodies the Norse traditions of devotion to the gods: legend has it that he was a direct descendant of Odin, the god of war and warriors. —History Channel sex scenekingherosword and shieldviking47 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines The Storm Is Coming Genres Action Adventure Drama History Romance War Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The Norse people did not actually refer to themselves as Vikings as an ethnic or national identity. Viking was a profession and was the term for the act of raiding across the sea or a person participating in such an activity. Goofs In history, Norsemen dressed more extravagantly and possibly notably more sexually provocatively than portrayed in the show. They dressed in bright colors, bathed weekly and used primitive hair-dyes and even came off as vain to some Christians. Quotes Floki: Who needs a reason for betrayal? One must always think the worst Ragnar, even of your own kin. That way, you avoid too much disappointment in life. Alternate versions In the U.S. all episodes were censored for violence, nudity, profanity, and time restrains for their broadcast on the History Channel. However, the uncensored versions of the episodes can be found on the U.S. Blu-rays. Each episode is presented as an "Original Version" (censored) or "Extended Version" (uncensored).
