Its visionary owners George and Oscar Marienthal smashed color and gender barriers to put unknown, controversial voices on stage and transform entertainment, as America knew it in the '50s, '60s, and '70s. Now, with the club long gone, and its star talent reaching its golden years, George's son David and director/screenwriter, Theodore Bogosian, go on a quest to collect the memories of the clubs before they are lost. Celebrity interviews now include Bob Newhart, the Smothers Brothers, Dick Gregory, Lainie Kazan, Herbie Hancock, Dick Cavett, Tim Reid, Fred Willard and Ramsey Lewis. The film portrays through interviews, live footage, photos, music, and song, the most beloved and famous talent of our time at the decisive moments when they showed up, dug deep, and broke in. How do you change the world with a laugh and a song? Find out in a film that documents the rise and fall of one of American entertainment's great proving grounds. singerentertainmentvoice over narrationnightclubmusician4 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genre Documentary Parents guide Add content advisory User reviews Be the first to review Details Edit Release date May 27, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Official Site Language English Production company Happy Medium Ventures See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 23 minutes Color Color Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Live at Mister Kelly's (2021) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads Â© 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
