Personal Quote: [on Jay Leno] Leno was so great when he was a guest on Letterman. Great, great. I just think he's worked it too hard. I think he turned comedy into factory work -- and it comes across. It's just amazing how insecure he is. See more » Trivia: Along with fellow actor/comedian Adam Carolla and Daniel Kellison, he manages his own production company, Jackhole Industries. It usually backs most of the projects that he is involved with.
