Beginning in 1880, Part I follows Jonathan Joestar as he matures with and eventually combats his adoptive brother, the cunning, merciless Dio Brando. Set in 1938, Part II follows the misadventures of Joseph Joestar, grandson of Jonathan, as he masters the Ripple in order to combat hostile, ancient super-beings named the Pillar Men; creators of the Stone Mask. Part III follows Jotaro Kujo and his group as they journey from Tokyo to Cairo to save his mother's life by defeating his family's resurrected archenemy, Dio. In Part IV, an Arrow manifesting latent Stand abilities travels throughout Morioh, Japan in 1999; as high-schooler Josuke Higashikata (illegitimate son of Joseph) and friends seek out the culprit of a series of decade-long homicides. Set in 2001, Part V follows Giorno Giovanna, son of Dio, and his ambition to rise within the Neapolitan mafia by subverting its most powerful gang: Passione. based on mangaviolencegorehomoeroticismshounen25 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Animation Action Adventure Comedy Drama Fantasy Horror Thriller Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Hirohiko Araki is a big fan of Western music, and many of the characters and Stands in the show are named after musicians and songs. Quotes [repeated line] Dio Brando: [activates his Stand] Za Warudo! Crazy credits At the start of the "Phantom Blood" opening credits (Sono Chi No Sadame), the series title appears with a quick montage of all the JoJo heroes (Jolyne, Giorno, Josuke, Jotaro, Joseph, Jonathan) in manga comic pages flipping together, representing the Joestar family and the saga starting with the first JoJo.

JoJo is one of the weirdest and most entertaining anime's out there, and yet there's an emotional core to it. When people always talk about JoJo's Bizarre Adventure they always just talk about the memes or the great openings or the "Enemy stando!", but there's so much more to why people (including myself) love JoJo. Yes the memes and ridiculousness of JoJo is a ton of fun and certainly gives it the personality it's now become infamous for, but there is some truly incredible writing and characters in here. Plus because of the way the parts are laid out each one is unique and different, so if you didn't like the previous part then you'll probably like the next, then again literally every part is good except maybe the first. And the animation and music by David production is all fantastic. helpful•54 7 eberthume May 18, 2019 Details Edit Release date October 5, 2012 (Japan) Country of origin Japan Official sites Official Netflix Official site (Japan) Language Japanese Also known as JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Filming locations Tokyo, Japan Production companies David Production Lucky Land Communications Medicos Entertainment See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 30 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Related news ‘Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure Stone Ocean’ Trailer: Netflix Lands the Next Season of the Anime Hit Aug 10Slash Film 10 JoJo's Cosplays That Look Straight Out Of The Anime May 8ScreenRant.com Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
