See more » Trivia: When Johnson debuted in WWE as Rocky Maivia in 1996, he wasn't exactly a fan favorite. Despite being played as a hero, fans booed him relentlessly and chanted "Rocky sucks" every time he had a match. He later told Oprah Winfrey those negative chants made him transform into the egotistical character, The Rock, which, ironically made him a fan favorite.
