Personal Quote: [on leaving Saturday Night Live (1975)] It has been portrayed over the years as there being "lucrative deals" awaiting me in Hollywood. But if you look at the record, I didn't make a movie for two or three years. There were no lucrative deals awaiting me. I left because I was in love with a girl in L.A. I missed it very much. I should have hung around for years. And I feel bad about it now. See more » Trivia: He was considered for the role of Dr. Leo Marvin in What About Bob? (1991), which went to Richard Dreyfuss.
