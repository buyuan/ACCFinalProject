Connections Followed by Mike Hammer (1984) User reviews3 Review Top review 5/10 Saving a friend This full length Mike Hammer mystery has Stacy Keach at his tough guy best saving a friend who happens to be a detective who from what I could tell was there quite coincidentally at the scene of a high stakes poker game that is robbed and two men killed. Nevertheless Don Stroud who is also shot in the back gets himself indicted. It throws the film off kilter. Still Keach is great in the part and other performances to watch for are Verna Bloom as Hammer's secretary, Robyn Douglass as an undercover fed, Tim McIntire as a country singer and Richard Romanus as a federal witness who's not quite kosher. Still the script could have used some fine tuning. helpful•0 0 bkoganbing Nov 19, 2020 Details Edit Release date January 26, 1984 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Mike Hammer - Ein Mord ist nicht genug Filming locations Culver City, California, USA Production companies Jay Bernstein Productions Columbia Pictures Television See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 36 minutes Sound mix Mono Aspect ratio 1.33 : 1 Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
