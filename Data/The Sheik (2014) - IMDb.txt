At age 72, the Sheik has embraced an unlikely new career as an outlandish social media sensation; known for hilarious outbursts and massively popular antics. Watch as we recount the Sheik's one-of-a-kind life journey. The film explores the Sheik's personal relationships with those closest to him, and those who know him best: his wife, his children, his grandchildren, his contemporaries and colleagues. Interviews were conducted with the Sheik's family, Wrestling and Iranian historians, friends and over 25 wrestling superstars. —Jake Neiman iraniansheikprofessional wrestlingreference to youtubereference to twitter6 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines The amazingly entertaining story of a man that lived the American Dream by assuming the persona of the supreme villain.

Connections References WrestleMania (1985) User reviews7 Review Top review 3/10 A Limp Pass at a Spirited Story, The Sheik's Lack of Focus is Damning A quick-hits personal history of the mighty Iron Sheik, retired WWF champion turned profane social media phenomenon. Beneath his tough, big-front attitude, the Sheik has a deeply involved, complex story to tell, though an irritating lack of focus stops us from dwelling long enough to appreciate it. The film, well-produced and stuffed with big-name testimonials, seems more interested in his recent, superficial, second limelight than in his roots as an Iranian Olympian or even as foil to the likes of Hulk Hogan and Bob Backlund. Which is a shame, because I found the story of his abrupt exodus from the middle east and roundabout path to pro wrestling superstardom far, far more intriguing than his Twitter routine or appearances on Howard Stern. Maybe a lack of available footage from the Sheik's heyday is to blame, or maybe the producers found themselves too involved (they double as his social media advisors). Whatever the reasons, they leave the story hamstrung early and it sags badly for the last half-hour. Occasionally amusing and only rarely enlightening, it isn't half as enjoyable as just reading the guy's Wikipedia entry, checking out his last dozen tweets and calling it a day. helpful•4 6 drqshadow-reviews Dec 8, 2015 Details Edit Release date April 26, 2014 (Canada) Country of origin Canada Official sites Official site (Japan) The Official Webpage of The Iron Sheiks New Film, THE SHEIK!
