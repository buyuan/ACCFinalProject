The French foreign legion has left Vietnam in defeat and has something to prove. The Algerians are seeking independence. The two clash. The torture used by the French is contrasted with the Algerian's use of bombs in soda shops. A look at war as a nasty thing that harms and sullies everyone who participates in it. —John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> battle of algierstorturealgeriaresistancestruggle for independence435 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines The French Colonel...who was forced even to torture! One of the many women...who stopped at nothing to win! The Algerian Street Boy...who became a rebel hero! Genres Drama War Certificate Not Rated Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia One of the few films in Oscar history to be a nominee in two separate non-consecutive years. It was a foreign film nominee for 1966, and then a nominee for screenplay and direction for 1968. Goofs In the final scenes of the film, showing the mass street protests, the French police are backed up by armored vehicles that are, in fact, Soviet-made SU-100 tank destroyers. These were part of the Algerian military when the film was made in 1966 after independence, but would not have been present or used by the French at any time. Quotes Ben M'Hidi: It's hard to start a revolution. Even harder to continue it. And hardest of all to win it. But, it's only afterwards, when we have won, that the true difficulties begin. In short, Ali, there's still much to do.

You will struggle to find a better argument to dissuade budding and existing occupiers of territory they have no legitimate claim to embarking on, or continuing with their despotic occupations of populations and their lands. The people of Algiers demonstrate as determined a will to overthrow their oppressors as their oppressors had demonstrated just over a decade previously in their fight to regain their freedom from tyranny. It is however, the gripping presentation of a reality into a thoroughly convincing and believable portrayal of that reality that grabs the audiences attention, giving it longevity, linking it to future conflicts, keeping it relevant. It leaves you questioning what you would have done under the same or similar circumstance, while juggling the difference in semantics between freedom fighter and terrorist and considering the situational similarities that currently exist in the world today. helpful•15 6 Xstal Oct 27, 2020 FAQ3 Is this movie based on a novel?
