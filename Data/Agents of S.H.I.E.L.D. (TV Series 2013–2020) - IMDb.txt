It now knows not only about the Avengers, but also the powerful menaces that require those superheroes and more to face them. In response, Phil Coulson of the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division assembles an elite covert team to find and deal with these threats wherever they are found. With a world rapidly becoming more bizarre and dangerous than ever before as the supervillains arise, these agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. are ready to take them on. —Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) marvel cinematic universes.h.i.e.l.d.computer hackersecret government organizationmarvel comics31 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Not all heroes are super. (season 1) Genres Action Adventure Drama Sci-Fi Thriller Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The series shows that Phil Coulson's personal car, Lola, can fly. In the S.H.I.E.L.D. comics, flying cars supplied by Stark Industries have been standard vehicles for the organization since 1967. Goofs Colonel Talbot switches from wearing Command Pilot Wings to wearing a Master Security Forces badge (the Air Force's military police) on his fatigue uniform. These are two completely different career fields. Quotes Maria Hill: What does S.H.I.E.L.D. stand for, Agent Ward? Grant Ward: Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division. Maria Hill: And what does that mean to you? Grant Ward: It means someone really wanted our initials to spell out "S.H.I.E.L.D." It means we're the line between the world and the much weirder world. We protect people from news they aren't ready to hear. And when we can't do that, we keep them safe. Connections Featured in Marvel Studios: Assembling a Universe (2014) User reviews610 Review Top review 8/10 Definitely Gaining Momentum I have to admit that I was less than thrilled with this show's beginning. I didn't think the characters were well defined and the plot seemed very lackluster. I did continue to watch, though, and I am glad that I did. Each week, the characters are developing and the chemistry between the actors is getting better. The writing and the quick witted dialog are classic Joss. It just took some time to work out the kinks. The story lines are getting tighter as the show goes on. Also, as each character develops, there are questions raised that keep me coming back each week for answers. I'm glad that I stuck with this show and gave it a chance. It is turning out to be a great ensemble action show that I hope will last a long time. helpful•293 50 nannyjo Dec 3, 2013 FAQ7 How does the show line up with the movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe?
