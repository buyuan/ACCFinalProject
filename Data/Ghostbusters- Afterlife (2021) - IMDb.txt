Genres Adventure Comedy Fantasy Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for supernatural action and some suggestive references Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Finn Wolfhard did not know he was auditioning for Ghostbusters as the audition sides were purposefully kept to be generic and vague as the movie was being developed under secrecy. Quotes Trevor's classmate: What are you doing here in Summerville? Trevor: Honestly, my mom won't say it, but we're completely broke. And the only thing that's left in our name is this creepy old farmhouse my grandfather left us in the middle of nowhere. Connections Featured in AniMat's Crazy Cartoon Cast: The Bells of Disney Reboots (2019) User reviews10 Review Top review 10/10 As good as possible Face it, a follow up as good as the '84 movie is impossible. Even the sequel Ghostbusters 2 was not up to the task. But Afterlife is as close as it gets. Perfect casting with some amazing performances by the up and coming young talents present in the movie. Good storytelling, action sequences, humor, and the score based on Elmer Bernstein is fantastic. That's why in my opinion the movie is worth a 10, I can't imagine a better follow up then this. helpful•13 8 qptfkrwm Nov 13, 2021 FAQ4 Will this be a sequel to the 2016 'Ghostbusters' film?
