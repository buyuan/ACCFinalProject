Keller Dover is facing every parent's worst nightmare. His six-year-old daughter, Anna, is missing, together with her young friend, Joy, and as minutes turn to hours, panic sets in. The only lead is a dilapidated RV that had earlier been parked on their street. Heading the investigation, Detective Loki arrests its driver, Alex Jones, but a lack of evidence forces his release. As the police pursue multiple leads and pressure mounts, knowing his child's life is at stake the frantic Dover decides he has no choice but to take matters into his own hands. But just how far will this desperate father go to protect his family? —Warner Bros. Pictures child abductionpolicevigilante justicechild kidnappingwhistle285 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Every moment matters Genres Crime Drama Mystery Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for disturbing violent content including torture, and language throughout Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Jake Gyllenhaal and Denis Villeneuve had such a great time doing Enemy (2013) that Villeneuve cast him for this movie without any audition. Goofs Detective Loki works for a municipal police department in Pennsylvania yet all of the police cars with lights activated have only blue lights. Blue lights in Pennsylvania are "courtesy lights" for volunteer firefighters/EMS personnel private vehicles. They are not emergency lights with any traffic control powers. Police use either a combination of red and blue or, if using a single light, red only. Quotes Keller Dover: Pray for the best, but prepare for the worst. Connections Featured in The Tonight Show with Jay Leno: Episode #21.212 (2013) Soundtracks Put Your Hand In The Hand Written by Gene MacLellan Performed by Ocean Courtesy of Buddah Records By arrangement with Sony Licensing User reviews1K Review Top review 9/10 Spellbinding Prisoners is extremely suspenseful and equally disturbing. Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, whose last film was the equally spellbinding and disturbing Incendies, builds up the tension from the first frame and does not let up for the full 153 minutes of the movie. Aaron Guzikowski's script, though on the surface a child kidnapping thriller, bucks all Hollywood trends and, as well as being a taut thriller, poses serious moral issues. It also helps that the film has a first rate cast doing outstanding work: Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, Terence Howard, Melissa Leo, Maria Bello and Viola Davis. Prisoners is not for the faint heated but is likely to feature strongly at next year's Oscars. helpful•152 67 corrosion-2 Sep 20, 2013 FAQ4 What is the song playing in the van?
