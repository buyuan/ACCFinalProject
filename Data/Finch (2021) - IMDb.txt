The premise was not the most original one, as we have seen elements of it in previous films. I think this is a film that again suffers a little bit from its marketing and the expectations it arises. If you expect an action loaded film like "I, Robot" you will be disappointed. This is rather a melancholic story about a dying man and his dog who creates a robot as a caretaker. Its a film about life, loss and moving forward. It does have some action and tense elements that are typical for a SciFi adventure, and it does have fantastic visual effects and a beautiful cinematography. But the core of it is the characters (including the dog, which has its own character) by which the film is driven. Its truly another one man show on Tom Hanks' resume and he has more than once proven that he is great at that. This is no difference. Tom Hanks gives a very touching performance. Its not constantly brilliant as he sometimes sleepwalks a bit through it, but in its essence very good. I also liked he dynamic between the three characters which was nicely done. Good film, not legendary, not a 100% must see but a good way to pass 2 hours with. helpful•69 43 Alexander_Blanchett Nov 5, 2021 Details Edit Release date November 5, 2021 (United Kingdom) Countries of origin United Kingdom United States Language English Also known as BIOS Filming locations New Mexico, USA Production companies Amblin Partners Dutch Angle ImageMovers See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 55 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 2.39 : 1 Related news ‘Finch’ Took Tom Hanks Into The Great Outdoors Nov 11HollywoodOutbreak.com How ‘Finch’s’ Visual Effects Team Combined Practical Elements to Build Tom Hanks’ Droid Nov 11Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
