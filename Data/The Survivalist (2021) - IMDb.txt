Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines An ordinary guy with an extraordinary arsenal Genres Action Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for violence and language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia All entries contain spoilers User reviews36 Review Top review 4/10 Zombie movie without zombies The Survivalist is another generic post-apocalypse movie with all the standard disease/zombie tropes (with COVID instead of zombies). There's even a girl who is allegedly the key to cure everyone. The idea, I guess, was to throw in a few high-tier actors, mainly Rhys Meyers and Malkovich, and make them play out a highly emotional drama about human determination, weakness and self-sacrifice. At some points it works. But mostly it doesn't. Emotional moments look either hysterical or indifferent. And it's not the actors' fault. Also, why do people in this movie shoot endlessly without aiming when they are SO low on ammo? helpful•5 1 zalessky Oct 7, 2021 FAQ1 Where was this movie filmed ?
