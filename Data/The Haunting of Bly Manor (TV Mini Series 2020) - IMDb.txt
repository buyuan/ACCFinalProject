A movie remake telling a modern version of the tale called The Turning (2020) was released in theaters a few months before this series premiered. Goofs Bly Manor has North American early 20th century push button light switches and sockets throughout the building despite being set somewhere in Essex, England. Buildings electrified in early 20th century England would have had toggle switches and round two pin sockets. By the 1980s, when the series is set, there would have been modern UK sockets and switches if the building had ever been rewired. Henry's office and Peter's flat have the correct UK switches.

While Bly left me looking forward to the next installment, it also left me longing for something Hill House delivered that fell short here. Still a great watch.... it's just not the complete masterpiece The Haunting of Hill House is. helpful•71 58 mcooknoe Oct 10, 2020 FAQ3 Is this an adaptation of The Turn of the Screw, by Henry James?
