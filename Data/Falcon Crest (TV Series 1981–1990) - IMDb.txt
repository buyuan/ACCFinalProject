When the show first premiered, creator Earl Hamner, Jr. stated that he did not want the show to become another soap opera like Dallas (1978), however, by its second season, that is exactly what the show became. Goofs When Richard Channing takes control of his fathers newspaper he renames it The New San Francisco Globe. Throughout season 2 some establishing shots of the exterior of the building still show the original "The San Francisco Globe" sign. Quotes Richard Channing Denault: If you're going to shoot... shoot, but don't talk me to death. Connections Featured in En himla många program (1989) User reviews21 Review Top review A solid, classic soap opera Set in the fictional Tuscany Valley of California, Falcon Crest focused on a large family of wealthy vinyardists, who were either bickering with each other, plotting against each other, and occasionally swapping mates. Legendary film star Jane Wyman played the ambitious matriarch Angela Channing, constantly at loggerheads with her nephew Chase Gioberti (Robert Foxworth), an airline pilot (and ex-Vietnam vet) who returned to Falcon Crest to claim his inheritance following his father's mysterious death. Others in the FC's large cast included Chase's long-suffering wife Maggie (Susan Sullivan), their children Cole (Billy Moses) and Vickie (Jamie Rose, Dana Sparks); Angela's children Emma (Margaret Ladd) and Julia (Abby Dalton), Abby's irresponsible son Lance (Lorenzo Lamas), who married the conniving Melissa (Ana-Alicia), when she was pregnant with Cole's child. A solid soap during its first season, FC got a major boast with the arrival of nefarious Richard Channing (David Selby), who turned out to be related to the Giobertis and would stop at nothing to get his share of Falcon Crest. The first 5-6 seasons of Falcon Crest remain among the best television has ever offered, with terrific acting, strong storylines, suspenseful and unforgettable cliffhangers, and a wonderfully dry wit. Currently, SoapNet runs episodes 3 times daily, Mon-Fri; try to see it if you can, Falcon Crest is an absolute must. helpful•13 1 jojofla Jan 5, 2001 Details Edit Release date December 4, 1981 (United States) Country of origin United States Languages Greek English Also known as Şahin tepesi Filming locations Saddlerock Ranch - 32111 Mulholland Highway, Malibu, California, USA Production companies Amanda & MF Lorimar Television See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour Color Color Sound mix Mono Aspect ratio 4:3 Related news Alvin Ing, Actor in ‘Flower Drum Song’ and ‘Pacific Overtures’ on Broadway, Dies at 89 Aug 4The Hollywood Reporter - Film + TV Alvin Ing, Pioneering Asian American Broadway Actor, Dies at 89 Aug 3Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the English language plot outline for Falcon Crest (1981)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
