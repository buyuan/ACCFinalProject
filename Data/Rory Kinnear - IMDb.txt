Personal Quote: I don't where it came from and how these things evolve. I haven't been and I am totally certain that I will not be asked to be the next Doctor Who (2005). If I was an actor who was really longing to play Doctor Who, then this would be torturous, but it's a programme I've never watched, so I don't even really know what it is.

He is the godson of the late Michael Williams.
