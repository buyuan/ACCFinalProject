Connections Featured in Jeremy Vine: Episode #3.207 (2020) User reviews140 Review Top review Amazing show I am not much of a TV series person, I usually prefer movies but I decided to give this one a shot since Anna Kendrick is one of my favourite actresses out there. I saw the first episode and I thought it was okay, nothing particularly exciting, just a chill rom com but right now I am absolutely hooked. After watching every episode so far I can confidently say that this is a great TV show with great acting and plot. I am not biased, when an actor/actress I love does a bad job I'll be the first to acknowledge it so believe me when I say that Anna Kendrick shines with a hilarious yet partially heart breaking performance and she's a reason alone to watch this. The script is also very interesting with many ups and downs (emotionally speaking) and I am thrilled every time an episode comes out. If you are looking for something relaxing and entertaining to watch this show is for you. If you want something more exciting then you might not be particularly thrilled about this but I think it's still worth watching. Definitely recommended. helpful•12 10 evrivali Jun 10, 2020 Details Edit Release date May 27, 2020 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Особисте життя Filming locations Queens, New York City, New York, USA Production companies Feigco Entertainment Lionsgate Television Lionsgate See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 35 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Related news 10 Characters On HBO's Love Life, Ranked By Likability Nov 16ScreenRant.com ‘Love Life’ Star Jessica Williams on Going Deep With Mia in Season 2 Nov 15TV Insider Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
