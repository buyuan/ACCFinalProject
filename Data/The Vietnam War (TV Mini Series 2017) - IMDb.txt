Visceral and immersive, the series explores the human dimensions of the war through revelatory testimony of nearly 80 witnesses from all sides-Americans who fought in the war and others who opposed it, as well as combatants and civilians from North and South Vietnam. Ten years in the making, the series includes rarely seen and digitally re-mastered archival footage from sources around the globe, photographs taken by some of the most celebrated photojournalists of the 20th Century, historic television broadcasts, evocative home movies, and secret audio recordings from inside the Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon administrations. THE VIETNAM WAR features more than 100 iconic musical recordings from greatest artists of the era and haunting original music from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross as well as the Silk Road Ensemble featuring Yo-Yo Ma. vietnamvietnam waramerican historyvietnamese historysoutheast asia26 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines There is no single truth in war.

Connections Featured in Ken Burns: America's Storyteller (2017) User reviews161 Review Top review 10/10 Monumental Documentary This is overwhelming. This documentary had me riveted through all 10 episodes. I recorded it, but could never proceed directly to the next episode because so much emotion was packed into each one. I had to give at least a day between each viewing. After viewing an episode I would shut the TV off. Watching anything after would have been anti-climatic compared to the intensity of what I had just absorbed. Among many excellent passages from the documentary, this is one of my favourite commentaries: "It is very, very difficult to dispel ignorance if you retain arrogance". We are provided with the full panoply of the Vietnam War, with many different viewpoints and opinions. From start to finish this is visually engrossing. Full congratulations go to the makers of this unforgettable documentary. helpful•94 12 MikeyB1793 Oct 14, 2017 Details Edit Release date September 17, 2017 (United States) Official sites Ken Burns The Vietnam War Website Official Facebook Language English Also known as Війна у В'єтнамі Production company Florentine Films See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 16 hours 30 minutes Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news ‘Gradually, Then Suddenly: The Bankruptcy Of Detroit’ Wins $200K Library Of Congress Lavine/Ken Burns Documentary Prize Oct 26Deadline Film + TV Variety Honors Hong Kong’s Long-Distance Runners at Nyaff Aug 6Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was The Vietnam War (2017) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
