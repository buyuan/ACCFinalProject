Personal Quote: When I was young, I had a favorite movie star. One day I saw one of his movies and it was bad and he was bad in it. I could tell he didn't care and only did it for the money. I felt betrayed. I never watched another one of his movies again. To my German fans I will always do my best, no matter what. It means a lot that you believe in me. I won't let you down.
