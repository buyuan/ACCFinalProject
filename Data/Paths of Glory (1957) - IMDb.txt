Genres Drama War Certificate Approved Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Banned in Spain under Gen. Francisco Franco's dictatorship for its anti-military message. It wasn't released until 1986, 11 years after Franco's death. Goofs As Col. Dax is running through the trenches after Gen. Mireau gives his order, a "dead" soldier blinks. Quotes Colonel Dax: Gentlemen of the court, there are times that I'm ashamed to be a member of the human race and this is one such occasion. Connections Edited into Hai-Kubrick (1999) Soundtracks La Marseillaise (1792) (uncredited) Written by Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle In the score during the opening credits User reviews472 Review Top review 10/10 An anti-war movie hitting closer to home. I consider Paths of Glory as one of the most memorable of Kubrick's entire output. The most remarkable aspect of this pioneer anti-war film is the complete absence of any persons depicting the "real" enemy. Therefore, the significance of the film lay not so much in its anti-war message, but in its brilliant expose of the "monsters within" the general staff, superbly acted by Adolphe Menjou and George Macready. The message here is that the enemy lurks much closer to home. In most war films, whether they glorify or condemn the carnage, there is rarely any venturing at all into the darker side of the politics. This film is a tour de force in its unabashed depiction of just how misguided is the quest for glory as an end in itself; and in the portrayal of the leaders who would shamelessly sacrifice others for their own self aggrandizement. Truly, one of my all time favourite movies. helpful•148 16 bmaclach Nov 3, 2000 FAQ1 Is "Paths of Glory" based on a book?
