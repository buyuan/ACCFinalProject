Seven are adopted by Sir Reginald Hargreeves, a billionaire industrialist, who creates The Umbrella Academy and prepares his "children" to save the world. But not everything went according to plan. In their teenage years, the family fractured and the team disbanded. Now almost thirty years old, the six surviving members reunite upon the news of Hargreeves' passing. Luther, Diego, Allison, Klaus, Vanya and Number Five work together to solve a mystery surrounding their father's death. But the estranged family once again begins to come apart due to their divergent personalities and abilities, not to mention the imminent threat of a global apocalypse. —jesusblack-30225 alternate historysuperherodark horse comicsbased on comic booktime travel25 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Super Strong Genres Action Adventure Comedy Drama Fantasy Sci-Fi Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Aidan Gallagher (Five) was not allowed to be on set during any gun fight scenes because of child labor laws.
