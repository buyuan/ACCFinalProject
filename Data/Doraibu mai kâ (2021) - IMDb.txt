Connections Edited into Amanda the Jedi Show: Faster than your First Time Reviews 2 - Best and Worst of TIFF 2021 (2021) User reviews5 Review Top review 7/10 Long roadtrips Fancy a 55min long Prologue? Look no further! This surely is an unconventional movie, that combines the principles of acting, story structure and well written dialogue so well, that you at times forget, that you are NOT watching an acting masterclass. This movie is not an easy watch, its 3h long and yes, you feel it, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. In my opinion, the movie could have cut out 30mins, but the length is used as a storytelling device as well and the movie takes its time to flash out its characters to make them 3-dimensional, which works very well for most of them. For a movie that has no less than 7 languages in it and (as far as I can judge from the subs) well written dialogue, there is so much left unsaid and left in between the lines for you to interpret. The weakness of this movie unfortunately is its ending, which didnt satisfy me in the way you would expect a 3h movie to wrap up, but this is just my opinion and you might feel different about it. The ride is certainly worth hopping on! helpful•3 0 FilmFlowCritics Oct 15, 2021 Details Edit Release date August 20, 2021 (Japan) Country of origin Japan Official sites Official site Official site (Japan) Languages Japanese English Korean Sign Language German Mandarin Tagalog Korean Indonesian Also known as Drive My Car Filming locations Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, Naka-ku, Hiroshima City, Hiroshima, Japan Production companies Bitters End C&I Entertainment Culture Entertainment See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross worldwide $1,547,270 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 2 hours 59 minutes Color Color Related news ‘Eternals’ Tops U.K. Box Office, ‘No Time to Die’ Continues Blockbuster Business Nov 16Variety Film + TV Sydney Film Festival prizes for ‘There Is No Evil’, ‘I’m Wanita’, Karina Holden Nov 15IF.com.au Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Doraibu mai kâ (2021) officially released in Japan in Japanese?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
