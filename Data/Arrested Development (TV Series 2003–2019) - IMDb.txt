This family was once at the height of real estate development in Orange County, California. But when the family business - the Bluth Company - goes bust, they're suddenly found penniless with their assets frozen. They move into their last remaining asset - the model home left over from their latest housing tract. Their luxury vehicles are replaced with a reminder of the family's former wealth: 'the stair car that accompanied their private jet'. The patriarch of the family is George Bluth - he's now in prison, and loving every minute of it. His wife Lucille and daughter Lindsay are spoiled socialites who can't handle getting kicked out of family restaurants. His son Buster is in his mid 30's and lives at home. His son George Oscar Bluth is a magician who started a group to get magicians to be taken seriously, and gets kicked out when his own tricks are revealed. Lindsay is married to a man named Tobias Funke, once a psychiatrist, who decides to become an actor. The only sane member of the family: Michael Bluth, along with his son George Michael, want nothing to do with the family business. But one bizarre circumstance after another keeps Michael and George Michael from leaving their eccentric family. —halo1k dysfunctional familyamateur magicianfailed actorblue manorange county california61 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Get Arrested Genre Comedy Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Neither David Cross's nor Jeffrey Tambor's characters were ever intended to be regular characters. It was not until the actors tested well that the writers ended up putting them regularly in the series. Goofs During the time George Sr spends in the attic, storage boxes in the background are marked with either "Tracy" or "Tracey." These are boxes of old clothes belonging to Michael's late wife. Quotes Narrator: Tobias listens to a day's worth of his own words, to see what Michael was referring to... Tobias Fünke: [on tape] ... even if it means me taking a chubby, I will suck it up. Tobias Fünke: Nothing wrong with that. Tobias Fünke: [on tape] Oh, I've been in the film business for a while, but I just can't seem to get one in the can. Tobias Fünke: It's out of context. Tobias Fünke: [on tape] I wouldn't mind kissing that man between the cheeks. Narrator: ...and he realized there is something distinct about the way he speaks. Tobias Fünke: Tobias, you blowhard. [chuckles] Connections Featured in The 61st Annual Golden Globe Awards 2004 (2004) Soundtracks Arrested Development Composed by David Schwartz (opening theme) User reviews455 Review Top review best comedy on TV today this comedy is smart where so many others are not. its one of the few shows on today that you find DO NOT have a laugh track which alone makes it unique, but with the excellent writing and acting make it a refreshing and hilarious change. after a few episodes, it all makes sense and is that much funnier once you know the characters and their very individual quirks. this show deserved all of the awards it won plus a few more just to make sure it gets noticed. its been voted TV-lands "future classic" after only a single season if thats any clue to those who haven't seen it yet. the dry acting of jason bateman and the voice over by ron howard are both stellar and add greatly to the shows overall style. watch this show as soon as it begins again (nov 7, 2004 after the simpsons) you wont be sorry. helpful•181 38 xircso Oct 21, 2004 FAQ19 Why was it cancelled? Where can I watch the show for free online? In the second episode they burn the banana stand but in later episodes, it's still standing. How?
