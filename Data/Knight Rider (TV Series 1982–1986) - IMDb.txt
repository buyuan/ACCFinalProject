Nursed back to health by a mysterious benefactor (chairman and CEO of Knight Industries), he regains consciousness as a new man with a new face and a new name: Michael Knight. His mysterious benefactor (through the guise of associate Devon Miles) provides Michael with equipment and support so that he can continue his crime fighting against those who operate above the law. The most notable piece of equipment supplied, is "KITT", an indestructible, high-performance car fitted with artificial intelligence. —Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au> vehicle driving by itselfprivate detectivecrime fighterpontiac trans am1980s57 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Action Crime Drama Sci-Fi Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia David Hasselhoff and William Daniels (the voice of K.I.T.T.) did not meet until the production's Christmas party, six months after filming season one. Until that point, Hasselhoff had not seen the face behind the voice of the car. Goofs Every time KITT drives into the mobile headquarters we can clearly see that the car just barely fits, with only a few inches clearance from each side, yet Michael is able to swing the door open and get out. Quotes [opening narration] Narrator: Knight Rider, a shadowy flight into the dangerous world of a man, who does not exist. Connections Edited into Hollywood Burn (2006) User reviews98 Review Top review Nowhere near as bad as it's made out to be The basic premise of Knight Rider has already been covered here numerous times, so I'm not going to delve into that. Everyone knows that Knight Rider is about an ex-cop with a new identity, working for a private foundation that provides him with an indestructible super car. But if you read some of the reviews here, you might think that Knight Rider is the worst TV show that was ever made. Knight Rider could get corny at times but it was nowhere near as terrible as some people say it is. There's nothing at all wrong with a show being campy. Knight Rider wasn't "all about a cool car" either. If that was true then why didn't the two attempts to revive the show in the 90s work? Knight Rider 2000 in the early 90s and Team Knight Rider in the late 90s both failed to recapture the 80s glory of the original. Team Knight Rider even had 5 talking super vehicles. That proves that there was something to David Hasselhoff (Michael Knight), William Daniels (voice of KITT) and Edward Mulhare (Devon). They had a special chemistry that made the series work. David Hasselhoff for all his William Shatner overacting antics, made the show work too. Another man might have tried to play the material seriously, but the Hoff knew better. Knight Rider wasn't a show that was trying to change the world, it was merely a one hour action/adventure block of entertainment. The people slamming Knight Rider were probably too old to appreciate the show as children in the 80s, or they are too young to have been around in the 80s. I bet a lot of these mean spirited comments are from some dopey Generation Y kids born in 1989 or something like that. I think the shows success speaks for itself. helpful•85 11 ashjourney Mar 14, 2006 Details Edit Release date September 26, 1982 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as El auto fantástico Filming locations Riverside International Raceway, 22255 Eucalyptus Avenue, Moreno Valley, California, USA Production companies Glen A.
