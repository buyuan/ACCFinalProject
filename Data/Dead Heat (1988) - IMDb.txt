Or should I say they are chasing dead crooks perpetrating serious crimes? Seems some nutcase has learned how to bring back the dead and is sending them on crime sprees. Now these indestructable goons are in the way of officers Mortis and Bigelow. To even things up, when Mortis is killed (in the line of duty, of course) he gets a jump start from the Resurrection machine and takes the fight to the zombie bad guys. —Tim Kretschmann <Tim.K@VirComm.com> armed robberypolice partnermorguesuicideuzi65 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines These cops are on the biggest murder case of their lives... their own. Genres Action Comedy Horror Sci-Fi Thriller Certificate R Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The building used for Dante Pharmaceuticals is also the set of the movie Bio-Dome 8 years later. Goofs When Roger is examined by Rebecca after his resurrection, he cuts himself and does not bleed as he is found to have no pulse. Later he is shot and bleeds from his wounds, which contradicts his earlier examination. Quotes Det. Doug Bigelow: [He shuts the porno mag the clerk's being reading] Sorry to interrupt your erection. Alternate versions The film suffered numerous cuts to the gore in order to receive an "R" rating instead of an "X". Connections Edited into Cent une tueries de zombies (2012) Soundtracks Dead Heat Written by John Huckert (as John W. Huckert Jr.), Patrick Read Johnson & Phil Settle (as Philip J. Settle) Performed by Phil Settle Copyright © 1987 by: Sarah Beth Songs BMI User reviews86 Review Top review 6/10 What a goofy action / comedy should be One of Joe Piscopo better movies, Dead Heat is a fun ride that is filled with action and wild comedy. Treat Williams stars in this interesting story about the walking dead. Not a horror movie about zombies, but the living dead committing crimes. Williams and Piscopo do justice to this low budget movie. The story itself holds its own as the limited special effects can only take the audience too far. The comic relief of Piscopo fills in the gaps where the gun fights and walking dead miss. Treat Williams shows his leading man qualities in Dead Heat while he has failed to do so in other movies. In the end, the movie produces an enjoyable ride for action fans. One of Vincent Prices' last movies, he is the icing on the cake of the b-movie that Dead Heat is. helpful•18 5 caspian1978 Oct 2, 2004 FAQ1 What are the differences between the Original Version and the Extended Version?
