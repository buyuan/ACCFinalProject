They acknowledge classic crime-solving - MMO - as no longer sufficient because criminality is becoming more complicated as Motive graduates from need and greed to inexplicable and irrational reasons. They theorize applying deeper psychological evaluation will posit new questions. Simply, asking Why will lead to the Who. This series focuses on the development by two men, two agents, of a new criminal field and does so through story lines of visiting the sociopathic mind. —sasisami prisoninterviewpolicepolice investigationmurder21 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines History. Pattern. Profile. Genres Crime Drama Thriller Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The interview scenes are based upon the actual interviews with said serial killers, sometimes almost word for word. Goofs There is a scene where Tench is sitting at a table drinking whiskey. Whilst the label is pointing away from the camera, it is possible to tell from the embossing on the side of the glass bottle that it is a bottle of Bushmills Northern Irish whisky. This specific 'embossed' bottle type was first introduced to market in 2010. And was certainly not around in the 70's when this show is set. Connections Featured in WatchMojo: Top 10 Best TV Shows This Fall (2017) User reviews873 Review Top review 8/10 Dont listen to the commenters giving low ratings. The few people here who are rating this a 1,2 or a 3 have no clue what makes a TV show. They also have no clue what actual acting is. No this show is not one of those shows where a serial killer is shown stabbing their victim to death. We dont see the cops chasing down the bad guys and saving the day. What we see is some amazing acting from some beyond amazing actors, giving us the stories of these true crimes. So if at all you're interested in these type of true crimes dont listen to these people giving low ratings who do not have any idea what they're talking about. This show is worth watching. helpful•208 62 triforce-88931 Feb 20, 2019 FAQ7 This serial has a connection with 2004 movie Mindhunters? Is this an episodic series?
