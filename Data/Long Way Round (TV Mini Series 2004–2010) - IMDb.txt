Genres Documentary Adventure Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia In 1997, prior to making this series, actor Ewan McGregor was in an episode of the American TV series "ER" which was similarly titled: The Long Way Around (1997). Quotes Ewan McGregor: [doing a video diary] Where in this place called White Horse... maybe it's not called White Horse. Ewan McGregor: [takes video to motel room, Charley answers door] Charley. Charley Boorman: Yeah? Ewan McGregor: Where are we? Charley Boorman: In a motel. Ewan McGregor: No, what's the name of the town? Charley Boorman: Uh... something donkey. Isn't it? Slim's Donkey or Knuckle Donkey? Starving Donkey! Ur... I donno. Ewan McGregor: [now inside the motel room] Ok, the upshot is we have no idea where we are. Can't remember the name of the town that we're in. Oh! It might be on the receipt. [checks receipt] Ewan McGregor: Hungry Horse! Alternate versions On its original airing, the series featured seven episodes. The original 2-disc DVD set comprises these original episodes. The show has subsequently been re-edited into a 10-episode series. Notably, the preparation for the trip has been extended over two episodes. There is also additional footage during the trip itself. There is also an entirely new tenth episode, a retrospective of their journey. This extended series has been broadcast on Sky television in the UK, and is also available on a new 3-disc DVD set. Connections Featured in Long Way Up: Colombia, Panama & Costa Rica (2020) User reviews56 Review Top review 10/10 excellent!!!! When I've seen it first on Viasat Explorer, I was stunned!!!! The great show especially the moments at Russia and Mongolia where the crew meet most of the difficulties on the long way round. Warm and sensitive, the show here touches you even if you are not a bike person. (And now I replay the tape over and over again!) I was crying in tears watching most of the episodes 'cause this show is not like any other show, this is the real thing! Emotions, drama, excitement, homesickness,... from the bottom of their hearts. If you haven't seen this series.... YOU JUST HAVE TO! (sorry for my poor English,..... and all the best to all the crew of the Long Way Round !!!! especially Ewan, Charlie and Claudio ) helpful•7 1 vladimir_bgyu Mar 4, 2006 FAQ1 Why has this program been scrubbed from the internet it isn't available to stream or download anywhere.
