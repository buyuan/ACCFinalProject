Soundtracks That Loving Feeling Performed by Isaac Hayes Written by Tony Joe White Courtesy of Craft Recordings, a division of Concord User reviews232 Review Top review 6/10 The Protégé Martin Campbell directed the landmark BBC thriller Edge of Darkness in 1985. He was then given the task to reboot the James Bond franchise twice. Nowadays Campbell is a veteran relegated to making B movies. The Protégé has plenty of raw action, some of the violence is hard edged. The plot is forgettable and half baked. Anna (Maggie Q) was taken in by an assassin called Moody (Samuel L Jackson) who found her as a child in Vietnam. Moody has trained Anna to be a contract killer. She also uses a vintage bookshop in London as a front. One day a man called Rembrandt (Michael Keaton) walks into her shop and Anna's world changes. Soon people she knows have been killed and Anna goes after the baddies for revenge. The finale ends up in Vietnam where Anna's traumatic past is revealed. Along the way Ann has several showdowns with the enigmatic Rembrandt who is a fixer for a shady billionaire philanthropist who once faked his own death. The Protégé is a slickly action thriller let down by a poor plot which holds little surprises. Maggie Q is fine. Samuel L Jackson can do this in his sleep. Keaton makes the most of the action scenes which is remarkable given his age. Although he gives the movie some class, you get the feeling he is slumming it after a career boost from movies such as Birdman and Spotlight. helpful•10 6 Prismark10 Sep 1, 2021 Details Edit Release date August 20, 2021 (United States) Countries of origin United States United Kingdom Official site Official site Language English Also known as The Asset Filming locations Bucharest, Romania Production companies Arthur Sarkissian Productions Campbell Grobman Films Fourteen Films See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross US & Canada $7,446,823 Opening weekend US & Canada $2,908,221 Aug 22, 2021 Gross worldwide $8,231,178 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 49 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 2.39 : 1 Related news ‘French Dispatch’ and ‘Last Night in Soho’ Start to Lift Stagnant Specialty Box Office Nov 9Indiewire ‘Free Guy’ Tops VOD Charts One Last Time as Two Eastwoods Debut Nov 8Indiewire Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What was the official certification given to The Protégé (2021) in Brazil?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
