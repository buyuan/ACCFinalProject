There is also a lot here for the casual viewer, especially if they enjoy different art styles and noir-type storytelling. The only downside to this series is that since each episode is only a few minutes long and have no connection, the tone can vary greatly and there is no real consistency, apart from the black and white nature of the show. Even this differs as some storytellers took this to mean a take on the moralistic nature of Batman, others took it to mean wartime era, and others took it far more literally. As such the stories jump around in time period, artistic style and overall theme to a high degree. On the plus side this also shows the versatility of the Batman character and means there will certainly be something for everyone, just don't expect a through-arc, character development or anything like that. helpful•4 1 scythertitus Jun 7, 2017 Details Edit Release date December 8, 2008 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Betmen - Crno i belo Production company Sequence Post See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Color Black and White Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 1.78 : 1 / (high definition) Related news Gerard Way’s Batman, Joker Statues Tease the Dark Knight Story We Need Feb 15Comic Book Resources Hellboy: Into The Silent Sea Graphic Novel Announced by Dark Horse Aug 11DailyDead Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Batman: Black and White (2008) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
