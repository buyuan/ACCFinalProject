The reason: Coke acts as a liquid adhesive. For example, it was used for the motorbike jump scene in order to make the ramp surface sticky so as to deter the bike from sliding. Reportedly, the production spilt the soft drink all over the streets of Matera for the bike and car chases requiring a big clean up job afterwards. Stunt Coordinator Lee Morrison said: "I've been spraying Coca-Cola on slippery surfaces for a very long time" with the drink able to "make things look very clean after it washes off". 184 of 186 found this interesting Interesting?

In these, Craig's Bond movies have only used the classic Maurice Binder graphics once. In each of the movies, a new gun-barrel walk sequence was filmed with the actor. In 'Casino Royale' (2006), the sequence was worked into Bond's first kill as a Double-O Agent. For 'Quantum of Solace' (2008) and 'Skyfall' (2012), the gun-barrel walk was moved from their traditional place right at the start of the film to just before the end credits roll. 'Spectre' (2015)'s gun-barrel walk used the Binder graphics and were sequenced in their traditional opening spot. In 'No Time to Die' (2021), the gun barrel sequence is still at the beginning but is uses CGI (computer generated imagery) for the contours graphics of the inside of the gun. Moreover, there is no red blood falling colour at the end of the gun-shot component of the gun-barrel walk, the first time this has happened in the series.

Paramount came close to snapping up Bond but walked away from MGM's demands and the relatively low 8 per cent distribution fee MGM was willing to pay.

Bond is sent to assassinate Shatterhand (who's really Blofeld) because he operates a 'Garden of Death' filled with poisonous plants, deadly snakes and more. Safin [Rami Malek]'s effort isn't as extravagant as that garden, but his interpretation is probably the closest Bond fans will get to seeing the 'Garden of Death' come to life after the movie version of 'You Only Live Twice' [1967] turned out to be very different to the book. His' 'poison garden' is probably why Safin has to wear gloves all the time and not because he's got prosthetic metal hands like Dr No, as the theories speculated.'' 6 of 10 found this interesting Interesting?

In 'The World is Not Enough' (1999), they were Elektra King (Sophie Marceau) and Renard aka Victor Zokas (aka The Anarchist) (Robert Carlyle). In 'No Time to Die' (2021), they are Safin (Rami Malek) and Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Christoph Waltz), the latter being the arch-villain from the previous Bond movie 'Spectre' (2015). All these four villains are concluded by Bond. 3 of 4 found this interesting Interesting?

In the 1970's French spy spoof 'From Hong Kong with Love' (Bons baisers de Hong-Kong) (1975), which had a title referencing 'From Russia with Love' (1963), during the opening gun-barrel walk sequence, James Bond is shot dead and killed. It is then that Her Majesty's Secret Service must replace him. James Bond also dies at the end of the 1960s Bond spoof 'Casino Royale' (1967), but like 'No Time to Die' (2021), at the end. 4 of 6 found this interesting Interesting?

They were specifically designed to imitate the kind of explosion that missiles from a Royal Navy warship would produce. These types of blasts are know as bunker-buster bombs. The explosions were detonated and filmed by the movie's second unit at Britain's Ministry of Defence's Military Training Area at Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire, England. In the movie, the big bangs are seen at the end exploding on Safin's lair with the explosion footage being digitally composited onto the plates shot at the Faroe Islands which portrayed Safin's Island. Near the explosion site resides Hankley Common which was used for filming Bond's home estate and lodge in 'Skyfall' (2012). That earlier Bond movie's director Sam Mendes later used Salisbury Plain for battle scenes in '1917' (2019). For 'No Time to Die' (2021), 135.4 kg of explosives were set off for the three-in-one shot explosions with the production hoping to get the blasts into the Guinness Book of World Records. In the previous Bond movie 'Spectre' (2015), also directed by Sam Mendes, the massive explosion seen in the latter part of the film at the meteorite crater base was awarded a Guinness World Record as the largest movie stunt explosion of all time. 1 of 1 found this interesting Interesting?

In Casino Royale (2006), when James Bond was poisoned, at one point, the heart monitoring machine indicates that his heart has stopped beating. Technically, he dies before he is resuscitated. As such, this was the first instance in an official Bond movie that the character died. He then lived for a second time, as per the haiku and Ian Fleming novel and movie You Only Live Twice (1967). As such, Craig's James Bond character has actually died twice in the official series. In the opening sequence of From Russia with Love (1963), James Bond appeared to have been killed, but his face revealed another agent under a mask, and in You Only Live Twice (1967), his death was faked during the beginning of the movie. The cited haiku (poem) in Ian Fleming's "You Only Live Twice" novel reads: "You only live twice. Once when you are born. And once when you look death in the face." In the Bond spoof Casino Royale (1967), James Bond (actually several James Bonds, the real one, and six namesakes) ultimately dies, and goes to heaven. 4 of 10 found this interesting Interesting?

The pre-credits sequence features Safin in a Noh mask running around chasing a young Madeleine Swann. This sequence has been likened to the similar notion of an evil clown running around chasing children as with Stephen King's ''IT'' which Fukunaga had previously been working on. He was developing the ''IT'' reboots at Warner Bros. when left the project over creative differences. He made the comparison by laughingly saying: ''Some clown chasing a child around the house. Yeah, it's like I brought back 'IT' in the first five minutes of Bond.'' IndieWire commented: ''While Fukunaga never got to realize his 'IT' movie, it seems he's brought a bit of that horror spirit to his Bond movie...'No Time to Die'.'' In the earlier James Bond movie 'Octopussy' (1983), Roger Moore as Agent 007 was at one point in the film dressed as a clown wearing full clown make-up. 2 of 5 found this interesting Interesting?

In 'No Time to Die' (2021), it is suggested and/or revealed that the Q character is gay when Q (played by openly gay 'out' actor Ben Whishaw) mentions that his friend coming for dinner is male by saying ''he''. Previously, in October 2012, controversy broke out in the media and the web about 'Skyfall' (2012)'s homoerotic overtones from Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem) directed towards James Bond, who traditionally has been a devout heterosexual ladies' man. The furor suggested that Silva may be the first ever ''Male Bond Girl" and that the current Bond may actually be or have been bi-sexual. However, it was not the first time that a male Bond villain had been suggested to be gay, as the henchmen Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd characters in Diamonds Are Forever (1971) were camp characters. 'Skyfall' (2012) was the second time in three Daniel Craig Bond movies that his 007 character had been tied to a chair and tormented by the main villain. In Casino Royale (2006), Bond had his testicles beaten by Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) with a knotted rope. In 'Skyfall' (2012), Bond's chest is caressed by Raoul Silva, then both his legs are then groped with two hands by Silva. There was also an out-of-shot inference that Bond's testicles were fondled between shots, making the scene controversial in a similar way to the scene in Casino Royale (2006). 3 of 11 found this interesting Interesting?

It is believed that Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham) is killed at the end of the first film but it is revealed via an editing trick that Bishop escaped the exploding vehicle just seconds before the blast. This survival ruse could also be applied to Bond who could also receive an anti-dote to the nanobots. In 'Skyfall' (2012), James Bond (Daniel Craig) at one point says he has been "enjoying death" adding that "everybody needs a hobby" with his being "resurrection". A ''Bond Lives'' scenario is potentially possible given what happens in the 'Mechanic' and its sequel. The 'Mechanic' sequel has a ''resurrection'' subtitle and completely Bondian nature utilizing many tropes from the series: 'Moonraker' Rio and 'The Man with the Golden Gun' Phuket locations; casting of former 'Tomorrow Never Dies' Bond Girl Michelle Yeoh; cable-car action sequence; Bond like villain's lair; stunt-work by Bond stunt supremo Vic Armstrong, submarine pen and aquatic escape pod. 5 of 29 found this interesting Interesting?

And that is the character name of . . . . . ''Segura''. In Matt Purslow's early interview with production designer Mark Tildesley published by IGN, he said: ''Our baddie, who is the person that comes to do damage at Madeleine's house in the sequence in Norway, is called Segura and he is played by Rami Malek." When the main cast and character name list was first revealed in 2019, the name of Rami Malek's villain was not publicised. Later, in one interview with Malek during the course of pre-publicity in early 2020, he stated: ''What's my final character name?'', all this suggesting that there was a protracted process deciding what his character name would be. Pre-release speculation that Malek was playing a new version of Dr. No was, two weeks before release, debunked by director Cary Joli Fukanaga. 1 of 3 found this interesting Interesting?

In the earlier Bond movie 'Live and Let Die' (1973), Tee Hee (Julius Harris) had an artificial metal arm.
