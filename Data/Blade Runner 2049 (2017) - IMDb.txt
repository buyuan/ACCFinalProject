Officer "K" (Ryan Gosling), unearths a long-buried secret that has the potential to plunge what's left of society into chaos. K's discovery leads him on a quest to find Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), a former L.A.P.D. Blade Runner, who has been missing for thirty years. —Warner Bros. Pictures female nudityenvironmental damagecorporatistcapitalismsex scene560 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines The key to the future is finally unearthed. Genres Drama Mystery Sci-Fi Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for violence, some sexuality, nudity and language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia David Bowie was director Denis Villeneuve's first choice for the role of Niander Wallace, but he died before the start of shooting. Goofs (at around 2h 30 mins) At the end of the film when K leans back against the steps, you can see an indention in the snow where his elbow is about to be placed, leading one to believe that this is a continuity error and that the indentation is from a previous take. However, if you look as he sits down, he places his hand on the step to lower himself down, creating the indentation where his elbow will later rest. Quotes Niander Wallace: Pain reminds you the joy you felt was real. More joy, then! Do not be afraid. Crazy credits There are no opening credits, and the title proper is not shown until the ending credits. Alternate versions The IMAX print viewed by Turkish film critics at the movie's press screening in two days advance of its Turkish theatrical release censors nudity by digital zooming. Since the movie had not yet been classified by Turkish censors at the time of the press screening, this intervention appears to have been carried out by Sony Pictures for the Turkish market, as well as for some non-Western markets in general.

This reminds me when films were worth my time and money and had serious actors. helpful•120 31 naoto666 Sep 18, 2021 FAQ13 What is Blade Runner 2049 about? Why are replicants designed vulnerable? A human would be killed by a shot or a stabbing, but why would a replicant be? Why design a robot and make them as frail as a human? When K is visiting Wallace Corp, he walks past a number of frozen bodies. The camera pans and focuses on the last one and freezes for just a second or two. Is that a replicate model of Harrison Ford's or of Hauer's character? What is the significance of stopping on that name plate and face?
