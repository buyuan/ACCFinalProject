Personal Quote: [on filming sex scenes] You sort of try to set some ground rules. I think it was Sir Laurence Olivier who said, "I apologize if I get aroused and I apologize if I do not get aroused." There's always that awkward state of "Is this okay? Is that okay?" In between it's just like "Let's act like nothing happened." Then you see how good an actor you really are.
