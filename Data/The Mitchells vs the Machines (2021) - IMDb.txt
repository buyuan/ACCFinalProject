No big deal, right? It all starts when creative outsider Katie Mitchell is accepted into the film school of her dreams and is eager to leave home and find "her people," when her nature-loving dad insists on having the whole family drive her to school and bond during one last totally-not-awkward-or-forced road trip. But just when the trip can't get any worse, the family suddenly finds itself in the middle of the robot uprising. Everything from smart phones, to roombas, to evil Furbys are employed to capture every human on the planet. Now it's up to the Mitchells, including upbeat mom Linda, quirky little brother Aaron, their squishy pug, Monchi, and two friendly, but simple-minded robots to save humanity. —Netflix robotdogroad tripfurbyfamily road trip47 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Genres Animation Adventure Comedy Family Sci-Fi Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG for action and some language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia When the movie was completed, the producers sent crew members statues of Monchi that said "You Guys Are My People". Goofs A freeze frame of Katie's driver's license shows her date of birth as 5-14-2003. But the recording of her father moving out of the cabin with baby Katie is timestamped "May 08 2003." Quotes Mark Bowman: It's almost like stealing people's data and giving it to a hyper-intelligent AI as part of an unregulated tech monopoly was a bad thing. Crazy credits The Columbia Pictures logo is covered with Katie Mitchell's doodles. Alternate versions The Netflix print adds the opening and closing Netflix logos, as well as "Netflix presents" to the opening credits.

This is an amazingly fun movie from start to finish, benefited by some brilliantly stylized CGI that continues the trend that Spider-Verse started but taken a few steps further with some added medium blending that very much blew my mind. It also helps that 92% of the jokes land right on target. Did I mention that it also has a disarmingly astute emotional core? Honestly, at this rate Sony Pictures Animation may be beating Disney and Pixar at their own game. helpful•351 128 pugpool10 Apr 30, 2021 FAQ2 What is the name of the college that Katie Mitchell is accepted into?
