CBS cancelled it but would run the final nine episodes. The series was highly rated in its second season, right behind The Big Bang Theory, but ratings dropped in season three and didn't recover in early season four. Many felt it was because of the way CBS scheduled it. The show first aired in September it's first season and then kept getting pushed back later in the year the following seasons. It didn't premier until April, almost a year after season three ended, in season four. Goofs Tim is seen with hair in both of the flashbacks. However it is a running joke that he went bald in at least high school. Crazy credits The show opens with the printed tag line, "One Big Family. Four Short Stories.". This is a pun. Each episode consists of four complete stories, presented one at a time. But also, the name of the family is "Short". So the four segments that make up each episode aren't just short stories. They're Short stories. Connections Featured in Late Night with Seth Meyers: Carol Burnett/Colin Hanks/Baio/Abe Laboriel Jr. (2015) User reviews145 Review Top review 9/10 Cancelled!!!
