Goofs The series is set in Los Angeles, California and as we see police and emergency vehicles with their lights on, the lights in front are missing a solid red light. In California, according to the vehicle code, all law enforcement and emergency vehicles are required to have at least one solid red light facing forward. Connections Featured in Late Night with Seth Meyers: James Spader/Jordana Brewster/The Cadillac Three/Elaine Bradley (2016) User reviews623 Review Top review 9/10 Reminds me of the best of the 1980s This series really surprised me. It has been a long time since I looked forward to watching a show as much as this one every week. It reminds me of many good 80s cop or detective shows. No one has been able to equal the buddy cop or detective show formula of the 80s until now. Very well done indeed. helpful•55 8 dz1 Mar 25, 2017 Details Edit Release date September 21, 2016 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Official Facebook Official site Languages English Spanish Arabic Chinese Korean Chechen Slovak Also known as Arma mortal Filming locations 4720 Yarmouth Avenue, Encino, Los Angeles, California, USA Production companies Good Session Lin Pictures Warner Bros.
