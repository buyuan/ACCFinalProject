Goofs In episode 5, there are numerous medical mistakes. For example, a person is intubated from behind the head and with a laryngoscope to prevent intubating the esophagus instead of the trachea. An intubated person cannot make a sound, not even a whimper, because the tube is fixated by a balloon below the vocal cords preventing any air flow through them. An epidural means Clarice would have had a catheter in her back, not just an intravenous catheter. None of the medications she was given in her neck or arm would have taken effect so quickly as it is unlikely that she was hit directly in a vein. They did get the defibrillator and extubation scenes correct though. Connections Referenced in That Star Wars Girl: Clarice Starling TV Show In the Works! Will SJW's Turn Her Into A Mary Sue Too?! (2020) User reviews295 Review Top review 7/10 Enjoyable I found the show enjoyable. For me it evoked memories of reading Thomas Harris novels and the classic original film. I could care less how it compares to Hannibal on NBC. The negative reviews and the legion of hate piled on anything positive said about this show, is utterly ridiculous, one episode in. The Hannibal fan boys need to go away, so the real audience can give this show's potential the chance it deserves. helpful•97 61 jdgtc1 Feb 16, 2021 FAQ1 When is it set?
