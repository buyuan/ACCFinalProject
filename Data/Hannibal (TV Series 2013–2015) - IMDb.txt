Genres Crime Drama Horror Mystery Thriller Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Mads Mikkelsen did all of his own cooking on screen, including the egg trick. He was trained by the show's food stylist, Janice Poon. Goofs The extensive, severe winter settings reveal the Toronto filming sites, rather than represent the Baltimore dramatic setting. Baltimore winters are mild, and snow rarely accumulates on the ground for more than a few days at a time. Yet snow covered landscapes and large accumulations of snow on the streets are common in the series, and there is snowfall to be seen through the window of Hannibal's dining room during nearly every meal. Quotes Dr. Hannibal Lecter: Before we begin, I must warn you... nothing here is vegetarian. Alternate versions US TV network versions aired censored versions of some episodes (removing, for example, rear nudity, paintings showing nude figures and some scenes of violence) with a TV-14 rating. These cut versions were released on Blu-ray in the UK, many of which received the more appropriate 18 rating from the BBFC. However, the American Blu-ray editions of the affected episodes are unrated and billed as Producer's Cuts, which restore the previously censored footage.

They balance that fine line of love and disgust and adoration for one another - it's so beautifully done I just wish this would of continued on after season 3 Definitely not for the weak hearted in regards to gore helpful•17 1 rlranallo Aug 1, 2020 FAQ13 Is Hannibal based on a book?
