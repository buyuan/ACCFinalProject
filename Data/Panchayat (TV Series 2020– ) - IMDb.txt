And he wasn't confirmed on even that role. Raghubir Yadav had worked with him earlier and requested the director to have a look at his audition. The writer and the director liked him so much that they decided to cast him as a primary character. This is Chandan's debut show. Soundtracks Pasa Phenk Written by Nikhil Sachan Performed by Vivek Hariharan Composed by Anurag Saikia User reviews1K Review Top review 10/10 TVF did it again!!! As expected, again brilliant work by TVF. Awasom performance by Jitendra and Raghubir yadav. Very realistic story with nice humour.
