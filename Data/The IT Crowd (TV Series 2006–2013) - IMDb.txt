Goofs During the animated intro, while Moss is smashing the keyboard with a cricket bat, his wrist watch is on his right arm. When they fall down the ventilation shaft, the watch is on his left hand. After the fall, he raises his arms and his watch is gone. Quotes Roy: [repeated throughout the series] [answering the phone] Roy: Hello, IT. Have you tried turning it off and on again? Connections Featured in The British Comedy Awards 2006 Live (2006) User reviews186 Review Top review Brilliant "The IT crowd" is an excellent comedy but requires the viewer to watch the second episode rather than base their judgement on the first episode then snub the entire series. The first episode was a decent attempt to gain the viewers approval however, it was hyped far too much, which made the viewer think that "The IT Crowd" was the next best comedy. When the first episode ended, everyone was disappointed due to the lack of good jokes. There were moments in the first episode that somehow reminded me of the great mind of Graham Linehan who was the writer to "Father Ted" and "Black Books" due to random jokes such as the joke in the credits. The second episode was almost redemption to the first as the cast and Graham Linehan ultimately revealed their true performance. It was almost surreal and had it's connections to "Father Ted" equally weirdness. There was uncontrollable laughter in a lot of areas of the second episode such as the stress class which delivered powerful comedy that would even make "Father Ted" mediocre. I give this comedy a round of applause and wish for an encore. helpful•193 27 bfscr1 Feb 5, 2006 FAQ3 What is the song played at the end of the episode "Dinner Party?" Is the laughter canned or from an audience? What is the comic that Roy reads throughout Season 1?
