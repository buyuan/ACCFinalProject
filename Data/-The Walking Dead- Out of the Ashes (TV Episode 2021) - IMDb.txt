If this season was actually Season One of TWD, there is *no way* that there would have been a Season Two! So boring, so predictable, I see no entertainment value in TWD, anymore. Bailing, three seasons too late. helpful•17 27 rsvp321 Sep 12, 2021 Details Edit Release date September 12, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Filming locations Georgia, USA Production companies American Movie Classics (AMC) Idiot Box Productions Skybound Entertainment See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 47 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 1.78 : 1 Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Spanish language plot outline for Out of the Ashes (2021)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
