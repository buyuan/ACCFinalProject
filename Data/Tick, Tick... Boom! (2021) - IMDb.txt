Days before he's due to showcase his work in a make-or-break performance, Jon is feeling the pressure from everywhere: from his girlfriend Susan, who dreams of an artistic life beyond New York City; from his friend Michael, who has moved on from his dream to a life of financial security; amidst an artistic community being ravaged by the AIDS epidemic. With the clock ticking, Jon is at a crossroads and faces the question everyone must reckon with: What are we meant to do with the time we have? —Netflix composertheateramericannew yorkstory15 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines How much time do we have to do something great?

Correct me if i'm wrong. I've seen so many actors in their respective movies and also off-screen (i.e., just in interviews, not in flesh), this guy is charming on & off-screen. I mean, his acting is so unique and incredibly realistic. He provides extra details and mentions more than required crew members and respects them. I just hope people would give good reviews for this excellent movie. helpful•19 0 marveller-66 Nov 13, 2021 Details Edit Release date November 19, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Official Netflix Language English Also known as tick, tick...Boom!
