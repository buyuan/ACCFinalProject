This was done to create a presentation that would be enhanced for viewing on widescreen television sets. Connections Edited into Race for Space (2010) User reviews72 Review Top review A wonderful reminder The best thing about this series is the fact that it will either teach or remind a great many people about the accomplishments of the race to the moon. Sadly I feel that this is one of the most misunderstood and under appreciated events in human history, thought of by many today as some sort of great patriotic publicity stunt by an insecure America. I feel I can almost read Tom Hank's mind and feel his desire to make people understand the difficulty and significance of the achievement. The series does a wonderful job of placing the entire series of events in context with the political and social climate of the day. We now live in a world where most of us simply take it for granted that we will probably someday travel to, explore and perhaps even colonize other worlds in our solar system and even beyond. This is the only true because hundreds of thousands of people contributed to proving beyond doubt that it can be done. The race to the moon changed us, even if we don't quite realize it, and this series is a reminder of that. helpful•28 3 gandalf-25 Aug 2, 1999 Details Edit Release date April 5, 1998 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as De la Tierra a la Luna Filming locations DeLand, Florida, USA Production companies Clavius Base Go Flight Inc.
