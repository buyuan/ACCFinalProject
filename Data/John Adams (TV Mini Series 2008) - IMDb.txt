Working-class characters were given proportionately worse-looking smiles than the merchants and aristocrats. Goofs When President John Quincy Adams is discussing his goals with his father, he states that he'll outline these objectives in his State of the Union address. The term "State of the Union Address" was not in use until 1934. At that time, 1825, it was referred to as the Annual Message to Congress. Quotes John Hancock: [reluctantly] God save the King. Samuel Adams: God damn the King! Benjamin Franklin: [happily] God bless the King. Who else could've brought such a spirit of unity to the Congress? Connections Featured in Moviemaking in Virginia: Take 3 (2008) Soundtracks Chester By William Billings User reviews132 Review Top review 10/10 Worthy of Golden Globe, Emmy The only t.v. dramas (historical or otherwise) that I would watch was Masterpiece Theatre because they were mostly British made and classy. Now we have something to rival anything that Masterpiece Theatre put out: John Adams. First, the theme music is first rate slowing building up to a quiet crescendo. Second, the photography is of a theatrical release quality. The set and production values are first rate: you feel as if you are in the scenery and living at that time of our history. The makeup and costumes are historically correct or close to it. Finally, what superb acting by Giamatti and the great Laura Linney and the supporting actors are fine. In fact, I can not find a fault with this mini-series so far.I look forward to watching every Sunday on HBO. I agree with others who say this will win Golden Globe and Emmy Awards. For anyone who says this is boring or lacking bloodshed and violence, I say: "Your ignorance is beneath my contempt" - John Adams, 1777( to Samuel Furlong who told Adams that the 'Declaration of Independency would be the death warrant of the colonies." helpful•25 5 helmuthwilliam Apr 7, 2008 Details Edit Release date March 16, 2008 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Official site (United States) Language English Also known as Untitled John Adams Miniseries Filming locations George Wythe House - 101 Palace Green Street, Colonial Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia, USA Production companies HBO Films High Noon Productions Playtone See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 11 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 1.78 : 1 Related news 2021 Emmys explained: ‘The Queen’s Gambit,’ ‘The Crown,’ ‘Ted Lasso’ are big winners, and all made history Sep 20Gold Derby Emmy Records to Watch: Netflix, ‘Ted Lasso’ and Bo Burnham Could All Make History Sep 17The Wrap Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
