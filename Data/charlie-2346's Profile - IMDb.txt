I've enjoyed mystery films all my life. I've read all the Sherlock Holmes stories, most of Agatha Christie's works, and several others. I know a good mystery story when I see it. This film reminds me of those great noir thrillers that take place in the 30's and 40's. Movies like The Maltese Falcon and Chinatown. What was new was the idea of using technology to access memory. Was this film predictable? Yes, but that doesn't make it any less entertaining. It was also like watching a Christopher Nolan film. Just in overall style and feel. I enjoyed it immensely. If you're a fan of noir detective thrillers, watch this film. See more▼See less▲ Robin Hood (2010) Very Good Film 3 April 2021 - 1 out of 2 users found this review helpful. If you like historical accuracy, epic battles, humor, and an original plot, you will enjoy this film. Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott deliver once again. The way it's set up, it could be a sequel to Kingdom of Heaven. See more▼See less▲ Robin Hood (2018) Worst Robin Hood Ever 3 April 2021 This is by far the worst Robin Hood movie ever made. It is full of historical inaccuracies, flashy action sequences, and not even that good of a story. Save yourself the trouble and never watch it. If you want a really good Robin Hood film, watch the one with Russell Crowe. See more▼See less▲ King Arthur (2004) A Great Story 10 February 2021 - 1 out of 1 users found this review helpful. The makers of this film took a piece of historical fact and mixed it with the Arthurian Legend. Yes there was a man named Lucius Artorius Castus who was in Britain for a while with the Roman military. He was in command of Sarmation knights. He did leave Britain however many years before the Romans abandoned it. The film itself is a great work of historical fiction. With an epic and inspirational story of a man who chooses to do the right thing even if it means losing his life. It has some fantastic actors and an unforgettable score by Hans Zimmer. Definitely worth seeing. See more▼See less▲ Knives Out (2019) AWESOME!! 8 February 2020 - 1 out of 4 users found this review helpful. I would definitely give this film two thumbs up. I love a good murder mystery, and this one kept me guessing all the way to nearly the end. Lots of humor, lots of mystery, plus Daniel Craig with a Southern accent makes for a great movie. Can't wait for the sequel.
