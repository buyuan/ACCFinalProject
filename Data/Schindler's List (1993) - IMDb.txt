Based on the true story of Oskar Schindler who managed to save about 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp, it is a testament to the good in all of us. —Harald Mayr <marvin@bike.augusta.de> accountantchampagnevillawomanizersoap219 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire. Genres Biography Drama History Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for language, some sexuality and actuality violence Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia To gather costumes for 20,000 extras, the costume designer took out advertisements seeking clothes. As economic conditions were poor in Poland, many people were eager to sell clothing they still owned from the 1930s and 1940s. Goofs When Schindler and Stern negotiate with the Jewish investors outside the ghetto, Steven Spielberg is reflected on the rear window (his jacket is blowing in the wind). Quotes Oskar Schindler: Power is when we have every justification to kill, and we don't. Amon Goeth: You think that's power? Oskar Schindler: That's what the Emperor said. A man steals something, he's brought in before the Emperor, he throws himself down on the ground. He begs for his life, he knows he's going to die. And the Emperor... pardons him. This worthless man, he lets him go. Amon Goeth: I think you are drunk. Oskar Schindler: That's power, Amon. That is power. Crazy credits The theatrical version juxtaposed images from the film of the actors portraying certain identified "Schindler Jews" as each actual person placed a stone on Schindler's grave. The VHS version does not use this device, showing only the actual persons, credited by name. Alternate versions The film, as shown in most countries, had the song "Yerushalayim shel Zahav" - Jerusalem of Gold - at the end. When the film was shown in Israel, audiences laughed at this, as this song was written after the 1967 war as a pop song! They then re-dubbed a song "Eli Eli" which was written by Hannah Sennesh during WWII over the end which was more appropriate.

Kappus) Performed by Mimi Thoma Courtesy of The RCA Records Label of BMG Music User reviews2K Review Top review 10/10 Amazing! This Movie was sensational. It was a piece of art along with being informational. It told people about the holocaust, and it also told people about the human spirit. It shows how people can just triumph over anything with just some help from one person The things that Spielberg did with the movie was incredible too. The black and white was genius, and how he had the little girl in red and the fire was phenuminal. I have never seen anything like it, Schindler's List is beyond all words. helpful•95 22 crawdidd424 May 3, 2002 FAQ10 Why is the little girl in red? Why was this film shot in black and white? Who are the people at the end and why are they putting stones on the grave?
