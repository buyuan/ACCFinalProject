Genres Comedy Fantasy Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for macabre humor Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Adding more than just make-up to the character, Morticia Addams is always lit separately from everyone else in a scene. Her lighting always consists of one beam of light across her eyes that gradually fades outward to enhance her classic look. Goofs When baby Pubert is put on the block, his bonnet begins to fall off as Pugsley slides him up. In the next shot, his bonnet is tied firmly on his head. Quotes Morticia: Wednesday's at that very special age when a girl has only one thing on her mind. Ellen: Boys? Wednesday: Homicide. Crazy credits Other than the title, there are no opening credits. Alternate versions When Joel first enters the Harmony Hut to join Wednesday and Pugsley, after Gary takes his book away, he looks around and shrieks in horror to see a poster of Michael Jackson on the far wall. This part has been removed from some TV broadcasts. Connections Featured in Siskel & Ebert & the Movies: Addams Family Values/The Snapper/Dangerous Game/The Saint of Fort Washington/Like Water for Chocolate (1993) Soundtracks Theme from The Addams Family (1964) By Vic Mizzy User reviews162 Review Top review Ricci rules This is a film with several excellent performances, but that of Christina "Wednesday" Ricci is near perfect. The reluctant smile outside the "harmony hut" is Oscar material. And Christina as Pocahantas is the very definition of "cute". Of the others, Joan Cusack also stands out. I doubt anyone else could play the part of "the black widow" quite as well, with just the right mix of sleaze and slapstick. Her deranged laughter alone is worth half the rental fee. It may not be a classic but it is solid entertainment, with few if any weak passages. Go and see it! helpful•82 11 leif.hellstrom Nov 3, 2001 Details Edit Release date November 19, 1993 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Addams Family 2 Filming locations Camp Tulequoia, Sequoia Lake, Sequoia National Forest, California, USA Production companies Paramount Pictures Scott Rudin Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $47,000,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $48,919,043 Opening weekend US & Canada $14,117,545 Nov 21, 1993 Gross worldwide $48,919,043 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 34 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 1.33 : 1(original ratio, open matte) Related news ‘House of Gucci’ first reactions: Lady Gaga enters the Best Actress race Nov 10Gold Derby ‘Free Guy’ Tops VOD Charts One Last Time as Two Eastwoods Debut Nov 8Indiewire Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Japanese language plot outline for Addams Family Values (1993)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
