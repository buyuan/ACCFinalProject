In this city of which he knows nothing, he meets several times a young courtesan, the Charpillon, which attracts him to the point of forgetting the other women. Casanova is ready to do anything to achieve her ends, but La Charpillon always escapes under the most diverse pretexts. She challenges him, she wants him to love her as much as he wants. —Diaphana Distribution male nuditymale rear nudityfemale nudityslow motion scene18th century45 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Drama History Romance Parents guide Add content advisory User reviews2 Review Top review 10/10 The tragedy of mid-age infatuation Casanova, "the most powerful man in the world," the adorable phallus, in his mid-years, infatuated with a young woman half his age who doesn't give him enough attention. Isn't this the classical tragedy during all human existence, say from the Bible's King David to the numbers of fifty-year-old divorces nowadays? The sexual power young women have, even the ugliest or less talented one, drives crazy so many men and makes them put in risk their reputation, money, even their own life. Casanova here insists it is more than mere infatuation, and he is correct, his situation is far more complicated than that. What is the truth of his desire then? Is it about some power this particular woman intrinsically has? The movie rightly shows her ambiguously; she is attractive, yes, but also vulgar and manipulative. Therefore, is it something unsatisfying that he sees in himself? Maybe yes. Casanova is a libertine who has built a reputation as a womanizer; he has money, social influences, ex-lovers are fond of him. However, we see him here precisely on the verge of self-humiliation and degradation, risking losing everything just for the sake of receiving care and attention from a love that is impossible only for him. Casanova, "the most powerful man in the world," is the only one who cannot have this woman. This puzzle may be the punishment he unconsciously inflicts on himself, following the legend of Don Giovanni, the quest for moral redemption through self-inflicted spiritual and sexual pain. This movie is a masterpiece, for it shows the moment of realization that all human beings have, at some point, seeing the finitude of their lives. The film is also profoundly humanistic. It shows how and why power relations are complicated and bi-directional, far from what the current MeToo wave of childish self-victimization has popularized in the Anglo-American culture. Script and direction are precise and dynamic here, and the photography is evocative and technically perfect. Actors Lindon and Martin deliver enjoyable parts; they succeed at making this power game vivid and tragic. helpful•3 2 paopinardos Jun 8, 2020 Details Edit Release date March 20, 2019 (Belgium) Countries of origin France Belgium United States Official site Official site (Japan) Languages French English Also known as Casanova, Last Love Filming locations Hever Castle, Edenbridge, Kent, England, UK Production companies Les Films du Lendemain JPG Films Wild Bunch See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget €6,500,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $10,924 Opening weekend US & Canada $2,126 Jul 18, 2021 Gross worldwide $558,717 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 38 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 2.39 : 1 Related news Amazon Prime Video New Releases: November 2021 Nov 1Den of Geek New On Amazon Prime Video For November 2021: Daily Listings For Streaming TV, Movies & More Oct 26Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the English language plot outline for Dernier amour (2019)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
