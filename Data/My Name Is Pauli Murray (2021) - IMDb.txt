User reviews8 Review Top review 10/10 An Unsung Hero This documentary portrays a woman of extraordinary drive, compassion, reason and intelligence. Yet she been an unknown to me until this superbly-constructed documentary becaame available. Kudos to the creators for finding her and making her come alive. How many unrecognizable heroes are out there? I need to open my eyes and find the beautiful and the brave around me. helpful•1 3 somethinginfo Oct 7, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 1, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Julia Production companies Storyville Films Drexler Films Participant See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 31 minutes Color Color Related news ‘My Name Is Pauli Murray’: Documentary Celebrating An Unsung Champion Of Race And Gender Equity Nov 3Hollywood Insider - Substance & Meaningful Entertainment Amazon Studios Continues ‘Voices’ Program with Native American Heritage Month Celebration (Exclusive) Nov 3Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was My Name Is Pauli Murray (2021) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
