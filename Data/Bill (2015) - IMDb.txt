It was captured 'in camera', using a Victorian stage technique called 'Pepper's Ghost': Jim Howick's performance was reflected onto a sheet of angled glass, positioned in front of the camera, while Mat Baynton performed behind the glass. Goofs Sir Francis Walsingham died in 1590, three years before the events of the film (This is presumably why various characters react to his appearance by saying they thought he was dead). Quotes Christopher Marlowe: Saying things in a short snappy way instead of a long drawn-out way is the soul of wit Bill Shakespeare: You mean brevity? Christopher Marlowe: Yeah Connections Featured in Projector: Miss You Already/Bill (2015) Soundtracks Mortal Coil/Court Scene Written by Bernard Hughes Lute by Chorodophony Percussion by Robert Millet Recorder, Rauschpfeife & Natural Trumpet by Adrian Woodward Double Bass by Lucy Shaw User reviews30 Review Top review 7/10 Surprisingly good I have just watched this movie on Amazon Prime. I had never heard of it but it was free to view so I thought I would give it a try. I ended up watching it till the end (plus the credits) and really enjoyed it. It was amusing rather than funny but I laughed out loud a few times. It is a bit silly so is not recommended if you like serious films. However, if you like Monty Python and Blackadder you should like this film. I will not say anything about the story as if you are reading this you are obviously on IMDb so will probably have read the plot and a few other reviews. It is definitely worth watching and surprisingly good. More so if you are from the UK as other nationalities will miss a lot of the jokes and humour. It is also full of quotes from Shakespeare, Easter Eggs and at least one reference to a certain science fiction movie. helpful•6 0 diadectes58 Nov 19, 2017 Details Edit Release date September 18, 2015 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Official site BBC Films (United Kingdom) Language English Also known as Билл Filming locations York Minster, Deangate, York, North Yorkshire, England, UK Production companies BBC Films Cowboy Films Punk Cinema See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross worldwide $896,929 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 34 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 2.39 : 1 Related news Bill & Ted 3 Throwback Teaser Celebrates 6 Month Countdown to Face the Music Feb 21MovieWeb Alex Winter Finds His Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure Photos from 1989 and They're Awesome Feb 19MovieWeb Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Bill (2015) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
