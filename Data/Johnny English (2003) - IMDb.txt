Only one spy is left and is now Britain's last hope. Johnny English and his sidekick, Bough have been assigned the case of investigating the theft of the British Crown Jewels. The prime suspect is a mysterious French entrepreneur, known as Pascal Sauvage. English and Bough soon find out the horrifying truth behind the theft and Sauvage, but it's not going to be an easy job to bring him to justice. —FilmFanUK queen elizabeth ii characterslapstick comedylooking at oneself in a mirrorcharacter name as titletied feet140 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Stor biograf-success! (Huge cinema-success!) [Danish] Genres Action Adventure Comedy Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG for comic nudity, some crude humor and language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The car that Johnny English used was an Aston Martin DB7 Vantage, which was actually Rowan Atkinson's own car. Goofs Why are Klein and Vendetta still in the garage next to the Tower of London the following morning? It would seem prudent to make a very quick getaway indeed after stealing the Crown Jewels. Quotes Pegasus: It's an unmitigated disaster, English. Johnny English: I couldn't agree more, sir. Pegasus: Well, we need to get these jewels back, English, and fast. Now tell me about this assailant. Because when they searched the room later, there was no sign of him. Johnny English: Well, the man was clearly a professional. He must have escaped while the Queen was being sedated. Pegasus: But he's the only lead we've got, English. We have to find him. Now, come in. This is - This is Roger from Data Support. Please sit down. He'll produce a likeness based on your description. So tell us, what did this man look like? Johnny English: Um... Well... He was... big. Roger: Hair colour? Johnny English: [He looks round the room and spots a bowl of fruit] Um... orange. Pegasus: Orange? Johnny English: Mmm. And curly. Well, frizzy, actually. Frizzy sort of thing. Roger: Frizzy. Johnny English: An eye patch. Broken nose. Very few teeth. Two, I would say at the most. And a scar on his cheek in the shape... of a banana. Roger: Which cheek? Johnny English: Both cheeks. They sort of met in the middle. Pegasus: Are you sure about this, English? [Pegasus shows him what Roger has done on his computer of the assailant Johnny had described and he gasps] Johnny English: Oh, yes, that's him. An uncanny resemblance. Why, it's just as if he's in the room with us. Crazy credits During the end credits, we see Lorna (who was ejected from English's car in the last scene) landing in a swimming pool. Sitting beside the swimming pool is the strange-looking man that English described to his boss early in the film.

If you're not a Rowan Atkinson fan you will probably be bored. helpful•47 7 MR_Heraclius Feb 21, 2020 FAQ5 What is Johnny English about? Isn't the film's plot similar to another comedy? Does the British monarch really have all the powers mentioned in the film?
