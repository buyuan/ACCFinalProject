Connections Featured in Doctor Who Confidential: Is There Life on Mars? (2009) Soundtracks Doctor Who Theme (uncredited) Written by Ron Grainer Arranged by Murray Gold Performed by BBC National Orchestra of Wales User reviews32 Review Top review Usual dross from RTD. Let's see. Dreadful overbearing background music. Endless running down of corridors to pad out the show. Corny, clumsy dialogue. Terrible wooden acting from most of the incidental characters. Overblown, pointless sentimentality. Shallow, hamfisted attempts at profundity. It ticked every Russell T Davies box and then threw in a really awful robot for good measure, and why is the CGI still so noticeably bad? Can't wait for Moffat to take over, yes RTD should be commended for bringing back the show, but his episodes are invariably the worst it has to offer. He's never been able to write science fiction (and in fact has barely even tried) and I for one certainly won't be missing the soap opera crap he shoehorned into Doctor Who and his formulaic, predictable rubbish like 'Waters of Mars'. helpful•34 156 Scunner Nov 16, 2009 Details Edit Release date November 15, 2009 (United Kingdom) Languages Russian English Filming locations Eden Project, Bodelva, Cornwell, England, UK Production company BBC Wales See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 2 minutes Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
