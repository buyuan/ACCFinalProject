The incident happened blocks away from the filming location. User reviews20 Review Top review 3/10 Lacking in so many ways This movie is about a missing girl. The movie was poorly written and the acting was sub par with the exception of the players of the missing girls parents. There was no 'mystery' the audience could begin to develop their own list of suspects from, no clues, just direct point a to point b to point c story. The actor who played the reporter lacked the ability to speak the English language properly and was obviously NOT a writer, much less a reporter. It says based on actual events, my guess is the author of the screenplay read 3 articles and based the whole movie on a poorly reported story, never digging deeper than what the paper said. Finally the end was ridiculous in that this 2020 movie stated that Polly Klass was still missing. I can't understand why STARZ purchased this terrible movie that had so much unrealized potential. helpful•9 4 LovesBlues Jan 12, 2021 Details Edit Release date February 6, 2021 (Brazil) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Досі тут Filming locations Brooklyn, New York, USA Production company Atelier 44 See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross US & Canada $5,268 Opening weekend US & Canada $3,321 Aug 30, 2020 Gross worldwide $5,268 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 39 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital D-Cinema 96kHz 5.1 Aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 Related news HBO Max announces 45-day theatrical window for Warner Bros films in Europe Oct 5ScreenDaily HBO Max sets theatrical window at 45 days for Warner Bros films in Europe Oct 5ScreenDaily Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Still Here (2020) officially released in Japan in Japanese?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
