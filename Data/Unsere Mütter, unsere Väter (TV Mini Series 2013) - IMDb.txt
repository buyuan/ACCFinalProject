Five friends eager to become heroes in an adventure that will change the face of Europe - and that will forever change them as well. Level-headed, highly decorated officer Wilhelm is off to the eastern front with his younger brother Friedhelm, a sensitive dreamer more interested in literature than warfare. Deeply in love with Wilhelm is Charlotte, a young nurse who looks forward to serving in the Wehrmacht, also on the eastern front. While Greta is a talented singer who longs to become another Marlene Dietrich, her Jewish boyfriend Viktor still cannot convince his parents to leave Germany... Valor and courage come to the fore, but also betrayal - of values, beliefs, humanity. Friedhelm turns into a soulless killing machine... Wilhelm deserts his troops and is court-martialed... Charlotte's Nazi ideology crumbles when she betrays a Jewish nurse helping the German army... Greta obtains papers for Viktor's escape by selling herself to an SS colonel. They and millions of others wanted to be heroes; but none of them could imagine what the war would ultimately do to them and to the rest of the world. —Anonymous world war twoberlin germanygerman jewnazi germanygerman actor playing foreigner30 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Action Drama History War Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The town of Kurchatov is indeed near Kursk but it was founded in 1968 around a nuclear power plant. Connections Featured in The Wright Stuff: Episode #19.85 (2014) User reviews119 Review Top review 9/10 Outstanding Television Being fed the usual US blockbuster TV series makes the viewer numb. Mindless rubbish that is sold to us as a"'Television Event 'is nothing more than marketing hype. But every now and then a quality television film comes along. Generation War is a bright light in an otherwise production line of poor offerings that seem to rate on commercial TV. This film was brilliant in so many ways. From the skillful direction and intriguing storyline to masterful character development, from magnificent set recreations to convincing performances from its actors, this film is a winner. Having an interest in WWII history I would agree that some albeit minor inconsistencies in the retelling of history may be identified. But given that it is entertainment mixed with history it does an outstanding job of closely matching the attitudes and people of the time. Its easy for us to sit back in the 21st Century judging the people and attitudes of those living in a deceitful, cruel and secretive fascist state that was Nazi Germany. But times were different and all people that live through any war (whether good or bad) are in some way adversely affected by it. Generation War showed another side to the WWII story which shows no one is a winner. Needless to say I thoroughly enjoyed this offering from German TV. helpful•73 16 osceola22 Jan 26, 2014 FAQ2 UK & Ireland boxset release Details Edit Release date March 1, 2013 (Germany) Country of origin Germany Official site UFA (Germany) Language German Also known as Generation War Filming locations Paul Wegmann Schule, Zeitz, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany Production companies Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen (ZDF) teamWorx Television & Film Beta Film See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 4 hours 30 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 16 : 9 Related news ‘Babylon Berlin’ Producers X Filme and Beta Film Join Rtl for ‘House of Promises’ (Exclusive) Sep 3Variety Film + TV ‘We Children From Bahnhof Zoo’ Director on Giving Tale of ’70s Youth in Berlin a Contemporary Vibe Apr 9Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Unsere Mütter, unsere Väter (2013) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
