To further replicate the Park City experience I intend to go about three miles from my house, take a bus back to it, and watch all the films with my windows open. As far as the Press access, as with years past, there are often conflicts between what you want to see and when you want to see it, at least the way they’re doing screeners for us. They are also encouraging us to watch everything we really want to watch as a Premiere. We have to “Favorite,” then “Reserve” these tickets. They’ll have limited amount of seats to these, much as you would any premiere in the Park City. If you miss that film you have a second chance the next day to catch the film in a Secondary Screening. You only get 10 of these. So, again, much as Toronto wisely did with their fest it's a limited window. I typically chose Narrative features over Docs, mostly because narrative features tend to be seen by more people and have more cultural resonance than docs, though this is changing. I usually pick the Premieres over everything else because getting into the Premiere category means that your film is good enough to have beaten out, literally, thousands of other movies. With Tabitha Jackson now running the show as Festival Director I’m keen to see what her Premiere category looks like.

Director: Sian Heder | Stars: Emilia Jones, Marlee Matlin, Troy Kotsur, Daniel Durant Votes: 24,651 1/28: 5:00PM - Director Heder has been in Sundance before with TALLULAH in 2016 (where I was fortunate enough to interview her, Elliot Page and Allison Janney) and she's a wonderful light. She's been keeping herself busy on ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK and GLOW so watching how her storytelling has matured with be fascinating. 2. Censor (2021) 84 min | Horror, Mystery 6.0 Rate this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 6/10 X 69 Metascore After viewing a strangely familiar video nasty, Enid, a film censor, sets out to solve the past mystery of her sister's disappearance, embarking on a quest that dissolves the line between fiction and reality. Director: Prano Bailey-Bond | Stars: Niamh Algar, Michael Smiley, Nicholas Burns, Vincent Franklin Votes: 8,617 1/28: 9:00PM. I'm such a wimp. I'm already squirming at the thought of watching this Midnight section selection. But the film stars the intriguing actress Niamh Algar (the android "mother" from RAISED BY WOLVES) and the film is co-writer and director was one of Variety’s "10 Directors to Watch." 3. Cryptozoo (2021) 95 min | Animation 6.5 Rate this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 6.5/10 X 74 Metascore Cryptozookeepers try to capture a Baku, a dream-eating hybrid creature of legend, and start wondering if they should display these beasts or keep them hidden and unknown. Director: Dash Shaw | Stars: Lake Bell, Michael Cera, Emily Davis, Alex Karpovsky Votes: 939 1/29, 2:00PM - Writer/director Shaw was at Toronto in 2016 with his earlier animated effort, MY ENTIRE HIGH SCHOOL SINKING INTO THE SEA. His voice actors here are stellar and include, in all this uniqueness Angeliki Papoulia, the lead actress from DOGTOOTH. Because of course she is. 4. Bring Your Own Brigade (2021) R | 119 min | Documentary 7.2 Rate this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 7.2/10 X 81 Metascore An investigation into our landscape's hidden fire stories and on-the-ground experiences of firefighters and residents struggling through deadly fires. Director: Lucy Walker | Stars: Trina Cunningham, Mike Davis, Don Hankins, Chad Hanson Votes: 190 1/29: 3:00 - If I was stack-ranking these movies, instead of putting them in screening order, this would be my #1 film. And it's entirely because it's done by one of my favorite people in the movie world, Lucy Walker. Yes, the twice-Oscar-nominated Walker. Yes, the maker of THE CRASH REEL, a favorite doc. of mine. 5. In the Earth (2021) R | 107 min | Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller 5.2 Rate this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 5.2/10 X 63 Metascore As the world searches for a cure to a disastrous virus, a scientist and park scout venture deep in the forest for a routine equipment run. Director: Ben Wheatley | Stars: Joel Fry, Reece Shearsmith, Hayley Squires, Ellora Torchia Votes: 5,522 1/29, 6:00. Which Ben Wheatley are we going to get here? A FIELD IN ENGLAND Wheatley? Or the upcoming director of THE MEG 2 Wheatley (actually, I kind of love that he's directing the MEG sequel)? The main image, of a person in shadow, carrying an ax, might mean a bit of both. 6. Fils de plouc (2021) 70 min | Comedy 5.4 Rate this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 5.4/10 X Issachar and Zabulon, two brothers in their twenties, are supremely stupid and never bored, as madness is part of their daily lives. When they lose their mother's beloved dog, they have 24 hours to find it - or she will kick them out. Directors: Harpo Guit, Lenny Guit | Stars: Maxi Delmelle, Harpo Guit, Claire Bodson, Tom Adjibi Votes: 151 1/29, 9:00PM - Another film from the Midnight program this has such a bizarre plot outline but I feel compelled to watch it. Plus the only other thing playing at 9:00 at night is REBEL HEARTS, a documentary about unconventional L.A. nuns (Don't get mad at me, I'm sure it's great and I'll feel terrible about missing it on its Premiere...I'll do a few "Hail Mary's" to make up for it.) 7. Street Gang: How We Got to Sesame Street (2021) PG | 107 min | Documentary, Family, History 8.1 Rate this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 8.1/10 X 82 Metascore Take a stroll down Sesame Street and witness the birth of the most impactful children's series in TV history. From the iconic furry characters to the songs you know by heart, learn how a gang of visionary creators changed our world. Director: Marilyn Agrelo | Stars: Frank Biondo, Linda Bove, Fran Brill, Northern Calloway Votes: 495 1/30, 9:00AM - This will be my fourth "Sesame Street" documentary at Sundance (including BEING ELMO, about Kevin Clash, which didn't age well) because Sundance and I seem to love "Sesame Street." This looks like the definitive origin story so I'm excited to learn more. 8. Prime Time (2021) 93 min | Drama, Thriller 5.2 Rate this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 5.2/10 X On New Year's Eve 1999, an armed man enters a TV studio during a broadcast, takes the host hostage and makes one demand: to give a message live on air. Director: Jakub Piatek | Stars: Bartosz Bielenia, Magdalena Poplawska, Andrzej Klak, Malgorzata Hajewska Votes: 1,568 1/30, 12:00PM - If you didn't get to see deservedly Oscar-nominated CORPUS CHRISTI, please do. Bartosz Bielenia, the mesmerizing lead from that film is also the headliner here, from a first-time director. 9. Passing (I) (2021) PG-13 | 98 min | Drama 6.6 Rate this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 6.6/10 X 83 Metascore "Passing" follows the unexpected reunion of two high school friends, whose renewed acquaintance ignites a mutual obsession that threatens both of their carefully constructed realities. Director: Rebecca Hall | Stars: Tessa Thompson, Ruth Negga, André Holland, Bill Camp Votes: 4,044 1/30, 3:00PM - Rebecca Hall is an actress that I've always found to be witty and detailed. This is her directorial debut. Plus What A Cast (WAC). 10. Eight for Silver (2021) 113 min | Horror 5.9 Rate this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 5.9/10 X 57 Metascore In rural 19th-century France, a mysterious, possibly supernatural menace threatens a small village. John McBride, a pathologist, comes to town to investigate the danger -- and exorcise some of his own demons in the process. Director: Sean Ellis | Stars: Boyd Holbrook, Kelly Reilly, Alistair Petrie, Roxane Duran Votes: 251 1/30, 6:00PM - Ellis directed the ambitious ANTHROPOID. Both Reilly and Holbrook have been favorites of mine for a while now. Hope this works. 11. A Glitch in the Matrix (2021) 108 min | Documentary 5.2 Rate this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 5.2/10 X 62 Metascore Documentary filmmaker Rodney Ascher tackles the question "are we living in a simulation?" with testimony, philosophical evidence and scientific explanation in his quest for the answer. Director: Rodney Ascher | Stars: Nick Bostrom, Joshua Cooke, Erik Davis, Philip K. Dick Votes: 1,510 1/30, 9:00PM - Intriguing concept and the other premiere is about "ruthless drifters" and I've had enough of those in real life, thanks. 12. A Nuvem Rosa (2021) R | 105 min | Drama 6.1 Rate this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 6.1/10 X After a toxic and mysterious pink cloud appeared, Giovana finds herself stuck in a flat with a man she just met, changing her life in a way she never expected. Director: Iuli Gerbase | Stars: Renata de Lélis, Eduardo Mendonça, Helena Becker, Girley Paes Votes: 364 1/30 Alternate (we have the day, essentially, to watch this if we change our mind) I said last year that apocalyptic movies have a tough time at Sundance...and then I saw SAVE YOURSELVES!. This film looks much more somber than that lark. 13. Rita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go for It (2021) PG-13 | 90 min | Documentary, Biography 7.7 Rate this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 7.7/10 X 79 Metascore A look at the life and work of Rita Moreno from her humble beginnings in Puerto Rico to her success on Broadway and in Hollywood. Director: Mariem Pérez Riera | Stars: Morgan Freeman, Marlon Brando, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Rita Moreno Votes: 468 1/30 Alternate (we have the day, essentially, to watch this if we change our mind) I had a chance to see Rita Moreno in concert. I sat next to a senior. After she amazed us for two hours, regaling 14. Marvelous and the Black Hole (2021) 81 min | Comedy 7.8 Rate this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 7.8/10 X A teenage delinquent teams up with a surly children's party magician to navigate her dysfunctional family and inner demons. Director: Kate Tsang | Stars: Miya Cech, Rhea Perlman, Leonardo Nam, Kannon Votes: 1,484 1/31, 9:00AM - Sundance has a mixed history with these kind of quirky team-ups (THE WACKNESS comes back to me from 2008, just to annoy me) but, again, this is a Premiere film. 15. Together Together (2021) R | 90 min | Comedy 6.5 Rate this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 6.5/10 X 70 Metascore When a young loner becomes the gestational surrogate for a single man in his 40s, the two strangers come to realize this unexpected relationship will challenge their perceptions of connection, boundaries and the particulars of love. Director: Nikole Beckwith | Stars: Patti Harrison, Ed Helms, Rosalind Chao, Timm Sharp Votes: 4,631 1/31, 12:00PM - I include this because, whenever I was talking to someone from Sundance, including the demonstrations on how to use the ticketing service this title kept being used as an example. "So, say you want to see TOGETHER TOGETHER..." I think it's subliminal. Plus I like Ed Helms. 16. Jockey (2021) R | 94 min | Drama 6.6 Rate this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 6.6/10 X 79 Metascore An aging jockey aims for a final championship, when a rookie rider arrives claiming to be his son. Director: Clint Bentley | Stars: Clifton Collins Jr., Moises Arias, Molly Parker, Logan Cormier Votes: 166 1/31, 3:00PM, - Three actors I respect: Cliff Collins Jr., Molly Parker and Moises Arias from a first time director. These are the kinds of films that can make Sundance sing. 17. Prisoners of the Ghostland (2021) 103 min | Action, Sci-Fi, Thriller 4.2 Rate this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 4.2/10 X 53 Metascore A notorious criminal must break an evil curse in order to rescue an abducted girl who has mysteriously disappeared.

Director: Erin Vassilopoulos | Stars: Alessandra Mesa, Ani Mesa, Pico Alexander, Jake Hoffman Votes: 143 1/31, 9:00PM - Alternate - Vassilopoulos based this feature on his short of the same name from 2016. While some of the results of these heavily-work-shopped Sundance films don't actually work and can't be shopped around sometimes they are honed films, with a considered finesse to them. 19. La nuit des rois (2020) R | 93 min | Drama, Fantasy 6.6 Rate this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 6.6/10 X 82 Metascore A young man is sent to "La Maca", a prison of Ivory Coast in the middle of the forest ruled by its prisoners. With the red moon rising, he is designated by the Boss to be the new "Roman" and must tell a story to the other prisoners. Director: Philippe Lacôte | Stars: Bakary Koné, Steve Tientcheu, Jean Cyrille Digbeu, Rasmané Ouédraogo Votes: 1,973 2/1, 3:00PM - So, someone at Sundance realized that 2/1 is a Monday and some people have other work to do. Thus this film and BLACKJUDAS are the only Narrative Premieres scheduled for today. I hope to catch JUDAS another way. 20. Misha and the Wolves (2021) PG-13 | 90 min | Documentary, Drama 6.6 Rate this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 6.6/10 X 63 Metascore Misha and the Wolves is the dramatic tale of a woman whose holocaust memoir took the world by storm, but a fallout with her publisher - who turned detective - revealed an audacious deception created to hide a darker truth. Director: Sam Hobkinson | Stars: Misha Defonseca, Laura Liberatore, Candy O'Terry Votes: 1,515 2/1, Alternate (we have the day, essentially, to watch this if we change our mind) - I think we're all struggling with the fabulists of the world. What motivates them? This doc looks utterly fascinating. 21. We're All Going to the World's Fair (2021) 86 min | Drama, Horror 6.1 Rate this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 6.1/10 X 78 Metascore Alone in her attic bedroom, teenager Casey becomes immersed in an online role-playing horror game, wherein she begins to document the changes that may or may not be happening to her. Director: Jane Schoenbrun | Stars: Anna Cobb, Holly Anne Frink, Michael J Rogers Votes: 182 2/1, Alternate (we have the day, essentially, to watch this if we change our mind) I don't have any other films from the NEXT section at Sundance (which programs the alternative films that just wouldn't play well with a general audience. Shoenbrun is a 1st time director. 22. The World to Come (2020) R | 105 min | Drama, Romance 6.2 Rate this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 6.2/10 X 73 Metascore Somewhere along the mid-19th century American East Coast frontier, two neighboring couples battle hardship and isolation, witnessed by a splendid yet testing landscape, challenging them both physically and psychologically. Director: Mona Fastvold | Stars: Katherine Waterston, Vanessa Kirby, Casey Affleck, Christopher Abbott Votes: 6,090 2/2, 12:00PM, I'll just quote the Sundance guide here for my reasons: "Mona Fastvold’s rugged period romance, The World to Come, is adapted from Jim Shepard's 2017 short story of the same name and premiered in competition at the Venice International Film Festival." 23. Cusp (2021) 92 min | Documentary 6.5 Rate this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 6.5/10 X In the lazy days of a Texas summer, three teenage girls navigate friendship, relationships, and toxic masculinity as they make the transition to the adult world. Directors: Isabel Bethencourt, Parker Hill Votes: 87 Going to figure out if I can fit this in: There's a LAST PICTURE SHOW feel to the image provided for this doc. That's enough for me. 24. I Was a Simple Man (2021) 100 min | Drama 6.4 Rate this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 6.4/10 X A family in Hawai'i faces the imminent death of their eldest as the ghosts of the past haunt the countryside. Director: Christopher Makoto Yogi | Stars: Steve Iwamoto, Constance Wu, Tim Chiou, Kanoa Goo Votes: 97 Going to figure out if I can fit this in: This movie. Right here. Know nothing about it. But maybe it's WHALE RIDER or MINARI or PALM SPRINGS. 25. Mayday (2021) 100 min | Drama, Fantasy, Mystery 4.2 Rate this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 4.2/10 X 45 Metascore Ana is transported to a dreamlike and dangerous land where she joins an army of girls engaged in a never-ending war. Though she finds strength in this exhilarating world, she realizes that she's not the killer they want her to be. Director: Karen Cinorre | Stars: Grace Van Patten, Mia Goth, Soko, Havana Rose Liu Votes: 632 Going to figure out if I can fit this in: A gothy/fantasy movie in the main competition? Must be good. 25 titles Follow Us On Twitter Clear your history Recently Viewed Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App View Full Site Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
