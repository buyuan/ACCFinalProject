Connections Featured in The Big Fat Quiz of the Year (2011) User reviews37 Review Top review 7/10 Relatability on an international scale! This show reminds me of a much wittier, much dirtier version of Apatow's 'Undeclared'. I found this show from looking into the shows related to The Inbetweeners, which I always found cheesy but extremely watchable. I found out Joe Thomas (Simon Cooper in Inbetweers) was in this college comedy and I became intrigued. Then, I watched a few episodes and I was sold. This is one of the better college comedy shows that has come around in a while, and considering how deep on the net I had to dig to find out about it, I am sure it is massively under-watched in the U.S. Hopefully it gets up on Netflix or something so it can get some recognition over here. There are plenty of cliché situations, but these are clichés because they truly do tend to happen to everyone who attends college, whether in the U.S. or the U.K or wherever. I love the unique blending of characters and the filter-less nature of the dialogue. Anyone in college, recently graduated, or seeking some nostalgia should have no problem relating to the relationship drama, the wit, the parties, and the sense of confusion which naturally arise from throwing a bunch of young people into one small area (be it the college on a larger scale, or the house/dorm on a smaller one). helpful•21 9 AMichaelL Jan 11, 2012 Details Edit Release date September 21, 2011 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Language English Also known as Свеже месо Filming locations Manchester, Greater Manchester, England, UK Production companies Lime Pictures Objective Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 50 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news Inside Out 2Slgbtq+ Film Festival Announces International Recipients Of The 2021 Re: Focus Fund Oct 27Deadline Film + TV ‘Succession’s Jesse Armstrong On The Dangers Of Creating Unsavoury Characters: “You Have To Be Careful” – Lff Oct 16Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Spanish language plot outline for Fresh Meat (2011)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
