Genres Action Drama Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Some scenes which take place in the Firehouse 51 kitchen are filmed in the actual firehouse kitchen, others are filmed on a studio set. If you see a door to the left of the cooking area, that is the studio set; if you see a drinking fountain, that's the actual firehouse. Goofs Most departments, Chicago FD included, do not allow firefighters on duty to grow out facial hair on the cheeks or on the lower lip or chin as Lt. Severide often does. It interferes with achieving a tight seal on the SCBA (air) mask as the seal gasket on the rests against those parts of the face. Firefighters with too much facial hair will also fail the mask fit test for the same reason. Mustaches (as often seen on Chief Boden, Mouch, Otis and some others) are not technically an issue, but some departments may have internal regulations that restrict them. Connections Featured in Maya & Marty: Jimmy Fallon & Miley Cyrus (2016) User reviews190 Review Top review I hate dawson A good entertaining show, I like the characters in it, it's not slow and just easy watching. However, why does Dawson get so much airtime? I hate the character, I can't connect to her and she just seems to be in places or meetings for the sake of it, she should just be a side character, give Mouch and Herrman more airtime as they are actually interesting characters that seem realistic and likeable. helpful•16 4 kieranjameskj Apr 18, 2019 Details Edit Release date October 10, 2012 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Пожежники Чикаго Filming locations Cinespace Chicago Film Studios, Chicago, Illinois, USA Production companies Wolf Films Universal Television See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 43 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news Cancelled or Renewed?
