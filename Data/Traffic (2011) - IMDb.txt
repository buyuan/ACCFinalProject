Connections Remade as Chennaiyil Oru Naal (2013) User reviews12 Review Top review 10/10 Great team Work ! The movie goes extremely well on human relationships. Mother- son,Father-son,husband-wife,lover-lover,friend-friend. This was really a first time feel in Malayalam movie industry! All the professional characters in their role was up to the best. The doctors,Police , etc have done such a great experience to the viewers. One thing which we can miss is all about the background music and effects, which made us clinch with the thriller mood. Especially all songs were Emotional and require for the plot. All roles have their own importance which never makes the viewer feel bored ! Great Screenplay and Direction. A great successive thriller from the start to end ! helpful•0 0 manojcmm May 9, 2015 Details Edit Release date January 7, 2011 (India) Country of origin India Language Malayalam Also known as Траффик Filming locations Cochin, Ernakulam, Kerala, India Production company Magic Frames See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 2 hours 2 minutes Color Color Related news Traffic team hosts a special screening for cops May 4BollywoodHungama Jimmy Shergill in Traffic Second poster May 4Bollyspice Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Traffic (2011) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Most anticipated Indian movies and shows Percentage shows amount of top page views. 1Marakkar: Lion of the Arabian Sea38.3% 2Ram Asur23.2% 3Bunty Aur Babli 28.7% 4RRR6.5% 5Antim: The Final Truth5.5% 6Pushpa: The Rise - Part 14.1% 7Satyameva Jayate 23.9% 8Matsya Kaand3.8% 9Minnal Murali3.2% 10Dangerous2.8% Updates approximately every 20 minutes.
