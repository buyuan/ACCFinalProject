Political commentary of the 1930's comes to full-circle-relevance for our current time, against the joyously-romantic visuals of cinema's golden age. Oldman is delightful; the sharp-tongued dialogue elevates the piece. Technique delivers everything you'd expect from Fincher. A captivating time-capsule romantic period study. My 2020 best picture pick bar none. See more▼See less▲ Streets of Blood (2009) So Frustrating! 24 November 2019 - 2 out of 2 users found this review helpful. This movie left me bewildered and frustrated as all hell! The story had all the makings of a great corrupt cop picture. In the hands of a worthwhile director it might have even been worthy of a theatrical release. The talent was all there. The location and story were there as well. The director of photography should be charged with a crime for making the picture look like an eight year old with ADHD and a handycam shot it! This absolutely ruined everything from the start, and was distracting and throughout. Surprisingly, about half-way in, everything starts to click, the imagery is less annoying, and the story comes together. The director is horribly inept, but somehow they completed the picture. I feel bad for everyone involved watching the finished product. They also must have seen a vision in a worthwhile script, which was ultimately devastated by the hacks at Millennium Films, and the talentless director. So frustrating.
