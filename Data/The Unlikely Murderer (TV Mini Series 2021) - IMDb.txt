What do we know about Stig Engström? How could the police let him get away, despite being on his track? The murder was not planned well, Engström did everything wrong from the beginning and almost no one believed his lies about what he actually did during that fateful night 1986 in Stockholm, Sweden. 1980syear 1986murdermurdererreal crime15 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Crime Drama Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia Robert Gustafsson, who plays the starring role in this series, was in real life at the same cinema screening as the prime minister, just minutes before the assassination. User reviews23 Review Top review Nebbish yes; but like the guilty Lee Harvey Oswald, or the innocent Richard Jewel? I was working in nearby Denmark when Palme was murdered. I'm not an expert at all but I have followed the news coverage of case then and all along. I think the Swedish authorities and Swedish and general European press were caught up in the same kind of cognitive bias as occurred with Oswald, which was the core of fueling the conspiracy theories. To wit: How could Engstrom, this meaningless, pipsqueek, this nebbish, be the mover of such a large effect event? In the case of Oswald the evidence was so overwhelming. In the case of Engström the evidence was ignored because the press and much of the Swedish authorities were looking for a conspiracy. (It turns out to not be even poltical at all.) One would think the Nordic press would be staid and sober but the investigative journalists there were pumping every wild conspiracy theory including the absurd idea that the CIA was responsible. And the guy who was there, on the scene, had known access to handguns (rifles are/were common in Scandavian countries but pistols were NOT). He did not have an credible alibi. And he had a motive (a lifetime of insignificance and now being famous/hero). I brought up Richard Jewel (falsely accused by FBI of 1996 Atlanta Olympics bombing) , whom the US FBI destroyed, vilifying even after they knew he was innocent, because that was the opposite wing of the pendulum on the nebbish perpetrator. Jewel (like Engstrom) did have some inconsistences in his story, but those were from FBI high pressure, an unethical tactics with the problem ridden Clinton Attorney General Janet Reno wanting to close up the case without regard to doing it right. In that case FBI "profiling", which has failed countless times, including spectacularly during Unibomber, fit Jewel perfectly (and incorrectly) as a nebbish guy. Even though all the remaining evidence indicated he was innocent. "The Unlikely Murderer" touches upon some of the most glaring screw-ups by the Swedish Authorities, but in my view does not do so nearly enough. This was a grand decades long sustained investigative cluster#&!k. Event the title is ironic, since, with the evidence Swedish authorities had within weeks of Palme's killing, it was clear that Engstom was NOT an "unlikely" assassin at all but quite likely As a TV min-series I give this 5/10 as it is pretty mediocre and while critical, not nearly critical enough, of the Keystone cops running the successive investigations. Overall the pacing seems to contain a lot of filler and this could have been done in half the amount of screen time. I am sure I will be marked as "unhelpful" by the conspiracy theorists still clinging to the disinformation spread by the KGB (and acknowledged as KGB generated nonsense by defectors), but there is no convincing of some people. helpful•30 15 random-70778 Nov 5, 2021 Details Edit Release date November 5, 2021 (Sweden) Country of origin Sweden Official site Official Netflix Language Swedish Also known as القاتل المُريب Filming locations Tunnelgatan, Norrmalm, Stockholm, Stockholms län, Sweden Production companies FLX Netflix See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 3 hours 48 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Letterbox Related news New on Netflix: November 2021 Releases Nov 1Den of Geek New On Netflix For November 2021: Day-By-Day Listings For TV Series, Movies & More Oct 26Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What was the official certification given to The Unlikely Murderer (2021) in Japan?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
