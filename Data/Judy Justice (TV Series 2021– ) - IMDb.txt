She is accompanied by a cast consisting of a law clerk, court stenographer and bailiff. judgemanhattanfamily courtcourt stenographerlaw clerk5 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genre Reality-TV Parents guide Add content advisory User reviews57 Review Top review 4/10 Went downhill with this attempt She had a winning formula on Judge Judy. Now, it's so bland and watered down. She even went so far as to stick her granddaughter on stage as a prop, to giggle at the right times. And no Byrd? Judge Judy did him wrong by tossing him aside. This new iteration of "Judy" misses the mark and not by a little. helpful•18 7 steveniemi-89906 Nov 2, 2021 Details Edit Release date November 1, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Filming locations KTLA Studios - 5858 Sunset Blvd., Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, USA Production company Amazon Studios See more company credits at IMDbPro Related news Judy Justice Review – Same Gig With Odd Twists – Bonkers Byrd Exit Nov 2AreYouScreening.com Judy Justice: What's Your Verdict on Judge Judy's New Show?
