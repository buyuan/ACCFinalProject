Simin prefers to live abroad to provide better opportunities for their only daughter, Termeh. However, Nader refuses to go because he thinks he must stay in Iran and take care of his father (Ali-Asghar Shahbazi), who suffers from Alzheimers. However, Simin is determined to get a divorce and leave the country with her daughter. —Amin Davoodi divorcealzheimer's diseasemarital problemcourtstairway215 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Ugly truth, sweet lies Genre Drama Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for mature thematic material Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Director Asghar Farhadi's first idea for the movie was the image of a man washing his father, who had Alzheimer's. He built the rest of the film around that scene. Goofs Although Razieh had gone to the doctor to see if her baby is still alive a few hours before she was beaten by Nader, the judge never asked her about the result of medical check. Also after medical examination, it should be clear for Razieh to know about the situation of her baby unless she couldn't reach the doctor at the time. Quotes Simin: Does he even realize you are his son? Nader: I know he is my father! Connections Featured in Ebert Presents: At the Movies: Episode #2.12 (2011) User reviews411 Review Top review 9/10 you will be "awed" in amazement THROUGHOUT! I'll just get to the point, if you are previewing for something to watch, there is no way you can play the 1st 3 minutes of this film and stop. It hooks you straight in, and for me, I LOVE that in films. the story is just AMAZING, and the way it's portrayed, the director makes sure you are following behind with EVERY MINUTE OF THE FILM, as it unwinds. the casting is just brilliant, as if they were just born to play this film and then die. they achieve in captivating the emotion of the story VERY well. EVERY SINGLE ACTOR int this film did a great job. what's even more amazing, it's how low budget this film is (300K us$). as a conclusion; 3 good things about this film; (1) the story-line, well written and well scripted (2) the cast, well selected, and amazing acting (3) the setting, and the lack of a score!
