Over five episodes the group are shown living through an entire decade until 1991, as they become determined to live fiercely despite the threat HIV poses to them. —peterjmalone aidsgay manapostrophe in series titlecontraction in series titlefriendship22 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Comedy Drama History Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The character of Jill is based on actress Jill Nalder, a long-term friend of writer Russell T. Davies. She plays Jill's mother in the series, and had genuinely lived in a Hampstead flatshare christened the Pink Palace. A theatrical "La!" was a common callout amongst the friends. Connections Featured in Jeremy Vine: Episode #4.20 (2021) User reviews376 Review Top review 9/10 Eye opening I watched this and was shocked at how brothers, sons were treaded in the 80's and 90's for being ill. The writing and screen play was brilliant. This can be a little graphic, but that paints a picture. Doesn't matter what you believe or think, everyone deserves love. This is the type of thing we should have seen at school rather than Philadelphia. Time to accept and love one another. helpful•89 20 mrjdarcher Jan 23, 2021 FAQ1 When will it be released in the US?
