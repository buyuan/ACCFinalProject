Cleric John Preston (Bale) is a top ranking government agent responsible for destroying those who resist the rules. When he misses a dose of Prozium, a mind-altering drug that hinders emotion, Preston, who has been trained to enforce the strict laws of the new regime, suddenly becomes the only person capable of overthrowing it. —Anonymous dystopiasuppression of emotiongun fulawbrainwashing313 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines In the near future, Freedom is a thing of the past. Genres Action Drama Sci-Fi Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for violence Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Despite popular belief, absolutely no wires were used in the film at all. All of the gravity-defying stunts were done through conventional means. For example, the backflip off of the motorcycle was done with a trampoline. Goofs After the raid on a sense offender's hideout, Preston takes off his gloves and touches a wall, during which he finds a bullet hole which reveals a stream of light coming through, hinting a hidden room on the other side. However, when he enters this room, no lights are on and it is pitch black. Quotes Partridge: You always knew. [begins to read from Yeats] Partridge: "But I, being poor, have only my dreams. I have spread my dreams under your feet. Tread softly because you tread on my dreams." I assume you dream, Preston. Connections Edited into Honest Trailers: Lord of the Rings (2012) Soundtracks Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Op. 125: I. Allegro ma non troppo, un poco maestoso Composed by Ludwig van Beethoven User reviews1.2K Review Top review 9/10 Criminally underrated dystopian effort A strong film with plenty to recommend it, EQUILIBRIUM was released to the noise of "not another MATRIX rip-off" and similar sentiments. This instant decision is a little unfair, because – although obviously inspired by the Keanu Reeves blockbuster in places – EQUILIBRIUM is a decent and intelligent science fiction thriller with a pleasing change of pace. Once again we're in an Orwellian style future of grab greys and mundane apartment-block buildings, where emotion is suppressed and evil henchmen in motorbike helmets go around shooting little dogs. In this world we meet Christian Bale, a martial arts superhero who goes around murdering all those emotional and artistic folks. Sure, it's an old story, but it works well here. CGI cityscapes aside, there are no fancy special effects robots or monsters; instead the basis is on good old-fashioned characters, and with a supporting cast that includes Sean Pertwee, Sean Bean, Taye Diggs, William Fichtner, and Emily Watson; you can't go wrong. Much of the story is predictable and there are a couple of sappy moments, but for the most part this is suspenseful, exciting stuff. A handful of violent, ultra-stylish action sequences (displaying originality, even in this day and age) add to the impact and help make the underlying dreariness rather enjoyable. Very entertaining viewing that deserves to be given a chance. A lot of this works thanks to Bale; once again, he's excellent in the part. I'd go so far as to say that this is actually better than THE MATRIX; whereas that film was all action, this one makes you think in a moral sense, and the action supports the story – rather than the action being the story. helpful•9 0 Leofwine_draca Jul 7, 2016 FAQ2 What is the infamous "gun swap" plot hole?
