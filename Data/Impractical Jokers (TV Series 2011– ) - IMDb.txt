Every time they fail to complete a task, the joker will receive a red thumbs-down. The joker with the most thumbs down after the series of challenges is the loser who must complete an extremely embarrassing or difficult task and cannot refuse to try it. These Loser Challenges have consisted of dangerous stunts and some scary scenes. —Sam Sneddon hidden cameranon fiction Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines They have to SAY it. They have to DO it. You have to SEE it. Genres Comedy Reality-TV Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia In a Reddit AMA, Sal said he has been physically assaulted two times: A woman slapped him for telling her that her baby was ugly, and a shell-shocked war vet choked him for cutting in line. Quotes Narrator: Warning, this show contains scenes of graphic stupidity among four lifelong friends who compete to embarrass each other. Viewer Discretion is advised. Crazy credits Beginning in season 3, a new intro was used that had each of the Jokers interacting around New York City. The intro concluded with all four Jokers standing against a rail protecting the Hudson River. Alternate versions Some current reruns have some small scenes cut out and music has been changed on some episodes, as well. Connections Featured in Late Night with Seth Meyers: Matthew Broderick/John Cena/Impractical Jokers/Jimmy Chamberlin (2015) User reviews162 Review Top review 10/10 Entertaining as hell I'm not usually one to fall for a simple laugh. But these four friends remind me so much of the guys I hang out with, I can't get enough. Off the wall, who can make who do the most zany public display of insanity. It cracks me up. These four guys, who really have been friends since grade school it turns out, challenge each other each week to see who is willing to do the most crazy embarrassing thing in public. Usually one of them has an earpiece while the other three friends are feeding them instructions. If the friend with the earpiece doesn't do what they tell him to, he loses that round. At the end of the show, whoever has the most losses, has to do something EXTREMELY embarrassing. I watched the 'best of' where they actually interviewed these guys and that's when I became a real fan, because it started out just the four of them doing this without a camera. Glad they started filming, because it's really funny. helpful•61 8 robbiestokes13 Mar 22, 2012 Details Edit Release date December 15, 2011 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Official Facebook Official Instagram Language English Also known as Mission: Uncomfortable Production company NorthSouth Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 30 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news Toronto Premiere ‘Silent Land’ Scores French Deal With The Jokers Sep 10Deadline Film + TV New Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Movie Is Happening at Paramount with the Jost Brothers Aug 2MovieWeb Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Brazilian Portuguese language plot outline for Impractical Jokers (2011)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
