When the boys mother (Angela Dixon, Never Let Go) leaves her sons with their Speedway racer father for a trip back to San Francisco, their 'old school' dad disapproves of their time on devices and instead reminds them of the exhilaration or real life adventure. A twist of fate leads the boys to uncover the diamond theft but in the process gets their father arrested for the crime. A race against time ensues. Can these boys use their dad's training to get him out of jail in time for his Speedway race. With twists, turns, laughs and outrageously fun plot, Adventure Boyz aims not only to entertain the whole family, but remind us all of the thrills and adventure we can all have away from a device. speedwaymotorbikeracingbmxkids3 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Leave your device aside and get out there!

It is such a beautiful film set in the stunning countryside in Eastbourne. It is a kids' adventure story full of fun and excitement. It's definitely a must-see film for all the family! helpful•3 0 natasha-marburger-517-431101 Mar 12, 2020 Details Edit Release date July 20, 2019 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Official site Official Site Language English Filming locations England, UK Production company Latitude Films See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 33 minutes Color Color Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Adventure Boyz (2019) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
