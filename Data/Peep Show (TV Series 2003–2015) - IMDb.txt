Genre Comedy Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia With very few exceptions (and apart from establishing shots of locations at the beginning of scenes) every shot is from a character's point of view (as if the viewer is seeing things through their eyes). Also, every single scene features either Mark or Jeremy, if not both. Connections Featured in Untitled 'Peep Show' Documentary (2005) Soundtracks Flagpole Sitta (theme Series 2-) Written by Aaron Huffman, Jeff Lin, Sean Nelson, and Evan Sult Performed by Harvey Danger User reviews102 Review Top review Top Stuff! An utterly, blindingly funny show from Channel 4 (which was put out on E4, for some reason. Why do they do that? ) It is a terrible shame that more people can't see it. If you like shows like Bottom, BlackAdder, Fifteen Stories High, etc., you'll love this. (Its adult content, however, may preclude less prurient viewers from concurring.) Brief summary: the camera acts alternately as either of the central characters in this show - hence the title. They are both deeply flawed individuals, unable to grasp the causal origins of their unmitigated life-failure, let alone find the inner resources to affect any solution. The show is really about pain - and you won't enjoy it unless you are quite capable of laughing at your own. Can't praise its originality enough. 10/10. helpful•74 6 spungonet Jul 18, 2004 FAQ3 What does Jeremy live on? Do Mitchell and Webb write "Peep Show"? Will there be any more seasons of Peep Show?
