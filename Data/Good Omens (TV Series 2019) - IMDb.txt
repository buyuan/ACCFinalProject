Genres Comedy Fantasy Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia According to Neil Gaiman, co-author Terry Pratchett's last request to him before his death in 2015 was for Neil to write the screen adaptation. Previous attempts to bring the book to television failed due to not being able to find a writer able to adapt the book while keeping its spirit and humor. Connections Featured in The IMDb Show: Take 5 With Mireille Enos (2019) Soundtracks You're My Best Friend Performed by Queen User reviews604 Review Top review 8/10 Brilliant casting, thoroughly enjoyable - from a true fan of the original So, I've read Good Omens at least 10 times over my lifetime, and I can honestly say that this mini series does the book justice. The casting is just amazing, David Tennant and Michael Sheen are both brilliant, Adria Arjona was inspired casting for Anathema Device. Sergeant Shadwell was just as I imagined him. Really loved every minute of it, I was only sad that it ended. It really does capture the spirit of the book. it's not often that an adaptation is this faithful to the source material, but this was really spot on. Honestly I could watch Crowley and Aziraphale for another hundred hours. Just some fantastic moments between the two of them. helpful•52 19 sethreardon Jun 29, 2019 FAQ2 Where was this filmed?
