User reviews25 Review Top review 8/10 Above average police procedural Definitely a better than usual police drama. Some good acting and the time shifts could be confusing but it kept your interest throughout. Particularly liked the realism of the ending. helpful•6 5 phippysma Nov 11, 2021 Details Edit Release date November 8, 2021 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Production companies Independent Television (ITV) Mammoth Screen Windhover Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Related news The week in TV: The Shrink Next Door; Inside the Care Crisis With Ed Balls; Beat the Devil; The Tower Nov 14The Guardian - TV News BritBox Picks Up North American Rights To ITV’s ‘The Tower’ Starring ‘Game Of Thrones” Gemma Whelan Nov 4Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was The Tower (2021) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
