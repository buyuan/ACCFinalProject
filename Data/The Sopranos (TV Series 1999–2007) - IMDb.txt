We see Tony at work, at home, and in therapy. Moments of black comedy intersperse this aggressive, adult drama, with adult language, and extreme violence. —ahmetkozan violencemafiapsychiatristcheating husbandcult tv186 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Made in America. (season 6, part 2) Genres Crime Drama Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia After the pilot aired, a real-life "wise guy" told James Gandolfini never to wear shorts again. The encounter seems to have been incorporated into season four, episode one, "For All Debts Public and Private", when New York City mob boss Carmine tells Tony that he'd heard about his recent backyard party, and that "a don doesn't wear shorts." Goofs In the episode "Pine Barrens" in Season 3, Paulie is seen pumping his own gas. All gas stations in New Jersey are "full-serve," meaning that only gas station attendants are permitted to pump gas. Quotes Anthony 'Tony' Soprano Sr.: More is lost by indecision than wrong decision. Alternate versions In January 2007, US network A&E began airing the edited-for-syndication reruns of the show. Scenes featuring nudity, sexual activity and violence were replaced with alternate versions or were excised completely. The profanity was dubbed over.

User reviews724 Review Top review 9/10 How Could You Not? Take note streaming producers, this is how you make a television show. Storytelling of this nature is meant to be confrontational and not play into making a statement. Watching this again on a streaming service, certainly makes me appreciate how great this is. Which to be honest I didn't truly appreciate it the first time around. If you don't like the gangster/wise guys narrative, move along. helpful•13 0 swordsnare Jul 3, 2021 FAQ11 Is Tony really a sociopath? What is the title of the theme song?
