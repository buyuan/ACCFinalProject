Estonian village between the mountains has become empty, almost everyone has returned to their homeland, only 2 men have stayed: Ivo and Margus. But Margus will leave as soon as he has harvested his crops of tangerines. In a bloody conflict in their miniature village wounded men are left behind, and Ivo is forced to take them in. But they are from opposite sides of the war. This is touching anti-war story about Estonians who find themselves in the middle of someone else's war. How do they handle it? How do the enemies act under third-party roof? —Annts 1990sabkhaziaanti warabkhaz georgian conflictyear 199267 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Drama War Certificate Not Rated Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Giorgi Nakashidze who plays the role of Chechen Ahmed is Georgian. Goofs As the movie begins, it is freezing weather and condensation from every breath from Ivo and the soldier inside Ivo's workshop is seen. They step outside and it is not as cold and their breath is not seen. Quotes Margus: Soon there will be rain. Ivo: There will not. Margus: They will be here soon. Ivo: Who? Margus: The Georgians and Russians. And the tangerines will stay in the trees. You know what this war is called? The war of citrus. Ivo: What do you mean? Margus: It's a war over my tangerines. Ivo: Be normal. They are fighting for the land. Margus: For the land where my tangerines grow.

I mean not in the literal sense but just on human level. I think, almost always, majority of the people who are fighting a war are not personally affected by its cause. It's something that's just inculcated in them. They are taught to hate the opposite side. This movie, with a handful of characters, in just so little words, in such a short time, makes you realize that you can empathize with anyone. You should just have the will to do so. Humanity is capable of so much love that there can be no place left for hatred, but sadly we're too busy fighting, every day, every where, in one or another part of the world. This is a captivating movie from the first frame to the last. The background score uplifts and complements the mood of the movie so beautifully. The acting is sublime, the direction is top notch. The story is really simple and all the charm is in the storytelling. It makes you question yourself. Whatever your hate is, if you can learn to empathize, then you've lived a life. helpful•10 0 shirifrnz Sep 4, 2017 Details Edit Release date October 17, 2013 (Georgia) Countries of origin Estonia Georgia Languages Estonian Russian Georgian Also known as Tangerines Filming locations Guria, Republic of Georgia Production companies Allfilm Georgian Film See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget €650,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $144,501 Opening weekend US & Canada $5,180 Apr 19, 2015 Gross worldwide $1,024,132 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 27 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 Related news ‘Holy Motors’ Star Denis Lavant Boards French-Georgian Gangster Thriller ‘Blood Burn’ (Exclusive) Aug 8Variety Film + TV Tallinn’s Baltic Event unveils first Cannes market co-pro projects Jun 10ScreenDaily Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Mandariinid (2013) officially released in Canada in French?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
