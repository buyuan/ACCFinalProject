Minutes after Laurie Strode (Curtis), her daughter Karen (Judy Greer) and granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) left masked monster Michael Myers caged and burning in Laurie's basement, Laurie is rushed to the hospital with life-threatening injuries, believing she finally killed her lifelong tormentor. But when Michael manages to free himself from Laurie's trap, his ritual bloodbath resumes. As Laurie fights her pain and prepares to defend herself against him, she inspires all of Haddonfield to rise up against their unstoppable monster. The Strode women join a group of other survivors of Michael's first rampage who decide to take matters into their own hands, forming a vigilante mob that sets out to hunt Michael down, once and for all. —harleyburnett halloweenmichael myers charactermurder spreekilling spreesequel146 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Evil dies tonight Genres Horror Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for strong bloody violence throughout, grisly images, language and some drug use Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Jamie Lee Curtis, Charles Cyphers, Kyle Richards, Nancy Stephens, and Nick Castle were all in the original Halloween (1978) and all returned for this sequel. The characters of Tommy Doyle and Lonnie Elam from the original also returned, but were recast with Anthony Michael Hall and Robert Longstreet, because Andrews is retired from acting since 2015 and Le Page never acted again after the original Halloween. Goofs On Ranbir Sartain's toe tag in the morgue, place of death is listed at Izmir, Turkey. This meant to be a homage to Haluk Bilginer, the Turkish actor who played Sartain in the Halloween (2018) but the toe tag should have been written as "place of birth" instead of "place of death" because Ranbir Sartain was killed in Haddonfield, Illinois. Quotes Laurie Strode: I'm coming for you, Michael. Connections Edited from Halloween (1978) Soundtracks She Doesn't Want You Anymore Written by John Carpenter Courtesy of Daniel Davies & Cody Carpenter User reviews1.6K Review Top review Made Me Root For Michael Myers Completely clueless about what it wants to be or where its priorities lie, Halloween Kills is an absolute trainwreck of a sequel from start to finish. A dull, pointless & thoroughly frustrating entry that fails to capitalise on the blank canvas after the 2018 film wiped the slate clean by retconning the franchise, this latest instalment is an utter mess that's all over the place and unsure of its own identity. Co-written & directed by David Gordon Green, the story shift the focus on other survivors of Michael Myers' 1978 killing spree by sidelining our protagonist yet does it so awfully that we are never for once invested in the new characters. Green does the bare minimum to improve the ride, has no idea what tone to settle with, and branches the story out in directions that's neither warranted nor called for. It attempts to give us a peek of the trauma that Myers inflicted on not just Laurie Strode but the entire Haddonfield community and skims on mob mentality in dumb, facepalm-inducing ways. The film is devoid of tension, build-up & atmosphere, Myers' looming presence is also gone, and the narrative flow & editing is a nightmare. The only aspects working in its favour are the grisly kills & Carpenter's score. Overall, Halloween Kills features a healthy dose of gnarly kills & slasher brutality but the rest is not only underwhelming, it's almost cringeworthy. The callbacks are mere distractions, the subplots lead nowhere, performances are forgettable, and it really made me root for Michael Myers as he creatively slaughters a lot of stupid, annoying folks in this. A wasted potential at best, this newest chapter adds nothing to the saga. helpful•241 74 CinemaClown Oct 16, 2021 All 'Halloween' Films Ranked by IMDb User Rating All 'Halloween' Films Ranked by IMDb User Rating See how IMDb users rated the twelve films in the Halloween franchise.See the list List FAQ5 Is Michael Myers actually 7'1" tall?
