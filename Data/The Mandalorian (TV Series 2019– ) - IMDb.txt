He ended up drafting members of the 501st Legion fanclub, who specialize in making their own Storm/Clone trooper cosplays.

Connections Featured in Geeks + Gamers: D23 - The Mandalorian Looks Amazing (2019) User reviews2.9K Review Top review 10/10 The Mandalorian - Now THIS is Star Wars This show is such a refreshing breeze of great quality Star Wars. Hopefully with Episode 9, this horrible era of Star Wars will end, and we will finally get what we all wanted the whole time - great stories set in the Star Wars universe. Stories like this, that make sense. Stories that hook us and make us want more, make us relate to the characters on the screen, just by showing their weaknesses along with their strengths. The Mandalorian has faced more adversity in these two episodes than Rey has in two three hour movies. Definitely my favorite character of the Disney Star Wars era, and he has only said a few lines. Brilliant directing, brilliant script, brilliant execution of everything. I can't wait to see where the story goes. John Favreau you have my gratitude and respect! helpful•960 248 vanja-pletikosic Nov 16, 2019 FAQ7 Why is the Mandalorian freezing people in carbonite when in Empire that was just a makeshift solution improvised by Vader? How can the bountyhunters track each one of their targets? When does this take place on the Star Wars timeline?
