Personal Quote: My father is from Palestine. He fought in the war in 1948 to make the State of Israel. He was a medic in the air force and army. My grandparents lived there. So I visited Israel all through my childhood. I spent half of fourth grade there. My great-great grandparents' names are on a monument in Tel Aviv as among the founders of Tel Aviv -- David and Rosa Mizrahi.
