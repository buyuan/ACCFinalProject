Hosted by world-renowned astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, this thirteen-part ground-breaking series will venture to new worlds, trace our roots back to the hearts of ancient stars, and travel across the universe for a vision of the cosmos on the grandest scale. —Agustín Garden cosmologyastronomyuniversesciencealbert einstein character7 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genre Documentary Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Speaking on Nerdist podcast #489, Neil deGrasse Tyson said that "(the show will be airing) on Sunday night (March 9, 2014), in prime time after it had been promoted during the Super Bowl, FOX had the Super Bowl, after it had been promoted during the World Series in the bottom of the seventh inning in game three on Saturday night, and it is airing on one hundred seventy-one stations around the world in forty-five languages. Any one of those sentences is a mind-blow, the fact it is all happening together is a stunning statement that there is a recognition by forces that be that science deserves to be mainstreamed." Crazy credits During the title sequence, the letters "C" and "S" of "COSMOS" appear briefly on their own in tribute to Carl Sagan. Connections Featured in Troldspejlet: Episode #51.10 (2014) User reviews187 Review Top review 10/10 Absolutely cannot wait until the next episode. This was so much fun--and it is so amazing that Carl Sagan's wife, Seth McFarlane, and Tyson Degrasse from NOVA are all together on this! I love the idea of using animation to portray ancient people--it completely avoids the campy feel of actors in strange beards and so-so backgrounds. Genius, Family Guy guy. I love the perspective it gives you, by really squishing enormous concepts into feasible bits of knowledge. It's not so you'll impress your friends--its so that you watch, and understand why you are so amazed by the universe. The computer animation of some of one of the first creatures to walk on land looks pretty darn tootin' real, as well--something that I loved. No strange feelings that their feet were hovering above the sand as they were animated--this is high quality. Additionally, Tyson seems more personable, even more likable, and definitely watchable because of his knowledge and enthusiasm for the subject. This is worth the watch, a wonderful surprise, and I am super excited for episode two. It's getting me to the gym to watch it on the treadmill. :) helpful•103 23 melinazahalka Mar 11, 2014 Details Edit Release date March 9, 2014 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Instagram Official site Language English Also known as Cosmos Filming locations Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA Production companies Cosmos Studios Fuzzy Door Productions National Geographic Channel See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 9 hours 17 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news New to Streaming: Bergman Island, Dune, Titane, and More Oct 22The Film Stage A Tribute to Carl Sagan: The Wonderful Mystic, Where Brains Meet Entertainment Jun 29Hollywood Insider - Substance & Meaningful Entertainment Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey (2014) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
