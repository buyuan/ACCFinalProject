He has so much to contend with when it comes to dealing with the folks of Craggy Island, Ireland. There's Father Dougal McGuire, who is as dimwitted as they come; and then there is Father Jack Hackett who lives for the simple pleasures of life (sleeping, drinking, and swearing). Ted tries to bring stability to his congregation as well as the surreal townspeople of Craggy Island. —Pat McCurry <ccgrad97@aol.com> character name as series titletwo word titlerabbitcarraffle43 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genre Comedy Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Dermot Morgan died only one day after filming the final episode. Quotes Father Jack Hackett: Drink! Feck! Arse! Girls! Crazy credits The sixth episode of the second season begins with the usual credits, but instead of Father Ted, the title reads: Father Ben. It then cuts to Dougal sitting in front of the TV, watching Father Ben. Ted comes in and makes fun of the character of Father Ben, saying he has no self-awareness at all. It then cuts to the normal credits.

Never has there been a comedy series like this and never will there be one like this again. I've never been an avid fan of Father Ted (don't know why) but as a person who doesn't watch that much television anymore this certainly gives me an excuse to turn the tv on and be entertained. Has done for years. Extremely unique and funny i would gladly sit down and watch a Father Ted marathon and watch every episode back to back. What is rare for a tv programme/movie is that i actually havn't met a single person who dislikes Father Ted! My favourite episode is the one where the whistle gets stolen. Fantastic. Shame there will be no more series but thank ourselves lucky they made three fantastic series. An all time great. helpful•82 5 fibreoptic Apr 22, 2004 FAQ2 What is Father Ted about?
