This a film for the young at heart - or the little ones, of course! Actually it's a children's film. But it's definitely more than that. It's warm, extremely well written - well, like the books it's based upon - superbly directed and offers excellent actors in excellent performances. Christine Urspruch masters the title role of the droll goblin-like creature with style. She "is" the Sams. Ulrich Noethen as her "pappa" gives a brilliant performance throughout the whole film but especially so in the dancing scene in the restaurant. I laughed tears and admired the choreography. Armin Rohde and Eva Mattes are terrific in the main supporting roles. Watching them eating sausages on an oversized table is just hilarious. But all this doesn't work to perfection without a perfect script. And this one is straight perfect. At last there we have the proof that good children's films can be made in Germany. It happens only once in a while, but at least it happens. This time it did! I hope Das Sams II will be as pleasant to watch as this one. With the same team they can't fail! And I love to laugh! helpful•4 0 missmarmite Jun 29, 2002 Details Edit Release date October 18, 2001 (Germany) Country of origin Germany Languages German Inuktitut Also known as The Slurb Filming locations Zurich, Switzerland Production company Starhaus Filmproduktion See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross worldwide $6,854,681 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 42 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Das Sams (2001) officially released in Canada in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
