To the world of the Mighty Boosh! Genres Comedy Fantasy Musical Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The series was called "The Mighty Boosh" because of a haircut Michael Fielding once had that his Spanish friend called "the mighty bush". Noel Fielding and their friends found it amusing and used it as the title. Goofs Apollo 11 only had two of the astronauts walking on the Moon's face, the third stayed in the Orbiter. Quotes Howard Moon: The wind is my only friend. Wind: [whistling] I hate you. Connections Featured in Boosh Publicity (2006) Soundtracks The Mighty Boosh Written by Julian Barratt Performed by Julian Barratt & Noel Fielding User reviews75 Review Top review The Mighty Boosh is a breath of fresh comical air! I can't praise Messrs Barret and Fielding enough for producing one of the finest comedies of the decade so far. It seems to have gone largely ignored by the masses, but I'm sure it won't be long before the rest of the nation catch-up and they'll all pretend they watched from the start! Like all excellent work you are constantly asking yourself "How did they come up with that?!" This for me is the beauty of this programme, it's completely original, imaginative and sometimes it seems completely spontaneous. It may take you one or two episodes before you are hooked but once you are you'll find yourself searching on your Sky remote through BBC2 and BBC3's listings trying to find out if it is on. If its on at 2 or 3 in the morning, so what, stay up, watch it, go into work tired the next morning it's well worth it. If your the kind of person who gets angry if you don't get enough sleep, then simply go into work wearing a poncho! It's impossible not to be happy in a poncho, but of course, you all know that! Boosh Forever!!!!!!! helpful•65 17 nickemu1980 Mar 29, 2005 Details Edit Release date May 20, 2003 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Official sites BBC Three (United Kingdom) The Mighty Boosh (United Kingdom) Language English Also known as Косијанери Production company Baby Cow Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 30 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 16 : 9 Related news Dana Gould & Bobcat Goldthwait Oct 26Trailers from Hell BBC Content Chief Charlotte Moore Talks BBC Three U-Turn, “Difficult Conversations” & Psb Power: “Svods Would Die To Have The Impact We Have” — Edinburgh Aug 25Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Spanish language plot outline for The Mighty Boosh (2003)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
