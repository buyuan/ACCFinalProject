You must evolve into the new Dark Knight and save Gotham from chaos. —DC gotham citybatcyclemicrosoft windowsplaystation 4playstation 545 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Action Adventure Crime Fantasy Sci-Fi Thriller Certificate T Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia Despite bearing some similarities to the Arkham series of games, namely the blowing up of the Wayne manor, Gotham Knights is set in its own universe, as evidenced by the different protocol names (Knightfall vs Black), Jim Gordon being dead, the general public making no reference to Bruce being Batman, and various other character differences. However, Rocksteady's game Suicide Squad (2023) will be set within the 'Arkhamverse'.
