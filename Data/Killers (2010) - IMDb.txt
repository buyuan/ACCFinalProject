But when he meets Jen Kornfeldt, a beautiful, fun-loving computer tech recovering from a bad break-up, he finds true love...and happily trades international intrigue for domestic bliss. Three years later, Spencer and Jen are still enjoying a picture-perfect marriage - that is, until the morning after Spencer's 30th birthday. That's when Spencer and Jen learn he's the target of a multi-million dollar hit. Even worse, the hired killers have been stalking the happy couple for years, and could be anyone: friends, neighbors, the grocery store clerk, even that crabby old guy shuffling across the street. Now Spencer and Jen are on the run for their lives. As their suburban paradise turns into a paranoid game of dodge-the-bullet, they must find out who wants Spencer dead and why, all the while trying to save their marriage, manage his in-laws, keep up neighborly appearances ... and just plain survive. —Lionsgate male objectificationsexual referencegrowing a mustacheman murders a womanwoman hits a man180 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines One Day Is Enough For You! Genres Action Comedy Romance Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for violent action, sexual material and language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Mrs. Kornfelt's wine glasses get bigger throughout the film. Goofs When Spencer points the Glock at the head of his friend after the fight and the friend is taped to the chair and after they get done talking about the dog you hear the sound of a hammer being cocked. There is no external hammer on a Glock pistol so it cannot be thumb-cocked. Quotes Mrs. Kornfeldt: Excuse me, Stewardess? Three chardonnays, please. Mr. Kornfeldt: None for me, actually. I like to stay awake and alert. Jen Kornfeldt: None for me, either. Mrs. Kornfeldt: Okay, so, just the three chardonnays then.

I would give this a 6.5 if I could. Surprisingly fun movie. Kutcher and Heigl worked pretty well together (it's a shame that she's caused so much trouble,, she really is good at what she can do, and by that, I mean she's one dimensional). Girl meets boy,, boy sweeps her off her feet,,, 3 yrs of wedded bliss,,,, are those bullets flying over our heads?!? YIPE!!! It's fun,, so just watch it! helpful•12 1 reddiemurf81 Mar 30, 2020 FAQ2 What's the first French song playing the club? Was Ashton Kutcher's French dubbed?
