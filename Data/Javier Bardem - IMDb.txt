Personal Quote: [on how has fame changed his life] Mostly, it's the same. I put on a hat and dark glasses and I can walk anywhere. But there are still questions which invade your privacy. I don't really know why people need to know personal details about other people's lives. It's out of control. For a lot of people, the press is now the enemy. See more » Trivia: Met Penélope Cruz for the first time on the set of Jamón Jamón (1992), but they would not become a couple until working together in Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008). They also worked together on Carne trémula (1997), but did not share any on-screen time.
