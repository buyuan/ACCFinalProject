Connections Featured in CTV National News: Episode dated 9 September 2021 (2021) User reviews4 Review Top review 4/10 Pacing, character building, coherent storyline? Who needs 'em? This not the worst movie I've seen. So anyone throwing a 1 or a 2 at it is likely taking themselves a little too seriously. Likewise, it is not great or maybe even good so anyone throwing a 6 or more is invested in the movie's success or else just tolerates mediocre much better than I do. This is not a lot of action. Not a lot of thriller. And the only real sci-fi does not make a lot of sense. You will likely have a hard time actually caring about the characters and an even harder time remaining interested in the outcome. And then when it happens you'll wish it hadn't because you will realize your investment in the payoff didn't earn much. Other than that though, excellent movie. Watch it yourself if you don't believe me. helpful•16 4 billyhoes Nov 13, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 8, 2021 (Canada) Countries of origin Canada New Zealand Official site Official site Languages English Cree Also known as 나이트 레이더스 Production companies Alcina Pictures Eagle Vision Miss Conception Films See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 41 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Danis Goulet on Storytelling, the Apocalypse & Her Feature Film Debut Night Raiders Nov 12QuietEarth.us Movie Review – Night Raiders (2021) Nov 8Flickeringmyth Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Spanish language plot outline for Night Raiders (2021)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
