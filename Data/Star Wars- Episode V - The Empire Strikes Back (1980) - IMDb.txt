Genres Action Adventure Fantasy Sci-Fi Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG for sci-fi action violence Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia In order to avoid sharing creative rights, George Lucas decided to avoid using a major studio to finance this movie. Instead, he bankrolled the $18 million production himself, using a combination of his profits from Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) and a bank loan. Although the move was risky, it paid off several times over. Lucas recovered his investment within three months of the movie's release. He then showed gratitude far beyond the Hollywood norm by sharing the profits with his employees (nearly $5 million in bonuses). Goofs Vader kills Captain Needa for losing the Millenium Falcon. When two Imperial soldiers pick up his body to carry away, the corpse steps itself up. Quotes Luke: All right, I'll give it a try. Yoda: No. Try not. Do... or do not. There is no try. Crazy credits In the alternate DVD version, the Emperor is still credited as being voiced by Clive Revill, despite his performance being replaced by Ian McDiarmid. Alternate versions The 1995 THX remastered Pan and Scan VHS release of the 1980 theatrical version has one difference from all other pan and scan releases and the 1992 and 1995 widescreen releases of the same. At the end of the film, the scene simply cuts away to the end credits. All other versions use a wipe to cut away to the end credits. Connections Edited into SP FX: Special Effects - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) User reviews1.3K Review Top review 10/10 I enjoy this one more than A New Hope So much amazing action and beautiful cinematography makes for such an enlightening experience! In The Empire Strikes Back you know who everyone is which is great plus Yoda is introduced! I love this movie the music is soothing, there's romance, more of Darth Vader, and introduces Emperor Palpatine what more can you ask for? A lot to relish and get excited about; it's such a classic gem. helpful•21 3 UniqueParticle Jan 16, 2020 FAQ34 Why did Darth Vader want the Millennium Falcon (eg. "I want that ship, not excuses")? Who shot C-3PO at Bespin and why? Why does the hyperdrive in the Millennium Falcon keep failing?
