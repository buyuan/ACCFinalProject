The unprecedented intimate streaming experience will take viewers on a journey as compelling and audacious as Madonna's fearless persona, Madame X, a secret agent traveling around the world, changing identities, fighting for freedom and bringing light to dark places. —Calmirio Plot summary Add synopsis Genres Documentary Music Parents guide User reviews47 Review Top review 10/10 Artists are here to disturb the peace! Madame X is a beautiful concept film, that gives you a sense of what the live show was like. Madonna crafted this persona to allow her artistic muscles to flex and she does not disappoint. The majority of the set list is comprised of tracks from the namesake album, but there are a few of her classic songs throughout the journey that keep the more casual fans happy. This is an audio visual experience not to be missed. helpful•36 27 modefan Oct 8, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 8, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Also known as Madonna: Madame X Production company MTV Entertainment Studios See more company credits at IMDbPro Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Madame X (2021) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
