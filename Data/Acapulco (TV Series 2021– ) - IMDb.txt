Yes it's not realistic, yes could be better but it's enjoyable, characters are likeable and the visual are fun, so yes let's not be overly critical about it and compare it to other series out there who are trying to push the boundaries. So far so good! helpful•16 2 firstblacksoul Oct 17, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 8, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Languages English Spanish Also known as 아카풀코 Filming locations Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, Mexico Production companies 3Pas Studios Lionsgate Television The Tannenbaum Company See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Color Color Related news Every IndieWire TV Review from 2021 So Far, Ranked by Best to Worst Grade Nov 8Indiewire ‘Acapulco’ Shows the Power of Multilingual Programming and Growing Subtitle Acceptance Among U.S. Viewers Oct 29Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Canadian French language plot outline for Acapulco (2021)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
