User reviews334 Review Top review 8/10 Gets better every episode I was on the fence for the first episode but it quickly won me over. The finale was alright. Interesting idea, not totally sure what that looks like for season 2, if it gets renewed. Whedon has been outed for pretty deplorable behaviour, who knows what that means. As is though, the Victorian super hero and Other narrative feels like it's well done. Clearly a lot of good casting and a pool of good writers to pull off something that's a bit tropey yet also niche and weird. I like having this in tandem with all the nihilistic "realistic" super hero shows lately. These questions are more interesting, imo. helpful•46 17 fraser-simons May 18, 2021 FAQ4 When will the show begin filming? Where is 'The Nevers' being filmed? Is this based on a book?
