Trump in this limited event series that tells the story of two powerful men, whose strikingly different personalities, ethics and loyalties put them on a collision course. Part one follows the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails and their impact on the election. Part two is an account of first months of the Trump presidency - where allies became enemies, enemies became friends and truth depended on what side you were on. —SHOWTIME tv mini series Plot summary Add synopsis Genre Drama Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia Jeff Daniels offered to play President Trump if no other actor would accept the part, though playing James Comey was his first choice. Brendan Gleeson reconsidered and accepted after originally turning the role down. Quotes Donald Trump: I need loyalty. I expect loyalty. Connections Featured in Jeremy Vine: Episode #3.217 (2020) User reviews217 Review Top review 8/10 Enjoyable but not perfect Enjoyable series though not perfect. It has a slightly hagiographic nature in relation to Comey though at the same time he comes across as pretty naive. Brendan Gleeson's portrayal of Trump is brilliant but you can't help feel it humanises him a bit too much. Some of the characters, especially the Trump side, are presented very one dimensionally as 'baddies', but perhaps that's accurate... helpful•27 30 Bangorboy Oct 3, 2020 Details Edit Release date September 27, 2020 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Showtime Language English Also known as Правило Комі Production companies CBS Studios Home Run Productions Secret Hideout See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 3 hours 30 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 Related news Jenny Lumet, Alex Kurtzman Launch New Production Company at CBS Studios Focused on Bipoc Stories Oct 26Variety Film + TV Pete Hammond’s Emmy Predictions 2021: Outstanding Limited Or Anthology Series – Who Has The Winning Chess Move In This Strong Field?
