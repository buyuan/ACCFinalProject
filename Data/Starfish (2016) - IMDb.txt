Their perfect life is totally ruined in a single moment after Tom had developed sepsis. While her husband was in coma, Nicola gave birth to their second child on the other side of the same hospital. Within a matter of days, sepsis would rob Tom of both his arms and legs, and left his face severely disfigured. As an ordinary man, Tom never put himself at risk -- he just woke up two months later in a nightmare, a face-off quadruple amputee. This incredible story of survival shows what can be overcome when love is unconditional. —MAthePA 1990scompassiontrue loverehabilitationhealth care10 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Never surrender Genres Biography Drama Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia When the film was shown for a potential South Korean audience an audience member was visibly shocked when Nic Ray (Joanne Froggatt) cursed and threw a phone. Director Bill Clark felt that this was proof that the localisation in the subtitles was effective, but was later told that the shock was that in South Korea you simply would not hang up the phone on one's mother in law.

This movie lost me a long, long time ago... I absolutely loved her apartment though. But I sincerely regret buying and watching this movie. It's a deeply personal story that completely escapes me. helpful•3 3 tailsofthewind Apr 15, 2020 Details Edit Release date October 28, 2016 (United Kingdom) Countries of origin United Kingdom United Arab Emirates Official site Twitter Language English Also known as Морська зірка Production companies CrossDay Productions Ltd.
