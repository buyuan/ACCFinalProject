Blanca forms a 'house', a self-selected family that provides support to LGBTQ youth who have been rejected by their birth families. Damon is a dancer who joins Blanca's house. Together, they compete in the balls -- where house members challenge each other in various categories and are judged on their outfits, attitude, or dance skills -- against Blanca's former house mother, Elektra. Pray Tell is Godfather to the children who compete in the balls. Angel is a streetwalker who develops feelings for a new client, Stan, who has a loving wife, Patty. James Van Der Beek co-stars as Stan's boss, Matt. —Jwelch5742 queer1980snew york cityball culturevoguing15 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genre Drama Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Pose features the largest cast of trans actresses of any scripted series in history.

Just want to give a shout out to MJ Rodriguez, who plays Blanca. She is the real standout in a very good cast. helpful•63 29 jgrv-1 Jul 5, 2018 Details Edit Release date June 3, 2018 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Official site Language English Also known as Поза Filming locations Louis Valentino, Jr. Park and Pier, Red Hook, Brooklyn, New York, USA Production companies Color Force Brad Falchuk Teley-Vision Ryan Murphy Television See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news Critics Choice Awards Voters’ Guide: 2022 TV Races Heat Up, Thanks in Great Part to ‘Squid Game’ Nov 17Variety Film + TV SAG Awards predictions for TV Drama Ensemble: ‘Succession’ far out front, but what about ‘Squid Game’?
