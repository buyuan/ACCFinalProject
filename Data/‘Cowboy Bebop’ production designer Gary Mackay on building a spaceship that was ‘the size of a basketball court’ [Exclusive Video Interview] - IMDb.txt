And it was a lovely reintroduction to get the opportunity to come and work on it,” he tells Gold Derby at our Meet the Experts: Costume Design panel (watch above). “I think because most of us were such huge fans of the original anyway that we felt like a real obligation to [be as faithful] as we could for the existing fans.” Set in 2171, “Cowboy Bebop” is a genre-bending series, mixing action, noir, Western and sci-fi, that follows a group of bounty hunters in space, led by John Cho. Mackay and his team had the “perfect kicking-off” point not just with the beloved anime, but they had access to approximately 600 sketches for the original.
