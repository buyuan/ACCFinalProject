Kappa House, the most sought-after sorority for pledges, is ruled with an iron fist (in a pink glove) by its Queen Bitch, Chanel Oberlin (Emma Roberts). But when anti-Kappa Dean Cathy Munsch (Jamie Lee Curtis) decrees that sorority pledging must be open to all students, and not just the school's silver-spooned elite, all hell is about to break loose, as a devil-clad killer begins wreaking havoc, claiming one victim, one episode at a time. Part black comedy, part slasher flick, SCREAM QUEENS is a modern take on the classic whodunit, in which every character has a motive for murder... Or could easily be the next blood-soaked casualty. —Fox sororitydevil costumemurderkillermascot30 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Pretty Evil (Season 1) Genres Comedy Horror Mystery Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Jamie Lee Curtis would have a thumbtack in her hand and would squeeze it to stop her from laughing and ruining the takes during funny scenes. Goofs Throughout out the series, it's clear that the actors/actresses portraying teenagers are actually in their 20s+. This is done as to not interfere with the schooling of real teenagers and to give the general viewing audience who are teenagers themselves people they can look up to. Quotes Zayday: [to Chanel] Bitch. I'm 'bout to smack you so hard your tampon's gonna pop out.

We want season 3, it's like life is always on the opposite side. When a silly series has 10 seasons and yet when we have an exciting TV show they just cut it and leave it uncompleted.
