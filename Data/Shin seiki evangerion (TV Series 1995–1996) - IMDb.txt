Young Shinji Ikari suddenly finds himself forced to pilot EVA-01, a giant organic mecha, designed and constructed by NERV, that is the only thing that can stop the Angels. —Chris Cleveland animelonelinesspost apocalypsemechafather son relationship164 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines The introduction into society, from child to adult Genres Animation Action Drama Fantasy Sci-Fi Thriller Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The series is heavy with religious symbols and motifs leading to a lot of speculation of the supposed symbolism. However Assistant Director Kazuya Tsurumaki claimed the religious symbols were chosen simply because they looked interesting while creator and director Hideaki Anno has never commented on this matter. Instead, when asked about the show, Anno has stated, "Evangelion is like a puzzle. Any person can see it and give his/her own answer. In other words, we're offering viewers to think by themselves, so that each person can imagine his/her own world. We will never offer the answers, even in the theatrical version. As for many Evangelion viewers, they may expect us to provide the 'all-about Eva' manuals, but there is no such thing. Don't expect to get answers by someone. Don't expect to be catered to all the time. We all have to find our own answers." Goofs In one episode, Rei and Shinji exchange EVAs during an experiment in synchronizing. However, when Shinji speaks to Rei over the video link, her display shows him as broadcasting from "EVA-01", his normal EVA, when he should be shown in "EVA-00", her normal EVA. Quotes Shinji Ikari: I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away. I mustn't run away. Crazy credits A different version of "Fly Me to the Moon" is played in each episode. Alternate versions The international version released on Netflix in 2019 omits "Fly Me to the Moon" by Claire Littley and replaces it with a piano track from the show's original soundtrack.

The Evangelion series is based on some of Sigmund Freuds non discussed theories and banned portions of the Bible that the mainstream do not know about but are well documented. The series points out what the original Bible does, shows the dualities we face in life whereas the homogenized version of the bible(new testament) would have you believe in a more monotheistic point of view. The mention of Lillith in this series which is Adams real first wife in the Bible not Eve as the newer versions of the bible would have you believe. Its hard to comprehend some portions of this Anime series without knowing a little about the unknown portions of the Bible such as the mentioning of Lillth and the Angels and Eva's. The Eva's are humankinds attempt at making the Angels which in the bible fell from heaven. The angels in this interpretation are trying to destroy mankind instead of eating them like in the original bible transcripts(Same idea). This series is a great interpretation of a lot of unknown aspects of the Bible and throwing in a little Freud and some elements of B.F. Skinners take on behaviours(such as the Absolute Terror Field which is created by children without a strong Female in their life,usually males Frued states abused children can create an AT barrier to keep others away)(Hypotheticaly but in this series it visually appears as a shield or as an attack weapon as in the knife). On the outside this is a great animated movie by studio Gainax/ studio I.G. but when your dwelve into the actual plot of is so beautifully orchestrated chaos. The game Xenogears was loosely based off this anime although more on the Psych aspect. This series has yet to be matched by any anime. I caught wind of this anime since I'm a big fan of MacrossPlus. I've been an anime fan since my pops went to Japan in the early 80s and always had awesome Mecha toys when he came back. This is a series you cannot passup. Rent them or buy them but take an entire day because you'll want to just watch the entire series all the way thru, its that good. helpful•111 54 bodycry Mar 25, 2005 Details Edit Release date October 4, 1995 (Japan) Country of origin Japan Language Japanese Also known as 新世纪福音战士 Production companies Gainax Nihon Ad Systems (NAS) TV Tokyo See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 24 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Related news The Meme-ification of ‘King of the Hill’ Nov 11Hollywood Insider - Substance & Meaningful Entertainment Anime Analysis: Neon Genesis Evangelion (1995) by Hideaki Anno Oct 6AsianMoviePulse Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Shin seiki evangerion (1995) officially released in Australia?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
