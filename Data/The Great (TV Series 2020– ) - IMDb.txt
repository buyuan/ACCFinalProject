Genres Biography Comedy Drama History Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia In the show they represent Peter III of Russia (Nicholas Hoult) as being Peter the Great's son. However, he was actually his grandson. Connections Featured in The 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards (2020) User reviews385 Review Top review Painfully unfunny. Not good drama or history either. So what's the point? This production is pretty to look at-beautiful sets, great cast--but the dialogue... I am four episodes in and groping for something to find amusing. It's clearly not intended to be taken seriously, but it's pretty thin as comedy. The screenwriters' idea of wit and humor is to have Peter III (Catherine's husband) and others say "F-k" (or variations on that) about twenty times in every scene. Yes, we get by episode 1 that he's a cruel dolt surrounded by sycophants, no need to demonstrate it over and over again without subtlety. The adultery and rape jokes grow tiresome. Including the word "Huzzah" a million times does not make the characters sound more authentic. Peter the III wasn't Peter the Great's son, notwithstanding a running theme about his inability to live up to his father, one of many wild inaccuracies, so when the writers admit that not much of the story is necessarily true, they understate the matter. Almost every single thing is made up, and not cleverly. There is palace intrigue as in all royal melodramas, and good production values, but overall the show is tasteless and vapid. If only the script were as smart as the costumes. helpful•82 79 altereggo123 May 18, 2020 FAQ2 Where is the info on the songs ending each episode?
