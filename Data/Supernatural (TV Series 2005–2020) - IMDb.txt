Meanwhile, Sam develops frightening abilities such as seeing visions of people dying before it actually happens. These visions are somehow connected to the demon that murdered his mother and its mysterious plans that seem to be all about Sam. When their father dies striking a deal with that very same demon, the brothers determine to finish his crusade. But disturbing revelations about Sam's part in the demon's apocalyptic plan are presented when John's dying last words to Dean are revealed. —Rachel B. brotherly lovemurderghostdemon huntervampire158 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Fear is a luxury Genres Drama Fantasy Horror Mystery Thriller Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Bobby Singer (Jim Beaver) was only supposed to make a one-time appearance. Goofs The show's rules say that the biggest flag for demonic possession is sulfur. We often see Sam and Dean sniff for it, or sniff a yellow powder suspected to be sulfur. Pure sulfur actually doesn't have the rotten-egg odor we associate with it - that's hydrogen sulfide, which is a gas. Pure sulfur is odorless. Quotes Dean Winchester: We know a little about a lot of things; just enough to make us dangerous. Crazy credits The logo/title card for the series changes with each season.

This show quality been going downhill ever since season 6, I kept watching for the characters, but they had the most disrespectful and horrible ending ever. It's like himym' ending but 100 times worse . Skip it for your own good. helpful•116 44 Morelia-864 Dec 19, 2020 FAQ24 what is deans ringtone ? Is there an end to this series?
