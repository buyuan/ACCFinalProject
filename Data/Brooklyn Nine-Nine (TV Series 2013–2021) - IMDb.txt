The other employees of the 99th precinct include Detective Amy Santiago, Jake's over achieving and competitive partner; Detective Rosa Diaz, a tough and kept to herself coworker; Detective Charles Boyle, Jake's best friend who also has crush on Rosa; Detective Sergeant Terry Jeffords, who was recently taken off the field after the birth of his twin girls; and Gina Linetti, the precinct's sarcastic administrator. policenew york citypolice detectivepolice captaingay cop71 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines The law.

Genres Comedy Crime Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Andy Samberg (Peralta) and Chelsea Peretti (Linetti) went to the same elementary school, just as their characters had in the series. Goofs CORRECT-GOOF: Holt carries a revolver rather than a semiautomatic like Jake, Rosa, Amy, Charles and Terry do because the NYPD allowed any officer who purchased a revolver prior to the department's switchover to semiautomatics in 1994--such as Holt, who had been with the department since the 1970s--to keep them. Quotes [repeated line] Jake Peralta: Title of your sex tape. Connections Featured in 71st Golden Globe Awards (2014) User reviews783 Review Top review 10/10 Delightful show, No Laugh Tracks, Golden Content Brooklyn Nine-Nine is definitely one of my favorite ever sitcom. It's a show of pure comedy with humorous stories that are naturally delivered by the lovely actors and actresses, but also with a consistent storyline which a lot of sitcoms lack. The other thing I've noticed which makes this show better is the exclusion of laugh tracks. Although, laugh tracks do, to a certain extent, seem to make shows more hilarious and to a point where even if you don't understand a joke, you'd laugh. But no, this show has no cheats like that and amuses viewers with original content. The show also does not rely on one-liners or simple jokes, and instead, make use of the characters' personalities and actions to entertain viewers, which is pretty smart. Some might think that entertainment with personalities do not last as they stay the same and eventually people would get tired of them. However, with the ongoing characters development, their personalities and stories are often changing, which makes the show so fresh all the time. helpful•310 25 ansonlam Jan 3, 2018 Details Edit Release date September 17, 2013 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Official Facebook Official Instagram Language English Also known as B9-9 Filming locations CBS Studio Center - 4024 Radford Avenue, Studio City, Los Angeles, California, USA Production companies Fremulon Dr. Goor Productions 3 Arts Entertainment See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 22 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news Encanto review – blandly frictionless fairy tale that misses the magic Nov 15The Guardian - Film News Cancelled or Renewed?
