When a brilliant bookstore manager crosses paths with an aspiring writer, his answer becomes clear: anything. Using the internet and social media as his tools to gather the most intimate of details and get close to her, a charming and awkward crush quickly becomes obsession as he quietly and strategically removes every obstacle - and person - in his way. —ahmetkozan bookstoreobsessive lovestalkernew yorkpsychological thriller25 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Not everyone wants to be followed. Genres Crime Drama Romance Thriller Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The reason the twins are called Forty and Love is due to their dad's love of tennis. Penn Badgley (Joe) has said that he got the name "Penn" because he was so small as an infant his parents named him after their preferred Penn tennis ball brand. Goofs As a lover of books, especially rare/antiques, Joe would know better than to fold back the covers of paperback books. It puts strain on the spine. Connections Featured in MsMojo: Top 10 Actors Who HATED Their TV Characters (2019) User reviews1.7K Review Top review 8/10 A surprisingly really good Thriller The synopsis and description does not do this show justice. I was captured by its darkness and intrigue from the start. So many reasons why this show worked well. In a bizarre and strange way the viewer can relate to Joe and his frustrations. We also see things from his point of view. Goes without saying his actions and behaviour is despicable but a crazy realisation is that Joe is in all of us. We all stalk other people's social media accounts behind the scenes. The only difference is Joe is prepared to go full throttle and act on his sociopathic tendencies. This is why he is such a fascinating character. Season 1 and Beck. Season 1 does a great job of showing how flawed, selfish and messed up the modern young girl can be. Benji despite being a flawed person himself understood what she really was and shared this truth with Joe. Joe was blinded by infatuation and his idea of the perfect soulmate. He was even willing to overlook her cheating because she 'loved' him. Nobody deserves to die but I didn't care much for Beck and did not miss her at all. Season 2 and Love. We saw a damaged and broken girl who was much better match for Joe (Will). A great season that sadly had its fair share of disaster because lets face it Joe attracts it like honey. Love totally surprised us. I don't see why they didn't end the show after season 2. It should be a mini-series. Season 1 and 2 flowed well and made sense but how to go on after this? Joe seems to have found a similar person that is as peculiar as him. Yes he can continue his usual habits with a new girl but it could have ended like that. He's not on the run anymore. Alas I will keenly watch season 3 when it comes out. helpful•38 11 Kingslaay Jan 11, 2020 Details Edit Release date September 9, 2018 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Official Netflix Official site Language English Also known as Kẻ Đeo Bám Filming locations 1575 York Ave, New York, USA Production companies A+E Studios A+E Studios Alloy Entertainment See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 45 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 2.00 : 1 Related news Eric Roberts, Saffron Burrows Wrap on Limited London-Set Series ‘Kensal Town’ (Exclusive) Nov 4Variety Film + TV You Boss Reveals the Emotional Storyline We Won't See in Season 3 Oct 16TVLine.com Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
