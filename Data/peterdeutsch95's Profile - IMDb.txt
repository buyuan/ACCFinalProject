Especially the Lifestyle of Hamburg is very good transferred in this movie and it feels very real. The storyline is told very slow, so Maybe the movie is not for everyone but all in all it's a good movie with great actors, especially Jonas Dassler who played the main character Fritz Honka.

Not a movie where you have to think to much but when you are bored on Christmas Day it's really entertaining to watch because there are many funny scenes and good actors.
