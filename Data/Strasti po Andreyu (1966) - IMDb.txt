But for the scene where the horse falls down the stairs, it was shot in the neck by director Andrei Tarkovsky. The crew acquired the horse from a slaughterhouse where it was going to be shot the next day. Goofs The smoothly-cut logs that feature many times in the early scenes are clearly cut with machinery not available in the early fifteenth century. Quotes Andrei Rublyov: You just spoke of Jesus. Perhaps he was born and crucified to reconcile God and man. Jesus came from God, so he is all-powerful. And if He died on the cross it was predetermined and His crucifixion and death were God's will. That would have aroused hatred not in those that crucified him but in those that loved him if they had been near him at that moment, because they loved him as a man only. But if He, of His own will, left them, He displayed injustice, or even cruelty. Maybe those who crucified him loved him because they helped in this divine plan. Alternate versions When released in the UK, the sight of a horse falling off a staircase was cut from this title. Connections Edited into Ombres vives ...une autre histoire du cinema... (2013) User reviews181 Review Top review The most profoundly affecting film of my life Having had the privilege of visiting Russia and anticipating a return next month, I admit to being a complete Russophile. The mystery, emotion and history of this remarkable country have found places in my soul I was scarcely aware of. This masterful film manages to evoke the sensations I felt during my month's long visit. The Russian people, among the dearest I have known, have suffered as have few others in all of history. The art of this magnificent country is always tinged in dark tones. The music, if not in a minor key, evokes minor key emotions. The literature, even with Gogol, clearly delineates the suffering and hardships with which all Russians are familiar. Therefore, it was not surprising to find all of this so strongly depicted in Andrei Rublyov. However, the beauty that somehow transcended the misery and bleakness constantly before the viewer was redemptive. The scene in which the iconographer holds the sobbing boy is one of the most touching and devastating on film. I sat before the screen with tears streaming down my cheeks. It may sound hyperbolic, but I found this film absolutely life-changing. I am returning to Russia to volunteer in an orphanage. Moreover, I am fully prepared to end my life in that great enigmatic country. Indeed, this film has changed my life. I cannot recommend it too highly. helpful•31 16 tb-24 Oct 9, 1999 Details Edit Release date December 1969 (France) Country of origin Soviet Union Languages Russian Italian Tatar Also known as 安德烈·卢布廖夫 Filming locations Assumption Cathedral of the Dormition, Vladimir, Russia Production companies Mosfilm Tvorcheskoe Obedinienie Pisateley i Kinorabotnikov See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget RUR 1,000,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $124,189 Opening weekend US & Canada $11,537 Sep 15, 2002 Gross worldwide $145,491 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 3 hours 25 minutes Color Black and White Color Sound mix Mono Aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 Related news Showbiz History: Andrei Rublev, Avatar 2, and a reunion for the stars of Grease Dec 16FilmExperience Andrei Konchalovsky’s Venice Competition Title ‘Dear Comrades’ Snapped Up by Films Boutique (Exclusive) Jul 31Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Strasti po Andreyu (1966) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
