Personal Quote: It was cool to be around that many Latinos, because when I'm on set it's usually white or whatever. It's no big deal, but to be around Mexicans and Latins, it's a little bit closer to family, more camaraderie. It's a different feeling, and it was cool to see that, and to realize that there actually is a part of Hollywood that is Latin [the set of American Family (2002)] See more » Trivia: Attended Schurr High School, Montebello, California, class of 1996.
