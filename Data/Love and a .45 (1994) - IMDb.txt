Their plan is to go to Mexico, but before they do that, they want to get married and visit Starlene's parents. —<uffe@enterpol.dk> pay phone1990sshot to deathblood splatterstabbed in the hand98 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines In The End There Are Only Two Things That Matter... Genres Crime Romance Thriller Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for strong violence and language, and for sexuality and drug use Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Wiley Wiggins, Rory Cochrane, and Renée Zellweger appeared in Dazed and Confused (1993). Goofs When Watty is driving with Starlene next to him, as they begin their trip to Mexico, in the shots from one angle, he is wearing his multicolor leather jacket, but from the other angle, he is not wearing the jacket. Quotes Watty Watts: [Narrating] When I was a young boy... my granddaddy, who had been a professional bounty hunter, he said to me, "Watty, only two things you need in life to get by on this planet: Love and a 45." Crazy credits "This film is dedicated to the memory of David Whitley and Marcus Brown." Alternate versions German version is cut for violence (ca. 1 minute) to secure a "Not under 18" rating. Connections Features The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946) Soundtracks Sleepwalkin' Performed by Tom Verlaine Courtesy of Rykodisc Written by Tom Verlaine Published by Verlaine Music (ASCAP) User reviews45 Review Top review 8/10 Unfairly Maligned...Clever, Violent, and Funny Some lazy and uninformed Critics and Reviewers can't help themselves and immediately lash out at this Movie's similarity to others Directed by Tarantino, Rodriguez, Stone, and Lynch. Truth of the Matter is that when Films are so near in release dates it is unfair and somewhat inaccurate to claim thievery. It is more likely and a bit Metaphysical that these Creative Folks were all tapping into that Akashic Record thing or what may be called the Hundred Monkey Theory. Whatever. This is a very good, Fun-Frolic Road Movie with White Trash Anti-Heroes and a Kick-Ass Soundtrack. More quirky characters than have a right to exist in any one Movie and some Witty Banter that makes it all quite a Rolicking Ride. It is over the top, around the bend, down the rabbit hole and off into outer space. Nutzoid and Naughty, Dirty and Delightful, with a Cast that cries out Cult Movie. It is proudly self-conscious, Violent, and Funny enough for it to become part of the Zeitgeist that was working in its Day and can not be ignored. This one will do nothing but gain Reputation and Admiration acquiring more Fans every Year. It was an easy thing to miss and dismiss this in the Mid-Nineties but if nothing else, the Success of Renee Zellweger will have the curious seeking this one out as a Career Starter and while she is a standout here, this Movie has more to offer and does so with layers of interest far beyond anything as shallow as Star Power. It gets its energy from a Chemical Compound and a Cultural Milieu that is forever Fascinating. helpful•15 1 LeonLouisRicci Sep 19, 2013 Details Edit Release date November 23, 1994 (United States) Country of origin United States Language English Also known as Amor y una 45 Filming locations Austin, Texas, USA Production company Trimark Pictures See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross US & Canada $35,200 Opening weekend US & Canada $9,086 Nov 27, 1994 Gross worldwide $35,200 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 41 minutes Sound mix Dolby SR Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news HBO Max New Releases: November 2021 Nov 1Den of Geek New on HBO Max in November 2021 Oct 25Gold Derby Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Love and a .45 (1994) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
