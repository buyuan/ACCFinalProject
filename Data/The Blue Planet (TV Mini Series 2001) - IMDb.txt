The BBC'S Blue Planet is simply jaw-dropping. I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say it contains some of the most beautiful sequences ever captured on film. From familiar creatures on and near the surface of the ocean to some more unrecognisable and just plain bizarre ones in the murky depths, next to nothing is left out. Weighing in at a hefty 8 hours, some people may want to check out the edited highlights brought to you in the form of the film "Deep Blue" but I would heartily recommend you give the series a go. I don't think it will disappoint and if your kids enjoyed the aquatic world brought to them by Pixar's Finding Nemo I'm sure they will love this too. I just wish all television was this entertaining. helpful•25 2 swisstoni Jun 15, 2005 Details Edit Release date September 12, 2001 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Official site BBC (United Kingdom) Language English Also known as Planeta azul Production companies ARD (Arbeitsgemeinschaft der öffentlich-rechtlichen Rundfunkanstalten der Bundesrepublik Deutschland) British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 6 hours 29 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Related news Mia Wasikowska, Radha Mitchell and Eric Bana to star in Robert Connolly’s ‘Blueback’ Feb 16IF.com.au TV News Roundup: Netflix Reveals ‘Deaf U’ Trailer Sep 23Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
