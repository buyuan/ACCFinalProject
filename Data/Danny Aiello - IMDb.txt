Personal Quote: I was 40 when I did my first movie. I didn't know what the hell I was doing. My interpretation of acting at the time, because I didn't know how to build a character, was pure energy. People call me an instinctive actor. I used to consider that an insult early on, only because I had never studied. Now... I love it.
