Now living in a nursing home, he's informed that the town's society leader, a former customer, has requested his services for her funeral. Escaping the nursing home with only his flashy jewelry, he heads to town on foot. Along the way, he visits the grave of his late partner, whom he still loves deeply, and is treated to a flashy wardrobe makeover by a woman who always admired his style. Dropping by the gay bar where he used to perform drag as "Mr. Pat," he learns it's their final night. He attends the festivities and recaptures some of the joy of his youth. He also faces the anger he feels at having been betrayed by his beauty shop protégé and the customer who abandoned him when his partner died of AIDS. —Jay Phelps <jaynashvil@aol.com> gayflamboyantgay bar90'saids victim124 more Plot summary Add synopsis Genre Drama Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for language Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Quotes Pat Pitsenbarger: Bury her with bad hair. User reviews28 Review Top review 10/10 Perfection. Kudos and blessings on Todd Stephens and Udo Kier for making an absolutely perfect movie. Acting, writing, casting, cinematography, editing, set design, costumes, soundtrack, music selections (two Shirleys.....Bassey AND Horn) and directing... it's all perfect. (The scene with Pat treating his fellow resident to a makeover brings to mind the scene in All That Jazz when Joe comforts a fellow hospital patient, and tops it.) Go. See. Laugh. Cry. Enjoy. helpful•15 3 jeffsocorso Aug 14, 2021 Details Edit Release date August 13, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Facebook Kickstarter Language English Also known as 驕傲粉天鵝 Filming locations Sandusky, Ohio, USA Production companies House of Gemini Luna Pictures See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross US & Canada $126,110 Opening weekend US & Canada $26,855 Aug 8, 2021 Gross worldwide $126,939 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 45 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Swan Song (2021) Movie Trailer: Terminally-ill Mahershala Ali clones himself with Glenn Close’s Help Nov 6Film-Book Concordia Studio Taps Lori Rovner, Former Imagine Entertainment, Skydance Exec, As COO, General Counsel Nov 5Deadline Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Swan Song (2021) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
