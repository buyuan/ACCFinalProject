At the outset, he flatly refuses saying he has no interest in training a girl. Frankie leads a lonely existence, alienated from his only daughter and having few friends. Maggie's rough around the edges, but shows a lot of grit in the ring and he eventually relents. Maggie not only proves to be the boxer he always dreamed of having under his wing, but a friend who fills the great void he's had in his life. Maggie's career skyrockets, but an accident in the ring leads her to ask Frankie for one last favor. —garykmcd boxingdeterminationwomen boxingboxing trainerdeath292 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Beyond his silence, there is a past. Beyond her dreams, there is a feeling. Beyond hope, there is a memory. Beyond their journey, there is a love. Genres Drama Sport Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for violence, some disturbing images, thematic material and language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia At age 74, Clint Eastwood became the oldest Best Director Oscar winner for this movie. Goofs The back of Maggie's robe has the phrase "Mo Cuishle". However the correct spelling in Irish Gaeilge is "Mo Chuisle". Quotes Frankie Dunn: It wasn't fault. I was wrong to say that. Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris: You damn right. I found you a fighter. You made her the best fighter she could be. Frankie Dunn: I killed her. Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris: Don't say that. Maggie walked through that door with nothing buts guts. No chance in the world of being what she needed to be. It was because of you that she was fighting the championship of the world. You did that. People die everyday, Frankie - mopping floors, washing dishes and you know what their last thought is? I never got my shot. Because of you Maggie got her shot. If she dies today you know what her last thought would be? I think I did all right. Crazy credits There are no opening credits after the title is shown. Connections Featured in The 62nd Annual Golden Globe Awards 2005 (2005) Soundtracks Blue Morgan Composed by Clint Eastwood User reviews1.2K Review Top review 9/10 A Punch In The Stomach I don't know why, but I went into the theater thinking I was about to see a female Rocky Balboa kind of deal. I left the theater in a daze. Overwhelmed by the simple truth of its conclusion. My hat to Clint Eastwood. What an extraordinary career. An artist of enormous proportions so well camouflaged behind a shy smile and a charming, clumsy attitude. I remember focusing on Clint Eastwood through a very different lens after sitting through "Pale Rider" a mythological, lyrical western. Actors love him because he, clearly, doesn't lie to them, doesn't kiss their asses. He quite simply gives them room to maneuver. Even someone like Meryl Streep, felt freer and capable to stretch herself all the way to Italy under his wing. Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, Tim Robbins, Jude Law, Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman yes mostly men but there was also, other than Meryl Streep, Genevieve Boujold. Marcia Gay Harden, Laura Linney and now Hillary Swank with a performance that not even "Boys don't Cry" could predict. The film is a triumph in every department. My stomach ached from feeling. That's a compliment Mr. Eastwood. Thank you very much. helpful•374 91 marcosaguado Mar 20, 2005 FAQ8 What is 'Million Dollar Baby' about? Is 'Million Dollar Baby' based on a book? What is C1 and C2?
