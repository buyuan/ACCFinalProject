Personal Quote: [on Tuesday Weld] She's a complicated lady and a gifted one; she finally does emerge in Play It As It Lays (1972). She's really so good in this, so super, and as far as her behavior is concerned, her comportment, she was just flawless--I mean, just a perfect child. She was there every day, on time, and worked like a tremendous professional. All that talk about her being a terror--not a trace. See more » Trivia: Half-uncle of pop singer Katy Perry.
