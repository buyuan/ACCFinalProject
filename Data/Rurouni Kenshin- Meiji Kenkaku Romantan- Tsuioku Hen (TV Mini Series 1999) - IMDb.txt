When the House he was hired by is defeated and forced into hiding, Kenshin must pretend to be the husband of Tomoe. The only catch is, Kenshin killed her fiance, and she is now secretly spying on him. While in hiding, Kenshin and Tomoe grow to love each other, and Kenshin comes to terms with who he is. This is the backstory to the Rurouni Kenshin manga and to a lesser extent, the television series based off of the manga. —Annonymous assassinflashbackpatriotsacrificegrief66 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Ruthless, Deadly, Still A Child. (Trust DVD Box) Genres Animation Action Adventure Drama History Certificate Not Rated Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Although the of Kenshin's life depicted in this OVA series was also detailed in the original manga, the TV series "Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji kenkaku roman tan" (1996) never mentions Tomoe by name, but Hiko does mention ask Kenshin about his lost love at Tomoe's gravesite in Kyoto. The only characters aside from Kenshin that also appear in the TV series are Saito, Hiko, and assumedly Shishio (the unnamed assassin). Quotes Kenshin: It's better that I do not know why they should die. Doing so would disrupt my concentration. Crazy credits The original DVDs from ADV Films replaced the original Japanese title card to read: 'Samurai X: Trust' and 'Samurai X: Betrayal'. This is restored for the Director's Cut DVD. Alternate versions The original DVDs from ADV Films feature the original 4 OVA episodes on two DVDs. These episodes were later combined into a Director's Cut DVD. Connections Featured in Anime Network Commercial 1 (2004) Soundtracks Quiet Life by Taku Iwasaki User reviews53 Review Top review 10/10 An investment I'm not easily impressed by a movie. Even worse with an animated one. But this one got me drooling. I picked this one up by recommendation, and I'll recommend it to anyone from now on. I was familiar with the story of the TV series, but that didn't excite me in the least. But at least I knew what I was looking at (and I suggest that people considering to watch this should familiarize themselves with the TV series first). Although the violence is very graphic and the dialog can be a bit of a drag if you lose track, everything else perfectly makes up for it. The animation is fluid, the art is beautiful, the pacing is impeccable and the soundtrack is gorgeous. Now combine all these elements in a single concluding scene, and you've got at least half of its viewers reduced to tears. This movie is very re-watchable. I've seen it at least 6 times already, and I'm eager to watch it again. Like most people advice; you should avoid the dub like the plague, but even the subs can be a bit misleading. I've had the pleasure to have seen 3 different subtitles on this movie, and the degree of accuracy of any of them is debatable. Although the plot doesn't suffer from this, the story and especially the details and references to factual Japanese history do. But this shouldn't stop you from watching this movie, instead, it should encourage you to set out and find out as much about this movie as you can. helpful•46 1 episode6 Sep 24, 2005 Details Edit Release date February 20, 1999 (Japan) Country of origin Japan Language Japanese Also known as Rurouni Kenshin: Trust & Betrayal Production company Studio DEEN See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 58 minutes Color Color Sound mix DTS Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 1.33 : 1 Related news Samurai X: Trust & Betrayal (1999) Mar 22AsianMoviePulse Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan: Tsuioku Hen (1999) officially released in India in English?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
