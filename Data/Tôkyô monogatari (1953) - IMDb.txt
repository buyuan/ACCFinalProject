Their other three surviving adult children, who they have not seen in quite some time, live either in Tokyo or Osaka. As such, Shukishi and Tomi make the unilateral decision to have an extended visit in Tokyo with their children, pediatrician Koichi Hirayama and beautician Shige Kaneko, and their respective families (which includes two grandchildren). In transit, they make an unexpected stop in Osaka and stay with their other son, Keiso Hirayama. All of their children treat the visit more as an obligation than a want, each trying to figure out what to do with their parents while they continue on with their own daily lives. At one point, they even decide to ship their parents off to an inexpensive resort at Atami Hot Springs rather than spend time with them. The only offspring who makes a concerted effort on this trip is Noriko Hirayama, their widowed daughter-in-law, whose husband, Shoji Hirayama, was killed eight years earlier in the war. Following the vacation, each child comes to some conclusion of their general behavior toward their parents, not only on this trip but throughout their entire adult lives. For some, this realization may come too late. —Huggo doctorwidowteacherselfishnesshairdresser224 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines As long as life goes on, relationships between parents and children will bring boundless joy and endless grief. Genre Drama Certificate Not Rated Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The film is notable for its use of the "tatami-mat" shot, in which the camera height is low and remains largely static throughout. Goofs (At around 1hr 45 mins) When the children are visiting their mother at home and leave the room to talk with the father in an adjoining room, just as they sit on the floor, the shadow of the boom-mic can be seen to drop into the scene and back out again, just over the son's head on the top right of the screen. This shadow is well into the frame against the edge of what appears to be a bookshelf and should not be considered a masking mistake of the projectionist. Quotes Kyoko: [after the rest of the family had left] I think they should have stayed a bit longer. Noriko: But they're busy. Kyoko: They're selfish. Demanding things and leaving like this. Noriko: They have their own affairs. Kyoko: But you have yours too. They're selfish. Noriko: But Kyoko... Kyoko: Wanting her clothes right after her death. I felt so sorry for poor mother. Even strangers would have been more considerate! Noriko: But look Kyoko. At your age I thought so too. But children do drift away from their parents. A woman has her own life, apart from her parents, when she becomes Shige's age. She meant no harm I'm sure. They have to look after their own lives. Kyoko: I wonder: I won't ever be like that. Then what's the point of family? Noriko: But children become like that, gradually. Kyoko: Then... you, too? Noriko: I may become like that in spite of myself. Kyoko: Isn't life disappointing? Noriko: Yes, it is. Connections Featured in Tokyo-Ga (1985) User reviews191 Review Top review 10/10 beautiful meditation on old age and family; simple and moving I can't take my mind off this movie. The story is both universally human (old age, the end of life, parents and children) and specifically Japanese. The movie tells the viewer so much about Japanese middle class life in the 1950s: eating and sleeping; mourning the war dead; clothes and home furnishings; spoiled kids; a doctor's office; a schoolroom; life in Tokyo and small towns; how family members talk to each other; old men's drinking habits; a resort hotel. But while we see all these details of a real time and place, we are constantly drawn into reflection on the meaning of human life and relationships. The reflection emerges effortlessly from the simple narrative and the specifics. The director never annoyingly tells us how to feel, he is not preaching and not drawing attention to himself. (There is none of that "hey, I'm making a moving movie" crud that you get in Hollywood treatment of these topics). He just lets the story unfold in a quiet, natural way. It's not for folks who only like "action" movies. I put "action" in quotes because this movie is about the real action in life--enjoying life, sharing it with others, facing the end of it. helpful•30 4 bobbie-16 Jun 17, 2002 Details Edit Release date November 3, 1953 (Japan) Country of origin Japan Languages Japanese English Also known as 东京物语 Filming locations Osaka, Japan Production company Shochiku See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross worldwide $40,468 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 2 hours 16 minutes Color Black and White Sound mix Mono Aspect ratio 1.37 : 1 Related news Festival Skills – Short Written and Non Written Forms.
