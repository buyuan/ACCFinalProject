Connections Edited into Amanda the Jedi Show: Faster than your First Time Reviews 2 - Best and Worst of TIFF 2021 (2021) User reviews3 Review Top review 3/10 One of the worst films I saw at a film festival I usually avoid American films at the Toronto Film Festival. This one sounded intriguing and I gave it a try because it was made after a supposedly successful play. Big mistake! First of all the sound is terrible and, sometimes, one hardly understands what the characters say. Then it is dark for the sake of being dark. All characters are sad, unfortunate, reveling in their sadness and pessimism. All their lives are train wrecks. There is no meaning that I could find in this film. I guess a good film for masochists without any other redeeming quality. helpful•11 43 plupu66 Sep 13, 2021 Details Edit Release date November 24, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Official site Language English Also known as 더 휴먼스 Production companies A24 IAC Films See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 48 minutes Color Color Aspect ratio 1.85 : 1 Related news Oscars 2022: Best Supporting Actor predictions and the state of the race Nov 15Gold Derby Frances McDormand Could Be the First Person Nominated for Best Picture and Acting Oscars Consecutively Nov 15Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the English language plot outline for The Humans (2021)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
