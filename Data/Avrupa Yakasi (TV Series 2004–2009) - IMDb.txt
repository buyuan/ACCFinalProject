The show is a sitcom about a group of friends that work in a fashion magazine, with the same name as the show, reside in an elite neighbourhood Nisantasi known for its butiques and high society life. Different Turkish family structures are portrayed which gives an idea about the different habits and traditions among the secular Turkish society. Some of the people that come from the Anatolian part try to fit in to the modern city life, some of them are born in this life and some of them try to conserve and adapt their traditions to the modern life. When these people come together, adventures do not stop. —deniz_ergun98 istanbul turkey Plot summary Add synopsis Genre Comedy Parents guide Add content advisory Did you know Edit Trivia Sacit and Volkan never appeared together throughout the series User reviews5 Review Top review Just love it! I make sure and watch this regularly. Enjoy it tremendously. I have just purchased all of season one off the net. The characters remind me of some people I actually know. I grew up in Sisli-Nisantasi area, know a lot of people from there some of them still live there. All the actors are remarkably good. I am very impressed by the writer, who is also one of the main characters in the show. Of course the appearance of Gazanfer Ozcan who is a longtime theater actor fills the show with his presence. Humeyra whom I have known as a singer is simply wonderful in her part. I have been living in Canada since 1968, have only been back for visits 4 times since, so needless to say this program is a visit home at a different time then I have left home, however some things never change. helpful•17 4 selmab Dec 1, 2005 Details Edit Release date February 11, 2004 (Turkey) Country of origin Turkey Official sites Instagram Offical Site Language Turkish Also known as The European Side Filming locations Istanbul, Turkey Production company Plato Film Production See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour Color Color Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the French language plot outline for Avrupa Yakasi (2004)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
