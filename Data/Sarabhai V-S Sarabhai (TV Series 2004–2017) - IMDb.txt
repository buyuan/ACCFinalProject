The family consists of Indravadan Sarabhai (Satish Shah) and his wife Maya (Ratna Pathak), who live in an apartment with their younger son Rosesh (Rajesh Kumar). Their older son Sahil (Sumeet Raghavan) and his wife Monisha Sarabhai (Rupali Ganguly) née Manisha Singh live in the apartment across the hallway. Maya considers the name Manisha middle class and renames her Monisha before their marriage. Monisha's middle-class habits irk Maya. Monisha, on the other hand, does not appreciate Maya's snooty and snobbish behaviour. Indravadan constantly derides Roshesh for being tied to his mother's apron strings and for writing bad poetry. Maya and Roshesh consider Indravadan's attitude towards Rosesh and his gregarious nature boorish. The ensuing conflict and comedy becomes Sarabhai vs Sarabhai. Much of the humour is derived from the fake, artificial and shallow interactions among the city's elite and their perceived notions of the shortcomings and failings of middle-class society. —Piyush Arora catchphrasecult favoriteshowoffstrange behaviormockery62 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Genre Comedy Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Maya Sarabhai, played by Ratna Pathak Shah is the sister of Supriya Pathak who play the famous role of Hansa Parekh on the popular TV soap Khichdi and Instant Khichdi. Both shows were written by Atish Kapadia and enjoyed great TRP. Connections Featured in Khichdi: The Parekhs Meet The Sarabhais (2005) User reviews55 Review Top review 10/10 Humour in every sense of the term One of the most humorous shows to have ever been aired on Indian Television. It generated moments of sheer magic in my life and everyone else's, i presume. The very funny attributes the characters of the show are infused with,along with the brilliantly written dialogues of the show all add to the immense popularity that the show garnered amongst the masses. Truly changed the face of Indian T.V. Sarabhai was a pathbreaker and a trendsetter in every respect. For every other shows that were aired after Sarabhai, it was difficult to follow fashion and match up to the standards set by Sarabhai vs Sarabhai. I wonder how many of them managed to surpass this. Extremely delighted that the DVD's have released. helpful•19 2 deepakkhasa Feb 8, 2014 Details Edit Release date November 8, 2004 (India) Country of origin India Official site hotstar Languages Hindi Gujarati English Also known as Сарабхай проти Сарабхай Production company Hats Off Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 30 minutes Color Color Related news Actor Rajesh Kumar opens up on his organic farming spell Dec 21GlamSham Hotstar Your Ticket To The Best Of Indian Entertainment Is now Available in North America Nov 13Bollyspice Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Spanish language plot outline for Sarabhai V/S Sarabhai (2004)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode Most anticipated Indian movies and shows Percentage shows amount of top page views. 1Marakkar: Lion of the Arabian Sea39.1% 2Ram Asur24.4% 3Bunty Aur Babli 28.3% 4RRR5.5% 5Antim: The Final Truth5.2% 6Matsya Kaand4.3% 7Pushpa: The Rise - Part 14.2% 8Satyameva Jayate 23.7% 9Dangerous2.8% 10Minnal Murali2.6% Updates approximately every 20 minutes.
