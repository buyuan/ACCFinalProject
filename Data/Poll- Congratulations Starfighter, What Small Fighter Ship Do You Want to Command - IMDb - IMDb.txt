(In my best Centauri’s voice* impersonation) “Greetings Starfighters! You have been recruited by the United Star League of the Star League, Starfleet, The Rebel Alliance, Battlestar Galactica, The Brown Coats, and all the other good guys to defend the frontier against combined the Evil Axis of Power of The Empire, The First Order, The Alliance, The emperor Ming, the Cylons, the Ko-Dan armada and every other evil space force. As Starfighters, you will be allowed your choice of one to four manned small fighter spaceships to pilot. So which one do you want?” “If you don’t see what you want, just describe it to me or my associates, Hans Solo, Chewbacca, and Captain Malcolm Reynolds over here and we’ll see if we can procure you one. If it belongs to the other side, shall we say, not admitting to anything illegal or unethical, of course, shall we say “Liberate”** you one?” “Just remember: 1, always trust Centauri. And 2, these ships are for fighting only. They don’t come with beds, toilet or a kitchen like a space yacht. I often wonder how Skywalker survived that long trip to Dagobah in that X-wing fighter with no bed, or toilet. Just food packs. Barbaric.” * As a salute to Robert Preston’s last film performance in The Last Starfighter (1984). ** AKA: steal from the enemy. See results without voting » Make Your Choice Vote! The Last Starfighter (1984) A Gun Star A 2 man fighter. The only fighting spaceship on film with a heads-up tactical display for a rotating command chair that tracts the guns with its movements. It has phasers, photon torpedoes, particle beams, and a massive payload called “Death Blossom”. For defense, shields and reflective armor plating. (Sorry, but the movie does spend a few minutes explaining what this thing has.) See more▼See less▲ Vote! Star Wars (1977) A X-Wing Fighter A 1 man and a R2 unit droid fighter. The droid rides on the outside and takes care of the ship’s functions which may be a weakness if the droid gets hit. The ship has deflector shields, photon torpedoes, and 4 to 6 ray weapons (probably phasers or lasers). (I watched the movie to get that.) See more▼See less▲ Vote!

Robinson Crusoe on Mars (1964) A Liberated Alien Spacecraft Extremely fast and has a bombardier ray port that is capable of shooting multiple beams at the same time which would make strafing extremely easy. If it is like the Martian machines in The War of the Worlds (1953) (which walked on invisible electro-magnetic beams), it can shoot phasers out of each of its wing tips. It has shields.

Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993) Maquis Fighter (Don’t confuse this with the Maquis Raider which had a crew of 33.) a 1 to 2 man fighter with warp capable speed and equipped with 2 type 8 phasers and Photon torpedoes and defensive shields (thank you Dan Dassow, it is hard to find small fighters in the Star Trek universe that focuses usually on larger starships.) See more▼See less▲ Vote! Titan A.E. (2000) A Liberated Dredge Fighter Sorry, This the best shot the IMDb had. (Scene 2 shot in the picture.) Completely made up of energy somehow solidified into a hardened material. Touch controls. Should be invisible to sensors because it has no metal parts, but in the movie, it wasn’t. (The movie has a few leaps in logic in it). Energy weapons and tractor beam. Bring your own air supply and space suit, because there is no evidence why the dredge would need to breath air to survive if they were made up entirely of energy.
