Caught up in the changing times is the uncle he idolizes, Dickie Moltisanti, who struggles to manage both his professional and personal responsibilities and whose influence over his nephew will help make the impressionable teenager into the all-powerful mob boss we'll later come to know: Tony Soprano. based on tv seriesitalian americannewark riotsprequelmen150 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines A Sopranos Story Genres Crime Drama Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated R for strong violence, pervasive language, sexual content and some nudity Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The film's title comes from Dickie Moltisanti's family's name which when translated from Italian to English means "many saints". Goofs When Tony is handing out free ice cream, the shot of him handing an ice cream cone to the boy wearing a vest (1:06:17) is re-used just a few seconds later. Quotes Richard 'Dickie' Moltisanti: [to Tony] Look, you want to be a civilian, I appreciate that. I'm all for it. But pay attention to me for once, okay? You take the speakers, right? At the same time, you promise yourself these speakers are it. Now, you say to yourself, "This is the last time I'm ever gonna steal something." And you stick to it. It's that simple. Connections Features Key Largo (1948) Soundtracks Stardust Written by Hoagy Carmichael and Mitchell Parish Performed by Artie Shaw and His Orchestra User reviews1.1K Review Top review 4/10 Not for The Sopranos fans. There are several reviews suggesting that only die hard fans of the series will enjoy this. Not true. My son and I had watched the entire series twice in the last 12 months. So we were well aware of the references made throughout the film. It just doesn't work as a movie. There are a lot of character introductions at the beginning that become tiresome. Somehow, the Italian Mafia are portrayed as weak and insignificant in the 60s and 70s. And while the Newark riots may well be an important part of Black America history, it felt tagged on and misplaced here. Overall, we left the cinema underwhelmed and disappointed. helpful•247 68 stefanbabicki Sep 28, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 1, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Official site Languages English Italian Latin Also known as 纽瓦克众圣徒：黑道家族外传 Filming locations Paterson, New Jersey, USA Production companies Chase Films HBO Films Home Box Office (HBO) See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Gross US & Canada $8,220,603 Opening weekend US & Canada $4,651,571 Oct 3, 2021 Gross worldwide $12,720,603 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 2 hours Sound mix Dolby Atmos Aspect ratio 2.39 : 1 Related news Critics Choice Awards Voters’ Guide: 2022 TV Races Heat Up, Thanks in Great Part to ‘Squid Game’ Nov 17Variety Film + TV What to Watch on Vudu: ‘The Many Saints of Newark,’ Abel Ferrara’s ‘Zeros and Ones,’ the Original ‘Ghostbusters’ and More Nov 16Fandango Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Japanese language plot outline for The Many Saints of Newark (2021)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
