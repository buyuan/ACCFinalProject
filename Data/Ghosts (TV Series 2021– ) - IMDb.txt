Goofs According to the exterior shots of the mansion, there should be hallways running left and right from the entryway to more rooms. The interior set instead features rooms and a staircase along a front hall in line with the entry way. Connections Remake of Ghosts (2019) User reviews178 Review Top review 8/10 Charming I have not seen the British version, but I found this show very funny and original. Lots of fun quirky characters and I laughed out loud, which I rarely do. Great addition to the Thursday lineup. helpful•32 15 cockezville Oct 16, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 7, 2021 (United States) Countries of origin United Kingdom United States Official site Official site Language English Also known as Duchovia Production companies Joe vs. Joe Monumental Television Them There See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news The Flash's Grant Gustin Breaks Down 'Armageddon' Warning, How Barry Will Come to Think 'Maybe This Is Possible' Nov 17TVLine.com 2021-22 TV Show Season Ratings (week eight) Nov 16TVSeriesFinale.com Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Mexican Spanish language plot outline for Ghosts (2021)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
