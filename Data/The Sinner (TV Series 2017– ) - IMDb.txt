The event launches an inverted and utterly surprising crime thriller whose driving force is not the "who" or the "what" -- but the "why" -- as an investigator finds himself obsessed with uncovering the woman's buried motive. Together they travel a harrowing journey into the depths of her psyche and the violent secrets hidden in her past. —ahmetkozan trauma triggerblocked memoryamnesiapast coming back to hauntolder sister younger sister relationship48 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Everyone knows she did it.

(Season 1) Genres Crime Drama Mystery Thriller Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Originally developed as a one-season 'limited TV series', however, USA Network was so pleased with the ratings, they wanted the writers/producers to develop a season 2. Although still considered a 'limited series', it has morphed into an 'anthology series'. Bill Pullman's detective character from season 1 returns, along with a new mystery to solve, and primarily new cast. Jessica Biel is an executive producer.

Usually only if something is extraordinary or horrible. This show had me on the edge of my seat the whole season from start to finish! Jessica biel has always been a good actress, but her performance in this blew me away! Hope she does more dramas like this in the future.. she's a natural. helpful•153 27 emoweeee Jul 15, 2018 Details Edit Release date August 2, 2017 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Official Facebook Official site Language English Also known as Грішники Filming locations Congers, New York, USA Production companies Iron Ocean Films Universal Cable Productions See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 45 minutes Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news The Sinner's David Huynh Talks Cj's Embarrassing, Private but Vital Scene and a Whole Lot More!
