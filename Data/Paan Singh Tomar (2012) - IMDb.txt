Goofs Pan Singh Tomar told his interviewer that International Defence Athletic Meet was the most important race of his life, however no record was involved. In the flashback his elder brother was telling the fellow villagers that in recently concluded International Defence Athletics Meet Subedar Paan Singh Tomar has broken his own record. Quotes Journalist: You tricked the police of three states. This was quite a big scandal. Paan Singh Tomar: That's the misfortune of our country. I crossed 28 barriers & 7 water pits to become the national champion, nobody cared. But when I fooled the police and do a kidnapping then everybody started chanting, Paan Singh... Paan Singh! Journalist: I agree. Sports persons in this country are in a very poor condition. Paan Singh Tomar: Don't shed crocodile tears. Had I been only a mere sportsperson, would you've taken so much risk to come & interview me? Journalist: I agree. Connections Featured in 58th Filmfare Awards (2013) User reviews100 Review Top review 9/10 Along comes Irrfan!! A die-hard patriot and an international level athlete who is forced to become a dacoit or should I say 'Baaghi'. Commendable performances by almost the entire cast right from Irrfan Khan to the nervous journalist (Bijendra Kala). Mahie Gill matches steps with Irrfan in a fiery and yet restrained performance. I hand my hat to Tigmanshu Dhulia for crisp dialogues, subtle humor and bringing out the Chambal live to you. You can actually feel the grime and dust of the infamous land. Needless to say Irrfan Khan has delivered superlative performance. He has defined what is called as an 'Effortless Performance'. I hope that this movie brings him the most deserved laurels as he brought the same to the movie. 'Irrfan Khan is Pan Singh Tomar'.
