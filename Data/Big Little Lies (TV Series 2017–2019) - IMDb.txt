Big Little Lies is a brilliant take on ex-husbands and second wives, schoolyard scandal, and the dangerous little lies we tell ourselves just to survive. —Anand Patel domestic violencemother daughter relationshipabusemurderhusband wife relationship18 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines it's a wonderful lie.

Connections Featured in The Late Show with Stephen Colbert: Shailene Woodley/Laverne Cox/Rick & Marty Lagina (2017) Soundtracks Cold Little Heart Performed by Michael Kiwanuka User reviews534 Review Top review 10/10 Wow, just wow! I have HBO and NEVER watch it. I'm not a big fan of what apparently many other people like to watch. But when I saw the commercial for this I was intrigued. I never heard of the book, but highly respect many of the lead actors so I figured if they were involved it couldn't totally suck. Speaking of suck, I was completely sucked in on the first episode. I don't know why but I found this show completely and utterly mesmerizing, all the way down to the music and cinematography. Everyone involved in this from top to bottom hit it out of the park. I've never experienced this kind of life-style (ie mommy, daddy and school politics) but one of my clients who watches the show and lives in the general area said they nailed her experience when her kids were in school. To put in perspective, I usually work when I watch TV, don't really even 'watch' it, just background noise. Not only did I stop working to watch this, I ran the last few minutes in slow motion to fully absorb what happened. I can't give a show much more praise than that! You'll understand the scene I'm talking about when you see it. helpful•138 42 mrocco-1 Apr 2, 2017 FAQ1 If the kids are in the ages between 6 and 7 years old isn't that a little weird that they choose Nicole Kidman and Laura dern to play the role of a 6 years old mother? I mean till what age you can still get pregnant?
