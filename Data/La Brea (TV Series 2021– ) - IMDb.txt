Genres Drama Mystery Sci-Fi Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Gavin Harris has a beard in a 2018 flashback where he describes his plane crash. As he was in the military it's unlikely he had a beard, for safety reasons if nothing else. Connections Featured in NBC Sunday Night Football: NFL Kickoff Game: Dallas Cowboys vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (2021) User reviews460 Review Top review 3/10 Sci Fi Channel programming Not a bad premise but atrocious writing and Sharknado levels of CGI. I tried making a drinking game from this show, every time someone said something ridiculous I took a drink, I was just discharged from the hospital with alcohol poisoning. helpful•168 20 Craig-fikes Sep 30, 2021 Details Edit Release date September 28, 2021 (United States) Country of origin United States Official site Official site Language English Also known as Vùng Đất Nguyên Thuỷ Filming locations Mount Macedon, Victoria, Australia Production companies Matchbox Pictures Keshet Studios Bad Apple See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Color Color Sound mix Stereo Aspect ratio 16:9 HD Related news Watch La Brea Online: Season 1 Episode 8 Nov 17TVfanatic ‘La Brea’ Reveals Gavin’s Connection to 10,000 BC & Explains His Visions (Recap) Nov 17TV Insider Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the Japanese language plot outline for La Brea (2021)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
