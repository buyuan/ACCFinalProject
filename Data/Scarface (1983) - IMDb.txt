The world will remember him by another name...SCARFACE. Genres Crime Drama Certificate R Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia During the scene where Tony and Elvira are sitting in the Cadillac at the car dealership, Al Pacino surreptitiously slips on the hat that Michelle Pfeiffer was wearing while she was looking away, which was not scripted. When she turns back and sees him wearing it, her amused reaction was genuine and to her credit, she stayed in character and ad-libbed a line. Brian De Palma decided to keep that unscripted exchange in the movie to show Elvira's gradual warming up to Montana. Goofs Director Brian De Palma is visible in the mirror in the last close-up of Tony in the Babylon Club before the shootout begins. Quotes Tony Montana: You wanna fuck with me? Okay. You wanna play rough? Okay. Say hello to my little friend! [Tony shoots] Crazy credits In the opening we see a crawl text (with narrator) that reads: "In May of 1980, Fidel Castro in an effort to normalize relations with the Carter Administration opened the harbor at Mariel, Cuba with the apparent intention of letting some of his people join their relatives in the United States. Within seventy-two hours, 3,000 U.S. boats were headed for Cuba. In the next few weeks, it became evident that Castro was forcing the boat owners to carry back with them not only their relatives but the dregs of his jail population. By the time the port was closed 125,000 'Marielitos' had landed in Florida. An estimated 25,000 had criminal records. This is the story of that minority those they call 'Los Bandidos'." Alternate versions To get a 16 rating in West Germany, most of the violence and profanity were toned down.
