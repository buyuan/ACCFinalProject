Homer is the oafish unhealthy beer loving father, Marge is the hardworking homemaker wife, Bart is the perpetual ten-year-old underachiever (and proud of it), Lisa is the unappreciated eight-year-old genius, and Maggie is the cute, pacifier loving silent infant. —Sam Kelly cult tvbeeradult animationsatiredysfunctional family187 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines On Your Marks, Get Set, D'Oh! Genres Animation Comedy Certificate TV-PG Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia After Phil Hartman was murdered, the various characters he played, such as lawyer Lionel Hutz and actor Troy McClure, were retired, rather than re-cast. However, they continued to appear silently in crowd scenes. Season ten, episode three, "Bart the Mother" (September 27, 1998) was his final voice performance. Goofs Ralph Wiggum is in Bart's class in some episodes and Lisa's in others. The same can be said about a few other recurring students. Quotes Lisa: Dad, just for once don't you want to try something new? Homer: Oh Lisa, trying is just the first step toward failure. Crazy credits There is one episode where Homer complains about how rich all the people listed in the closing credits (save for one) are. When the Gracie film logo comes up, Homer says, "Don't 'SSSHHH' me, you rich bastard!" Alternate versions Beginning with the show's cable syndication run on FXX on August 21, 2014, new syndication masters have been created. Each episode has been restored to its full length, and is now presented in 16X9 high definition. In addition, credits for the Spanish SAP Translation have been added to the end credits of each episode. Connections Edited into Springfield's Most Wanted (1995) Soundtracks The Simpsons Theme Written by Danny Elfman User reviews885 Review Top review the absolute Best Cartoon ever! Out of every cartoon, Movie, play, and T.v show I've ever seen The Simpsons tops it all. the Simpsons is the funniest show Bar None. American Dad, Futurama, and Family guy come in close but in my opinion the Simpsons is better than all of them combined. I have seen every single episode and i own seasons one through five and have Simpsons posters and action figures.i have not found an episode that i did not like., some of my favorites are the valentines episode where Bart puts Homers Beer in the paint shakers, and "Das Bus" season 9 "O' Brother were art Thou?" season 2. and any episode from the sixteenth season. they have made it to over three hundred episodes and I'm betting on three hundred more.
