Tom Selleck was okay with the idea, but CBS and the syndicators were opposed. CBS renewed the show for an 8th season the night before production began on this episode. He was still writing the episode at the time, and left Magnum walking off into the clouds because the producers knew they would be bringing him back in the first episode of the 8th season. Goofs during the chase scene in this episode the Audi appears to have a manual gear shifter, but in episode 3 of season 7 "straight and narrow" it is claimed to have an automatic. Magnum suffering from a leg injury claims to take the Audi just because it has an automatic. Connections Edited from Magnum, P.I.: Paradise Blues (1984) Soundtracks Looking For Space (uncredited) Written by John Denver Performed by John Denver User reviews4 Review Top review 10/10 The deepest, most emotional, Magnum episode Magnum is shot and left for dead at a warehouse. Now he walks like a ghost through his world. Magnum episodes tend to be fairly one-dimensional in plot: someone comes to Magnum with a problem, Magnum investigates, after some great action sequences, Magnum catches bad guys. It is the sub-plots and banter (and scenery) that gave the series its charm and engagement. This episode takes a deviation from this formula, and it's a wonderful one. With Magnum having to deal with the possibility of his own death, relationships and looking out for the people he cares about become the primary focus. It's easily the deepest Magnum episode and a very moving experience. helpful•16 4 grantss Aug 26, 2019 Details Edit Release date April 15, 1987 (United States) Country of origin United States Languages Greek English Filming locations Anderson Estate, 41-505 Kalanianaole Highway, Waimanalo, O'ahu, Hawaii, USA Production companies Belisarius Productions Glen A.
