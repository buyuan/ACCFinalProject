When I first started watching this around 2-3 episodes in it reminded me of the first time I accidentally stumbled across Cobra Kai on YouTube Red and wondered why a quality show like this was on a very relatively low par streaming service. The people involved with this have pretty much covered Diego Maradona's entire life from 8 years old and it was absolutely fascinating. There are so many interesting facts about the series and if you're like me you'll be looking at Wikipedia and constantly pausing/resuming whilst watching (the Amazon x-ray thing is very handy) to read about the characters involved in his life and it was very colourful indeed. I love the fact it mixes in real footage during certain scenes and is a brave but brilliant way to keep you interested. The end credits of each episode in particular are good with old photos and videos showing in real life what happened in that particular episode. All in all if you're really a fan of Diego and I obviously don't know how much of it is true but it's really fascinating and taught me not just about Maradona but the politics and death the Argentines had to deal with in the 60/70s which was an eye opener. I've seen the documentary from a couple of years ago and for me, the detail involved for me is far greater with the show and is well worth a watch. BTW I'm a 43 year old fan from England and I still don't forgive him for Mexico 86 but I definitely have a new found respect for him after watching this show. helpful•1 0 wisey-28218 Nov 15, 2021 Details Edit Release date October 29, 2021 (Argentina) Countries of origin United States Argentina Languages Spanish Italian English Also known as Maradona: Blessed Dream Filming locations Buenos Aires, Federal District, Argentina Production companies Amazon Studios BTF Media BTF Media See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Related news MipCancun 2021: A Content Feeding Frenzy, Buzz Titles, Mexico & Big Production Plays Nov 17Variety Film + TV Latin American TV Trends – Broken Down by The Wit at MipCancun Nov 17Variety Film + TV Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap By what name was Maradona, sueño bendito (2021) officially released in Japan in Japanese?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore List The Best Movies and Shows to Watch in November See the full list 1:45 3 Hidden Gems for "Squid Game" Fans Watch the video Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
