A ranger, Grace, takes him in and asks him how he survived all by himself. He says he had a friend named Elliott and draws a picture of a dragon, saying it's Elliott. Grace takes the picture to her father who claims that years ago he encountered a dragon in the forest. Grace takes Pete back to the forest and he shows her his home and Elliott. A man sees Elliott, and when he tells about his experience and isn't believed, he sets out to capture the dragon to prove it. —anonymous orphandragonboyboy girl friendshipinvisibility61 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Some secrets are too big to keep. Genres Action Adventure Comedy Drama Family Fantasy Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG for action, peril and brief language Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Robert Redford rescued an abandoned horse on the second day of shooting. Goofs There is a scene when they enter the main street and it is set up like an American street, i.e.: drivers on the right side and marking on the right.. BUT of on a side street, they have failed to correct the New Zealand road markings and cars are on the left. Quotes Grace: I know those woods. I know those woods like the back of my hand. I couldn't have missed a dragon. Meacham: Well, you missed Pete.

You can imagine my excitement and also my apprehension when I learned that this film was being filmed. This is a very enjoyable family film that has lovely moments of tenderness, wonderful special effects (the design of Elliot, flying scenes, etc.), it has fun and plenty of action, and Redford and Howard are good in their roles and seem to believe in magic because I thought they were the best thing in the film. However, the movie lack the most important thing to me -- magic. All the characters keep speaking about magic, but the actors playing them don't believe in magic, the film does not create magic, so it feels a lovely fantasy film not a magic children's film. I didn't feel it in my heart. And that being the case, the film is not memorable to me. helpful•12 5 Imdbidia Apr 29, 2017 Details Edit Release date August 12, 2016 (United States) Countries of origin United States New Zealand Official site Official Site Language English Also known as Pete và Người Bạn Rồng Filming locations Tapanui, Otago, New Zealand Production companies Walt Disney Pictures Whitaker Entertainment I See more company credits at IMDbPro Box office Edit Budget $65,000,000 (estimated) Gross US & Canada $76,233,151 Opening weekend US & Canada $21,514,095 Aug 14, 2016 Gross worldwide $143,695,338 See detailed box office info on IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour 42 minutes Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Dolby Atmos Aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 Related news Augustine Frizzell to Direct ‘The Invisible Life of Addie Larue’ Film Adaptation for eOne (Exclusive) Nov 16Variety Film + TV Oscars 2022: Best Visual Effects Predictions Oct 22Indiewire Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
