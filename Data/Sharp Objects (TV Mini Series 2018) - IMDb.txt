For years, Camille has hardly spoken to her neurotic, hypochondriac mother or to the half-sister she barely knows: a beautiful 13 year old with an eerie grip on the town. Now, installed in her old bedroom in her family's Victorian mansion, Camille finds herself identifying with the young victms - a bit too strongly. Dogged by her own demons, she must unravel the psychological puzzle of her own past if she wants to get the story - and survive this homecoming. —Jessica Silva based on novelhometownmurderjournalistself harm28 more Plot summary Add synopsis Taglines Welcome home Genres Crime Drama Mystery Thriller Certificate TV-MA Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Australian actress Eliza Scanlen makes her American debut as Amma, the half-sister of Camille (Amy Adams). Eliza who'd provided an audition tape from her hometown Sydney, was later flown to the U.S. to screen test with Amy for director Jean-Marc Vallée. Of Amy's kindness to her on set Eliza has said that, "She really took me under her wing," this being her first major role in a foreign country. Goofs Despite the fact that young girls have been found murdered in and around the community, young girls are seen brazenly roller-skating after dark--even recklessly along highways--with no apparent curfew in force or parents keeping their kids safely at home.

A hats off to Jean Marce Vallee. This is a masterpiece. I still didn't get over from the finale. Especially from the post credits scenes. This is far better than the brilliant Big Little Lies by the same director, which was really good too. We can't really decide who did their roles best. Amy Adams or Patricia Clarkson or Eliza Scanlen. They were absolutely stunning. A must watch for all. helpful•80 35 Azanspy Aug 31, 2018 Details Edit Release date July 8, 2018 (United States) Country of origin United States Official sites Official Facebook Official Site Language English Also known as Гострі предмети Filming locations Barnesville, Georgia, USA Production companies Crazyrose Fourth Born Blumhouse Television See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 7 hours 1 minute Color Color Sound mix Dolby Digital Aspect ratio 1.78 : 1 Related news HBO TV Show Ratings (updated 11/16/2021) Nov 16TVSeriesFinale.com Sydney Sweeney in "Fashion" Nov 16SneakPeek Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content IMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our data Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
