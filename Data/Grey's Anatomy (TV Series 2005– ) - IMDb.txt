Genres Drama Romance Certificate TV-14 Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia Miranda Bailey was the only role written with a character description: "tiny blonde with curls". Goofs Many of the female surgeons will wear jewelry while scrubbing in, as well as while operating. This is prohibited in real Operating Rooms. Also, many of the surgeons (especially Dr. Maggie Pierce -Kelly McCreary) have long nails which is a no-no for a surgeon. Quotes Dr. Derek Shepherd: It's a beautiful day to save lives. Let's have some fun. Connections Featured in Class Dismissed: How TV Frames the Working Class (2005) User reviews671 Review Top review With "Anatomy," ABC Scores A Triple! The Network From Nowhere really knocked me for a loop by smacking the viewing audience upside its collective head with THREE strong series that came out winners: "Desperate Housewives" and "LOST" being the first two. Now that we are well into the second season for both of those, and their story arcs are looking a little 'iffy', it's the third and most surprising contender, "Grey's Anatomy", that looks to be the strongest of the bunch. As the follow-up riding on "Housewives'" coattails, I was ready to dismiss it outright as "Ally McBeal in hospital scrubs." But not having much else to watch in that time slot, I decided to give it a try, and was I pleasantly shocked! Though there ARE some moments where the principal characters come off as self-centered, neurotic and at times downright eccentric, it never reached the level of absurdity that "Ally" often did, and thank God for that! Ellen Pompeo as Dr. Meredith Grey comes off as likable and probably more self-aware and introspective than self-absorbed and scatterbrained, though there are moments you do want to reach into the screen and give her a good shaking. And good call on the ensemble casting! You really have to give props to any show that FINALLY figures out how to effectively showcase the sweet-and-sour charms of Sandra Oh, who was good enough to elevate a sow's ear of a show like "Arli$$," if not to save it. And not to mention give assorted actors who have all been great in projects not up to their talents, the chance to really shine in some very well-written roles, and I want to single out Katherine Heigl, Justin Chambers, Chandra Wilson and especially T.R. Knight as George, who is really coming into his own as this season progresses. Not to snub Isaiah Washington, James Pickens, Jr., Kate Walsh or the so-hot-it's-criminal Patrick Dempsey. Seasoned vets all, it's just good to see them all land in a nice place where they can do great work with some sense of job security. (WE HOPE.) Realistic enough to be accessible but not a turn-off, and whimsically light enough at other times without straying into "Stefan-the-Frog" territory, (are you listening, David Kelley?), "Grey's" should remain as a dependable Sunday night staple as long as creator/producer Shonda Rhimes and her crew are able to continue to strike that balance, and keep its newfound audience interested and entertained with the trials, tribulations and trysts of the staff at Seattle Grace Hospital. helpful•130 43 cchase Nov 1, 2005 FAQ5 Season 17 E01 Do they get a pat on the back from the government for how many times they say Covid in one episode? lol If someone used a saying from one of the episodes, and put it on something with other words and pictures. Would that be copyright? Who sings the theme song?
