This results in a division in The Avengers. Iron Man stands with this Act, claiming that their actions must be kept in check otherwise cities will continue to be destroyed, but Captain America feels that saving the world is daring enough and that they cannot rely on the government to protect the world. This escalates into an all-out war between Team Iron Man (Iron Man, Black Panther, Vision, Black Widow, War Machine, and Spider-Man) and Team Captain America (Captain America, Bucky Barnes, Falcon, Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye, and Ant Man) while a new villain emerges. —RespectTheHyphen marvel cinematic universebased on comic booksuperherosiberiafriendship between men617 more Plot summary Plot synopsis Taglines Divided We Fall Genres Action Adventure Sci-Fi Motion Picture Rating (MPAA) Rated PG-13 for extended sequences of violence, action and mayhem Parents guide Did you know Edit Trivia The day before filming a fight scene with Robert Downey Jr., Sebastian Stan sent him a video of himself doing intense bicep curls in front of the decapitated head of an Iron Man suit. He attached the message, "Looking forward to our scene tomorrow Robert". Goofs The sleeve patches on the Russian soldiers in the beginning showing the flag of the modern day Russian Federation. The scene took place on 16 December 1991, the USSR was still in existence (though only for another 10 days). The soldiers would have had a red hammer and sickle on their patches instead. Quotes Ant-Man: [internally damaging the Iron Man suit] Oh, you're going to have to take this to the shop. Iron Man: Who's speaking? Ant-Man: It's your conscience. We don't talk a lot these days. Crazy credits SPOILER: There are two scenes in the closing credits: Bucky and Steve hide out in Wakanda, under the permission and assistance of King T'Challa. This leads into Black Panther (2018). Peter Parker awkwardly explains his injuries to Aunt May, and later sees a gadget Tony Stark made for him. This leads into Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017).

Who are the villains in the film? How could Steve Rogers (Captain America) already know the truth about the death of Tony Stark's parents?
