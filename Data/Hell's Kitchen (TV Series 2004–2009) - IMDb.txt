Connections Featured in The Big Fat Quiz of the Year (2004) User reviews3 Review Top review Keep Abi Titmuss Off Our Screens HELL`S KITCHEN is yet another celebrity reality TV show which revolves around a bunch of has been or never will be celebrities working in a kitchen under the command of Gordon Ramsay . If you don`t know who Gorgon Ramsay is let me tell you he`s one nasty sadistic bully , the TV chef from hell . He`s also very foul mouthed and every second word he says is the " F " word . However the impossible happened when Ramsay was beaten in the swearing stakes by Abi Titmuss Who`s Abi Titmuss ? you ask . If you`ve got to ask that then obviously you`ve been living on the moon . She`s a former nurse and the former girlfriend of former BLUE PETER presenter John Leslie who hit the tabloid news headlines a few months ago involving sleazy sexual shennaigans . In fact it`s been impossible to open a tabloid news paper without seeing Ms Titmuss in a state of undress openly bragging about her sexual exploits I will be honest and confess that I`m a massive fan of twenty something blonde nurses and to start off with did find Ms Titmuss ... how can I put it ? Visual viagra but the more I read of her confessions to the press the more and more I was turned off by her sordid sex life . I`m telling you there`s probably more than a few twenty something blonde nurses who`d like to organise a lynch mob for Abi after she`s lived up to every sexual stereotypical cliche of a nurse As we saw in HELL`S KITCHEN Titmuss is incapable of speaking without profane obscenities peppering the conversation and when she was voted out of the kitchen we were shown footage of Titmuss drunk doing an inpromptu striptease . It really is sad that an attractive middle class girl who no doubt is well educated can embarrass herself like that and I do feel sorry for both her parents . Would you want your daughter behaving like that on television ? So just remember - Not all twenty something blonde nurses are Abi Titmuss . Thank gawd for that . Hopefully we`ve seen the last of that foul mouthed slapper helpful•9 67 Theo Robertson Jun 9, 2004 Details Edit Release date May 23, 2004 (United Kingdom) Country of origin United Kingdom Language English Also known as ヘルズ・キッチン〜地獄の厨房 Production company Granada Television See more company credits at IMDbPro Technical specs Edit Runtime 1 hour Color Color Sound mix Stereo Related news Pierre White: 'Jamie loves publicity' Jun 27Digital Spy Contribute to this page Suggest an edit or add missing content Top Gap What is the English language plot outline for Hell's Kitchen (2004)?Answer See more gaps Learn more about contributing Edit page Add episode More to explore Photos Hollywood Romances: Our Favorite Couples See the entire gallery Photos Child Stars, Then and Now See the entire gallery Around the web Powered by Taboola Recently viewed You have no recently viewed pages Get the IMDb App Get the IMDb App Help Site Index IMDbPro Box Office Mojo IMDb Developer Press Room Advertising Jobs Conditions of Use Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads © 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.
